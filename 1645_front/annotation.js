From 1624 he served as Provost     of Eton College, about five miles from Milton\'s Horton home. Milton wrote     to Sir Henry on the 6th of April 1638 for his advice about his intended tour     of the continent and for possible letters of introduction to important people     abroad. He enclosed a copy of <span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask</span> as a gift,     and perhaps as a means to help Sir Henry take him seriously as a poet. Milton     published his kind response as a preface     to <a href=\"../comus/front_matter/text.shtml#wotton\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask</span></a> (in <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/114721/39\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span>     (1645)</a>.</p>  <p></span>",
