var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  Milton composed Sonnets 9 and 10 during the period of estrangement from his first wife, Mary Powell, between 1642 and 1645. This was also the period during which he wrote his divorce tracts wherein he attempts to redefine marriage, in radically Protestant terms, as conversation with a fit partner for the purpose of remedying a man\'s loneliness. (See <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/index.shtml\" target=\"newwindow\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Doctrine and Disciple of Divorce</span></a> and Luxon, <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#thomas_luxon\" target=\"newwindow\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Single Imperfection: Milton, Marriage and Friendship</span></a>.) Accordingly these two sonnets praise women in quite a different strain from the petrachan themes in his previous sonnets. Sonnet 9 celebrates the piety and temperance of just the sort of woman Milton may have wished he had married.</span>",
