Milton certainly performed such exercises (see his <a href=\"../../paraphrase_114/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">paraphrase on Psalm 114</a>), but many of the translations published in the <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/60223/79\" target=\"main\">1673 edition of <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span></a> appear to have been done as much for devotional as for linguistic exercise.  Certainly Milton also took pride in the breadth of metrical virtuosity displayed in these verse translations.</p><p>It is instructive to  compare Milton\'s translation with those of the <a href=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=Psalms+82\" target=\"main\">King James Version</a> and the <a href=\"http://ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Psalms/82.html\" target=\"main\">Geneva</a>.  Also interesting to compare is the  <a href=\"http://www.cgmusic.com/workshop/oldver/psalm_82.htm\" target=\"main\">Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins version</a> of 1562.</p><p>Italics indicate words that Milton has inserted to smooth out both the sense and the meter.  According to Milton, \"all but what is in a different Character, are the very words of the text, translated from the Original.\"</span>",
