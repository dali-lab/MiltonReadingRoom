var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  Sonnet IV describes the submission to desire of a man who previously had scorned all notions of love. The speaker claims to have fallen not for conventional features of female beauty&mdash;\"golden braids, nor vermillion cheeks\"&mdash;but his beloved\'s \"honest demeanor, and in the brow that calm, tender black splendor.\" Such claims provoke comparisons to the dark lady of Shakespeare\'s sonnets (see Shakespeare\'s <a href=\"http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/sonn03.htm#127\" target=\"main\">Sonnets 127</a>-152) Interestingly, the features this man finds irresistible are her demeanor and dark brow, which conjures parallels to Shakespeare\'s dark lady. While the Petrarchan rhetoric of love praises women for their fair hair, skin, and rosy cheeks, the speaker claims that he can resist all these traits, and instead some new attraction lies beneath such exotic beauty, and this he cannot resist. It is thought that the lady Milton refers to in these sonnets is Italian or of Italian heritage because of the emphasis on her exotic and darker features. Perhaps this lady, revealed to be Emilia in Sonnet 2, did not really exist, but Milton most likely wanted us to read her as an actual woman, especially as he describes her in such  detail in this sonnet.
