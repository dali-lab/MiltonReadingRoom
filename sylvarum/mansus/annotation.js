"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. Milton titled this collection of Latin and Greek verses, \"Sylvarum,\" or \"of the woods,\" indicating the variety of metrical forms included, even a variety of languages, since two are in Greek. The metrical forms employed here include iambics, hexameters and various kinds of Horatian modes, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcaic_stanza\" target=\"main\">alcaic stanzas</a>. Milton arranged the poems in a roughly chronological order according to their dates of composition, probably to emphasize his progress as a poet from his earliest attempts to his more mature poems.</p><p class=\"next\">Milton visited Giovanni Battista Manso, a wealthy patron of the arts and humanist academies, in Naples in November 1638.  \"During my stay,\" Milton recalled, Manso \"gave me singular proofs of his regard; he himself conducted me round the city, and to the palace of the viceroy; and more than once paid me a visit at my lodgings.\" Naples was the southernmost point of Milton\'s journey; in late December, \"melancholy intelligence . . . of civil commotions in England\" led Milton to curtail his original plans and turn back north. \"I thought it base,\" he wrote, \"to be traveling for amusement abroad, while my fellow-citizens were fighting for liberty at home\"  (<span class=\"booktitle\">Second Defense of the English People</span>).  Before leaving Italy, however, Milton spent another two months in Rome and two more in Florence.   Manso welcomed Milton, introduced him to his friends in the Accademia degli Oziosi which met at his home, and even contributed some <a href=\"../../poemata/english.shtml#manso\" target=\"main\">commendatory verses</a> that Milton published in his first collection of poems in 1645.  According to Milton, he would have done even more for him if Milton had not been so outspoken in his contempt for Roman Catholicism.</p><p class=\"next\">The translation follows that of <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mackellar_latin\" target=\"main\">Walter MacKellar</a> with a few changes based on consulting <a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#columbia_milton\" target=\"main\">The Columbia Milton</a> and <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Merritt Y.
