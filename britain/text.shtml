The beginning of Nations, those excepted of whom sacred Books have spok'n, is to this day unknown.  Nor only the beginning, but the deeds also of many succeeding Ages, yea periods of Ages, either wholly unknown, or obscur'd and blemisht with Fables.  Whether it were that the use of Letters came in long after, or were it the violence of barbarous inundations, or they themselves at certain revolutions of time, fatally decaying, and degenerating into Sloth and Ignorance; wherby the monuments of more ancient civility have bin som destroy'd, som lost.  Perhaps dis-esteem and contempt of the public affairs then present, as not worth recording, might partly be in cause.  Certainly 
oft-times we see that wise men, and of best abilitie, have forborn to write the Acts of thir own daies, while they beheld with a just loathing and disdain, not only how unworthy, how pervers, how corrupt, but often how ignoble, how petty, how below all History the person and thir actions were; who, either by fortune, or som rude election had attain'd as a sore judgment and ignominie upon the Land, to have chief sway in managing the Commonwealth.  But that any law, or superstition of our 
old Philosophers the <I>Druids</I> forbad the <I>Britains</I> to write thir memorable deeds, I know not why any out of <I>Caesar</I> should allege: he indeed saith, that thir doctrine they thought not lawful to commit to Letters; but in most matters else, both privat, and public, among which well may 
History be reck'nd, they us'd the Greek Tongue: and that the <I>British Druids</I> who taught those in <I>Gaule</I> would be ignorant of any Language known and us'd by thir Disciples, or so frequently writing other things, and so inquisitive into highest, would for want of recording be ever Children in the Knowledge of Times and Ages, is not likely.  What ever might be the reason, this we find, that of <I>British Affairs</I>, from the first peopling of the Iland to the coming of <I>Julius Caesar</I>, nothing certain, either by Tradition, History, or Ancient Fame hath hitherto bin left us.  That which we have of oldest seeming, hath by the greater part of judicious Antiquaries bin long rejected for a modern Fable.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Nevertheless there being others, besides the first suppos'd Author, men not unread, nor unlerned in Antiquitie, who admitt that for approved story, which the former explode for fiction, and seeing that oft-times relations heertofore accounted fabulous have bin after found to contain in them many footsteps, and reliques of somthing true, as what we read in Poets of the Flood, and Giants little beleev'd, till undoubted witnesses taught us, that all was not fain'd; I have therfore determin'd to bestow the telling over ev'n of these reputed Tales; be it for nothing else but in favour of our English Poets, and Rhetoricians, who by thir Art will know, how to use them judiciously.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">I might also produce example, as <I>Diodorus</I> among the <I>Greeks</I>, <I>Livy</I> and others of the <I>Latines</I>, <I>Polydore</I> and <I>Virunnius</I> accounted among our own Writers.  But I intend not with controversies and quotations to delay or interrupt the smooth course of History; much less to argue and debate long who were the first Inhabitants, with what probabilities, what authorities each opinion hath bin upheld, but shall endeavor that which hitherto hath bin needed most, with plain, and lightsom brevity, to relate well and orderly things worth the noting, so as may best instruct and benefit them that read.  Which, imploring divine assistance, that it may redound to his glory, and the good of the <I>British</I> Nation, <I>I now begin.</I><BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">That the whole Earth was inhabited before the Flood, and to the utmost point of habitable ground, from those effectual words of <I>God</I> in the Creation, may be more then conjectur'd.  Hence that this Iland also had her dwellers, her affairs, and perhaps her stories, eev'n in that old World those many hunderd years, with much reason we may inferr.  After the Flood, and the dispersing of Nations, as they journey'd leasurely from the East, <I>Gomer</I> the eldest Son of <I>Japhet</I>, and his off-spring, as by Authorities, Arguments, and Affinitie of divers names is generally beleev'd, were the first that peopl'd all these West and Northren Climes.  But they of our own Writers, who thought they had don nothing, unless with all circumstance they tell us when, and who first set foot upon this Iland, presume to name out of fabulous and counterfet Authors a certain <I>Samothes</I> or <I>Dis</I>, a fowrth or sixt Son of <I>Japhet</I>, whom they make about 200 years after the Flood, to have planted with Colonies, first the Continent of <I>Celtica</I> or <I>Gaule</I>, and next <I>this Iland</I>; Thence to have nam'd it <I>Samothea</I>, to have reign'd heer, and after him lineally fowr Kings, <I>Magus</I>, <I>Saron</I>, <I>Druis</I>, and <I>Bardus.</I>  But the forg'd <I>Berosus</I>, whom only they have to cite, no where mentions that either hee, or any of those whom they bring, did ever pass into <I>Britain</I>, or send thir people hither.  So that this outlandish figment may easily excuse our not allowing it the room heer so much as of a <I>British</I> Fable.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">


That which follows, perhaps as wide from Truth, though seeming less impertinent, is, that these Samotheans under the Reign of Bardus 
were subdu'd by Albion a Giant, Son of Neptune; who call'd the Island 
after his own Name, and ruled it 44 Years.  Till at length passing over 
into Gaul, in aid of his Brother Lestrygon, against whom Hercules was 
hasting out of Spain into Italy, he was there slain in fight, and 
Bergion also his Brother.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Sure enough we are, that Britain hath been anciently term'd 
Albion, both by the Greeks and Romans.  And Mela, the Geographer, makes 
mention of a stony shore in Languedoc, where by report such a Battel was 
fought.  The rest, as his giving name to the Isle, or ever landing here, 
depends altogether upon late Surmises.  But too absurd, and too 
unconscionably gross is that fond Invention that wafted hither the fifty 
Daughters of a strange Dioclesian King of Syria; brought in, doubtless, 
by some illiterate Pretender to something mistaken in the common 
poetical Story of Danaus King of Argos, while his Vanity, not pleas'd 
with the obscure beginning which truest Antiquity affords the Nation, 
labour'd to contrive us a Pedigree, as he thought, more noble.  These 
Daughters by appointment of Danaus on the Marriage-night having murder'd 
all their Husbands, except Linceus, whom his Wife's Loyalty sav'd, were 
by him, at the suit of his Wife their Sister, not put to death, but 
turn'd out to Sea in a Ship unmann'd; of which whole Sex they had 
incur'd the hate: and as the Tale goes, were driven on this Island.  
Where the Inhabitants, none but Devils, as some write, or as others, a 
lawless Crew left here by Albion, without Head or Governor, both 
entertain'd them, and had Issue by them a second Breed of Giants, who 
tyranniz'd the Isle, till Brutus came.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The eldest of these Dames in their Legend they call Albina; and 
from thence, for which cause the whole Scene was fram'd, will have the 
Name Albion deriv'd.  Incredible it may seem so sluggish a Conceit 
should prove so ancient, as to be authoriz'd by the Elder Ninnius, 
reputed to have liv'd above a thousand years ago.  This I find not in 
him; but that Histion sprung of Japhet, had four Sons; Francus, Romanus, 
Alemannus, and Britto, of whom the Britains; as true, I believe, as that 
those other Nations whose names are resembl'd, came of the other three; 
of these Dreams give not just occasion to call in doubt the Book it 
self, which bears that title.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Hitherto the things themselves have given us a warrantable 
dispatch to run them soon over.  But now of Brutus and his Line, with 
the whole Progeny of Kings, to the entrance of Julius C[ae]sar, we cannot 
so easily be discharg'd; Descents of Ancestry, long continu'd, Laws and 
Exploits not plainly seeming to be borrow'd, or devis'd, which on the 
common belief have wrought no small impression; defended by many, deny'd 
utterly by few.  For what though Brutus, and the whole Trojan pretence 
were yielded up, seeing they who first devis'd to bring us from some 
noble Ancestor, were content at first with Brutus the Consul; till 
better invention, although not willing to forgo the name, taught them to 
remove it higher into a more fabulous Age, and by the same remove 
lighting on the Trojan Tales in affectation to make the Britain of one 
Original with the Roman, pitch'd there; yet those old and inborn names 
of successive Kings, never any to have bin real Person, or done in their 
lives at least some part of what so long hath bin remember'd, cannot be 
thought without too strict an incredulity.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">For these, and those causes above mention'd, that which hath 
receiv'd Approbation from so many, I have chosen not to omit.  Certain 
or uncertain, be that upon the Credit of those whom I must follow; so 
far as keeps aloof from impossible and absurd, attested by ancient 
Writers from Books more ancient, I refuse not, as the due and proper 
subject of Story.  The principal Author is well known to be Geoffrey of 
Monmouth; what he was, and whence his Authority, who in his Age, or 
before him, have deliver'd the same matter, and such like general 
Discourses, will better stand in a Treatise by themselves.  All of them 
agree in this, that Brutus was the Son of Silvius; he of Ascanius; whose 
Father was [ae]neas a Trojan Prince, who at the burning of that City, with 
his Son Ascanius, and a collected number that escap'd, after long 
wandering on the Sea, arriv'd in Italy.  Where at length by the 
assistance of Latinus King of Latium, who had given him his Daughter 
Lavinia, he obtain'd to succeed in that Kingdom, and left it to 
Ascanius, whose Son Silvius (though Roman Histories deny Silvius to be 
Son of Ascanius) had married secretly a Niece of Lavinia.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">She being with child, the matter became known to Ascanius.  Who 
commanding his Magicians to enquire by Art, what Sex the Maid had 
conceiv'd, had answer, that it was one who should be the death of both 
his Parents; and banish'd for the Fact, should after all in a far 
Country, attain to highest Honour.  The Prediction fail'd not, for in 
Travail the Mother died.  And Brutus (the Child was so call'd) at 
fifteen years of Age, attending his Father to the Chace, with an Arrow 
unfortunately kill'd him.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Banish'd therfore by his kindred, he retires into Greece.  Where 
meeting with the race of Helenus King Priam's Son, held there in servile 
condition by Pandrasus then King, with them he abides.  For Pirrhus in 
revenge of his Father slain at Troy, had brought thither with him 
Helenus, and many others into servitude.  There Brutus among his own 
Stock so thrives in Vertue and in Arms, as renders him belov'd to Kings, 
and great Captains, above all the Youth of that Land.  Wherby the 
Trojans not only begin to hope, but secretly to move him, that he would 
lead them the way to liberty.  They allege their numbers, and the 
promis'd help of Assaracus a Noble Greekish Youth, by the Mother's side 
a Trojan; whom for that cause his Brother went about to dispossess of 
certain Castles bequeath'd him by his Father.  Brutus considering both 
the Forces offer'd him, and the strength of those Holds, not unwillingly 
consents.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> First therfore having fortify'd those Castles, he with Assaracus 
and the whole Multitude betake them to the Woods and Hills, as the 
safest place from whence to expostulate; and in the name of all sends to 
Pandrasus this Message; That the Trojans holding it unworthy their 
Ancestors to serve in a foreign Kingdom had retreated to the Woods; 
choosing rather a savage life then a slavish: If that displeas'd him, 
that then with his leave they might depart to some other Soil.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> As this may pass with good allowance, that the Trojans might be 
many in these parts, for Helenus was by Pirrhus made King of the 
Chaonians, and the Sons of Pirrhus by Andromache Hector's Wife, could 
not but be powerful through all Epirus, so much the more it may be 
doubted, how these Trojans could be thus in bondage, where they had 
Friends and Country-men so potent.  But to examine these things with 
diligence, were but to confute the Fables of Britain, with the Fables of 
Greece or Italy; for of this age, what we have to say, as well 
concerning most other Countries, as this Island, is equally under 
question.  Be how it will, Pandrasus not expecting so bold a Message 
from the Sons of Captives, gathers an Army; and marching toward the 
Woods, Brutus who had notice of his approach nigh to a Town call'd 
Sparatinum, (I know not what Town, but certain of no Greek name) over 
night planting himself there with good part of his men, suddenly sets 
upon him, and with slaughter of the Greeks pursues him to the passage of 
a River, which mine Author names Akalon, meaning perhaps Achelous, or 
Acheron; where at the Ford he overlays them afresh.  This victory 
obtain'd, and a sufficient strength left in Sparatinum, Brutus with 
Antigonus, the King's Brother, and his Friend Anacletus, whom he had 
taken in the fight, returns to the residue of his Friends in the thick 
Woods; while Pandrasus with all speed recollecting, besieges the Town.  
Brutus to relieve his men besieged, who earnestly call'd him, 
distrusting the sufficiency of his Force, bethinks himself of this 
Policy.  Calls to him Anacletus, and threatening instant death else, 
both to him and his friend Antigonus, enjoins him, that he should go at 
the second Hour of Night to the Greekish Leagre, and tell the Guards he 
had brought Antigonus by stealth out of Prison to a certain woody Vale, 
unable through the weight of his Fetters to move further; entreating 
them to come speedily and fetch him in.  Anacletus to save both himself 
and his friend Antigonus, swears this, and at a fit hour sets on alone 
toward the Camp; is met, examin'd, and at last unquestionably known.  To 
whom, great profession of Fidelity first made, he frames his Tale, as 
had been taught him; and they now fully assur'd, with a creduous 
rashness leaving their Stations, far'd accordingly by the Ambush that 
there awaited them.  Forthwith Brutus dividing his men into three parts, 
leads on in silence to the Camp; commanding first each part at a several 
place to enter, and forbear Execution, till he with his Squadron 
possess'd of the King's Tent, gave Signal to them by Trumpet.  The sound 
wherof no sooner heard, but huge Havock begins upon the sleeping, and 
unguarded Enemy; whom the besieged also now sallying forth, on the other 
side assail.  Brutus the while had special care to seize and secure the 
King's Person; whose Life still within his custody, he knew was the 
surest pledge to obtain what he should demand.  Day appearing, he enters 
the Town, there distributes the King's Treasury, and leaving the place 
better fortify'd, returns with the King his Prisoner to the Woods.  
Strait the antient and grave men he summons to Counsel, what they should 
now demand of the King.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> After long debate Mempricius, one of the gravest, utterly 
dissuading them from thought of longer stay in Greece, unless they meant 
to be deluded with a suttle Peace, and the awaited revenge of those 
whose Friends they had slain, advises them to demand first the King's 
Eldest Daughter Innogen in marriage to their Leader Brutus with a rich 
Dowry, next Shipping, Money, and fit Provision for them all to depart 
the Land.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> This resolution pleasing best, the King now brought in, and plac'd 
in a high Seat, is briefly told, that on these Conditions granted, he 
might be free; not granted, he must prepare to die.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> Press'd with fear of death, the King readily yields; especially to 
bestow his Daughter on whom he confess'd so Noble and so Valiant: offers 
them also the third part of his Kingdom, if they like to stay; if not, 
to be their Hostage himself, till he had made good his word.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> The Marriage therefore solemniz'd, and shipping from all parts got 
together, the Trojans in a Fleet, no less written then three hundred 
four and twenty Sail, betake them to the wide Sea: where, with a 
prosperous Course two days and a Night bring them on a certain Island 
long before dispeopl'd and left waste by Sea-Rovers, the name wherof was 
then Leogecia, now unknown.  They who were sent out to discover, came at 
length to a ruin'd City, where was a Temple and Image of Diana that gave 
Oracles: but not meeting first or last, save wild Beasts, they return 
with this notice to their Ships; wishing their General would enquire of 
that Oracle what Voyage to pursue.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> Consultation had, Brutus taking with him Gerion his Diviner, and 
twelve of the ancientest, with wonted Ceremonies before the inward 
shrine of the Goddess, in Verse, as it seems the manner was, utters his 
request, Diva potens nemorum, &c.

Goddess of Shades, and Huntress, who at will
Walk'st on the rowling Sphere, and through the deep,
On thy third Reign the Earth took now, and tell
What Land, what Seat of rest thou bidst me seek, 
What certain Seat, where I may worship thee
For aye, with Temples vow'd, and Virgin quires.

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> To whom sleeping before the Altar, Diana in a Vision that night 
thus answer'd, Brute sub occasum Solis, &c.

Brutus far to the West, in th' Ocean wide,
Beyond the Realm of Gaul, a Land there lies,
Sea-girt it lies, where Giants dwelt of old,
Now void, it fits thy People; thither bend
Thy course, there shalt thou find a lasting seat,
There to thy Sons another Troy shall rise,
And Kings be born of thee, whose dreaded might
Shall awe the World, and conquer Nations bold.

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> These Verses originally Greek, were put in Latin, saith Virunnius, 
by Gildas a British Poet, and him to have liv'd under Claudius.  Which 
granted true, adds much to the Antiquity of this Fable; and indeed the 
Latin Verses are much better, then for the Age of Geoffrey ap Arthur, 
unless perhaps Joseph of Exeter, the only smooth Poet of those times, 
befriended him.  In this, Diana overshot her Oracle thus ending, Ipsis 
totius terr[ae] subditus orbis erit, That to the Race of Brute Kings of 
this Island, the whole Earth shall be subject.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> But Brutus guided now, as he thought, by divine Conduct, speeds 
him towards the West; and after some encounters on the Afric side, 
arrives at a place on the Tyrrhene Sea; where he happens to find the 
Race of those Trojans, who with Antenor came into Italy; and Corineus  a 
man much fam'd, was their Chief: though by surer Authors it be reported, 
that those Trojans with Antenor, were seated on the other side of Italy, 
on the Adriatic, not the Tyrrhene Shore.  But these joining Company, and 
past the Herculean Pillars, at the mouth of Ligeris in Aquitania cast 
Anchor: Where after some discovery made of the Place, Corineus hunting 
nigh the shore with his Men, is by Messengers of the King Goffarius 
Pictus met, and question'd about his Errand there.  Who not answering to 
their mind, Imbertus, one of them, lets fly an Arrow at Corineus, which 
he avoiding, slays him: and the Pictavian himself hereupon levying his 
whole Force, is overthrown by Brutus, and Corineus; who with the Battel 
Ax which he was wont to manage against the Tyrrhene Giants, is said to 
have done marvels.  But Goffarius having drawn to his aid the whole 
Country of Gaul, at that time govern'd by twelve Kings, puts his Fortune 
to a second Trial; wherein the Trojans over-born by Multitude, are 
driven back, and besieged in their own Camp, which by good foresight was 
strongly situate.  Whence Brutus unexpectedly issuing out, and Corineus 
in the mean while, whose device it was, assaulting them behind from a 
Wood, where he had convey'd his men the night before: The Trojans are 
again Victors, but with the loss of Turon a valiant Nephew of Brutus; 
whose Ashes left in that place, gave name to the City of Tours, built 
there by the Trojans.  Brutus finding now his Powers much lessen'd, and 
this yet not the place foretold him, leaves Aquitain, and with an easy 
course, arriving at Totness in Devonshire, quickly perceives here to be 
the promis'd end to his Labours.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> The Island not yet Britain but Albion, was in a manner desert and 
inhospitable; kept only by a remnant of Giants, whose excessive Force 
and Tyranny had consum'd the rest.  Them Brutus destroys, and to his 
People divides the Land, which with some reference to his own Name he 
thenceforth calls Britain.  To Corineus, Cornwal, as now we call it, 
fell by Lot; the rather by him lik'd, for that the hugest Giants in 
Rocks and Caves were said to lurk still there; which kind of Monsters to 
deal with was his old Exercise.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> And here with leave be spoken to recite a grand Fable, though 
dignify'd by our best Poets; while Brutus on a certain Festival Day 
solemnly kept on that shore, where he first landed, was with the People 
in great jollity and mirth, a crew of these Savages breaking in upon 
them, began on the sudden another sort of Game, then at such a meeting 
was expected.  But at length by many hands overcome, Goemagog the 
hugest, in height twelve Cubits, is reserv'd alive, that with him 
Corineus, who desir'd nothing more, might try his strength; whom in a 
Wrestle the Giant catching aloft, with a terrible hug broke three of his 
Ribs: nevertheless Corineus enrag'd, heaving him up by main force, and 
on his Shoulders bearing him to the next high Rock, threw him headlong, 
all shatter'd, into the Sea, and left his Name on the Cliff, call'd ever 
since Langoemagog, which is to say, the Giant's Leap.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> After this, Brutus in a chosen place builds Troja nova, chang'd in 
time to Trinovantum, now London: and began to enact Laws; Heli being 
then high Priest in Jud[ae]a: and having govern'd the whole Isle 24 Years, 
died, and was buried in his new Troy.  His three Sons, Locrine, 
Albanact, and Camber divide the Land by consent.  Locrine had the middle 
part Loegria; Camber possess'd Cambria, or Wales; Albanact, Albania, now 
Scotland.  But he in the end by Humber King of the Hunns, who with a 
Fleet invaded that Land, was slain in fight, and his People driven back 
into Loegria.  Locrine and his Brother go out against Humber; who now 
marching onward, was by them defeated, and in a River drown'd, which to 
this day retains its name.  Among the spoils of his Camp and Navy, were 
found certain young Maids, and Estrildis above the rest, passing fair, 
the Daughter of a King in Germany; from whence Humber, as he went 
wasting the Sea-Coast, had led her Captive whom Locrine, though before 
contracted to the Daughter of Corineus, resolves to marry.  But being 
forc'd and threaten'd by Corineus, whose Authority and Power he fear'd, 
Guendolen the Daughter he yields to marry, but in secret loves the 
other: and oft-times retiring, as to some private Sacrifice, through 
Vaults and Passages made under ground, and seven Years thus enjoying 
her, had by her a Daughter equally fair, whose Name was Sabra.  But when 
once his fear was off by the Death of Corineus, not content with secret 
Enjoyment, divorcing Guendolen, he makes Estrildis now his Queen.  
Guendolen all in rage departs into Cornwal, where Madan, the Son she had 
by Locrine, was hitherto brought up by Corineus his Grandfather.  And 
gathering an Army of her Father's Friends and Subjects, gives battel to 
her Husband by the River Sture; wherein Locrine shot with an Arrow ends 
his Life.  But not so ends the fury of Guendolen; for Estrildis and her 
Daughter Sabra, she throws into the River: and to leave a Monument of 
Revenge, proclaims, that the stream be thenceforth call'd after the 
Damsel's Name; which by length of time is chang'd now to Sabrina, or 
Severn.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> Fifteen years she governs in behalf of her Son; then resigning to 
him at Age, retires to her Father's Dominion.  This, saith my Author, 
was in the days of Samuel.  Madan hath the praise to have well and 
peacefully rul'd the space of 40 Years, leaving behind him two Sons, 
Mempricius, and Malim.  Mempricius had first to do with the ambition of 
his Brother, aspiring to share with him in the Kingdom; whom therefore 
at a meeting to compose matters, with a treachery, which his Cause 
needed not, he slew.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> Nor was he better in the sole possession, whereof so ill he could 
endure a Partner, killing his Nobles, and those especially next to 
succeed him; till lastly given over to unnatural Lust, in the twentieth 
of his Reign, hunting in a Forest, he was devour'd by Wolves.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> His Son Ebranc, a Man of mighty Strength and Stature, reign'd 40 
Years.  He first after Brutus wasted Gaul; and returning rich and 
prosperous, builded Caerebranc, nowYork; in Albania, Alclud, Mount 
Agned, or the Castle of Maydens, now Edinburgh.  He had 20 Sons and 30 
Daughters by 20 Wives.  His Daughters he sent to Silvius Alba into 
Italy, who bestow'd them on his Peers of the Trojan Line.  His Sons 
under the leading of Assaracus their Brother, won them Lands and 
Signories in Germany; thence call'd from these Brethren, Germania: a 
Derivation too hastily suppos'd, perhaps before the word Germanus, or 
the Latin tongue was in use.  Some who have describ'd Henault, as 
Jacobus Bergomas, and Lessabeus, are cited to affirm that Ebranc in his 
War there, was by Brunchildis, Lord of Henault, put to the worse.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> Brutus therfore, surnam'd Greenfield, succeeding, to repair his 
Father's Losses, as the same Lessabeus reports, fought a second Battel 
in Henault, with Brunchild, at the mouth of Scaldis, and encamp'd on the 
River Hanin.  Of which our Spencer also thus sings:

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> Let Scaldis tell, and let tell Hania,
          <BLOCKQUOTE>And let the Marsh of Esthambruges tell
          What colour were their Waters that same day,
          And all the Moor 'twixt Elversham and Dell,
          With Blood of Henalois, which therein fell;
          How oft that day did sad Brunchildis see
          The Greenshield dy'd in dolorous Vermeil, &c.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">But Henault, and Brunchild, and Greenshield, seem newer Names then 
for a story pretended thus ancient.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Him succeeded Leil,  a maintainer of Peace and Equity; but 
slacken'd in his latter end, whence arose some civil discord.  He built 
in the North Cairleil; and in the days of Solomon.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Rudhuddibras, or Hudibras, appeasing the Commotions which his 
Father could not, founded Caerkeynt or Canterbury, Caerguent or 
Winchester, and Mount Paladur, now Septonia or Shaftesbury: but this by 
other is contradicted.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Bladud his Son built Caerbadus or Bath, and those medicinal Waters 
he dedicated to Minerva; in whose Temple there, he kept Fire continually 
burning.  He was a Man of great Invention, and taught Necromancy: till 
having made him Wings to fly, he fell down upon the Temple of Apollo in 
Trinovant, and so died after twenty Years reign.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Hitherto from Father to Son the direct Line hath run on: but Leir, 
who next reign'd, had only three Daughters, and no Male Issue; govern'd 
laudably, and built Caer-Leir, now Leicester, on the bank of Sora.  But 
at last, failing through Age, he determines to bestow his Daughters, and 
so among them to divide his Kingdom.  Yet first to try which of them 
lov'd him best, (a Trial that might have made him, had he known as 
wisely how to try, as he seem'd to know how much the trying behoov'd 
him) he resolves a simple Resolution, to ask them solemnly in order; and 
which of them should profess largest, her to believe.  Gonorill the 
eldest, apprehending too well her Father's weakness, makes answer, 
invoking Heaven, That she lov'd him above her Soul.  Therefore, quoth 
the Old Man overjoy'd, since thou so honourest my declining Age, to thee 
and the Husband whom thou shall choose, I give the third part of my 
Realm.  So fair a speeding for a few words soon utter'd, was to Regan 
the second, ample instruction what to say.  She on the same demand 
spares no protesting, and the Gods must witness, that otherwise to 
express her Thoughts she knew not, but that she lov'd him above all 
Creatures; and so receives an equal reward with her Sister.  But 
Cordeilla the youngest, though hitherto best belov'd, and now before her 
eyes the rich and present hire of a little easy soothing, the danger 
also, and the loss likely to betide plain dealing, yet moves not from 
the solid purpose of a sincere and virtuous Answer.  Father, saith she, 
my love towards you is as my Duty bids; what should a Father seek, what 
can a Child promise more? they who pretend beyond this, flatter.  When 
the old Man, sorry to hear this, and wishing her to recall those words, 
persisted asking, with a loyal sadness at her Father's infirmity, but 
something on the sudden, harsh, and glancing rather at her Sisters, then 
speaking her own mind, Two ways only, saith she, I have to answer what 
you require me; the former, your command is, I should recant; accept 
then this other which is left me; look how much you have, so much is 
your value, and so much I love you.  Then hear thou, quoth Leir now all 
in passion, what thy Ingratitude hath gain'd thee; because thou hast not 
reverenc'd thy aged Father equal to thy Sisters, part in my Kingdom, or 
what else is mine, reckon to have none.  And without delay, gives in 
marriage his other Daughters, Gonorill to Maglaunus Duke of Albania, 
Regan to Henninus Duke of Cornwal; with them in present half his 
Kingdom; the rest to follow at his death.  In the mean while Fame was 
not sparing to divulge the Wisdom and other Graces of Cordeilla, 
insomuch that Aganippus a great King in Gaul (however he came by his 
Greek Name, not found in any Register of French Kings) seeks her to 
Wife, and nothing alter'd at the loss of her Dowry, receives her gladly 
in such manner as she was sent him.  After this King Leir more and more 
drooping with Years, became an easy Prey to his Daughters, and their 
Husbands; who now by daily encroachment had seiz'd the whole Kingdom 
into their hands: and the old King is put to sojourn with his eldest 
Daughter, attended only by threescore Knights.  But they in a short 
while grudg'd at, as too numerous and disorderly for continual Guests, 
are reduc'd to thirty.  Not brooking that Affront, the old King betakes 
him to his second Daughter: but there also Discord soon arising between 
the Servants of differing Masters in one Family, five only are suffer'd 
to attend him.  Then back again he returns to the other; hoping that she 
his eldest could not but have more pity on his grey Hairs: but she now 
refuses to admit him, unless he be content with one only of his 
Followers.  At last the remembrance of his youngest Cordeilla comes to 
his thoughts; and now acknowledging how true her words had bin, though 
with little hope from whom he had so injur'd, be it but to pay her the 
last recompence she can have from him, his confression of her wise 
forewarning, that so perhaps his Misery, the proof and experiment of her 
Wisdom, might something soften her, he takes his Journey into France.  
Now might be seen a difference between the silent, or downright spoken 
Affection of some Children to their Parents, and the talkative 
Obsequiousness of others; while the hope of Inheritance over-acts them, 
and on the Tongue's end enlarges their Duty.  Cordeilla our of meer 
love, without the suspicion of expected Reward, at the message only of 
her Father in distress, pours forth true filial Tears.  And not enduring 
either that her own, or any other Eye should see him in such forlorn 
condition as his Messenger declar'd, discreetly appoints one of her 
trusted Servants, first to convey him privately towards some good Sea-
Town, there to array him, bathe him, cherish him, furnish him with such 
Attendance and State, as beseem'd his Dignity, that then, as from his 
first landing, he might send word of his Arrival to her Husband 
Aganippus.  Which done with all mature, and requisite contrivance, 
Cordeilla with the King her Husband, and all the Barony of his Realm, 
who then first had news of his passing the Sea, go out to meet him; and 
after all honourable and joyful Entertainment, Aganippus, as to his 
Wife's Father, and his Royal Guest, surrenders him, during his abode 
there, the power, and disposal of his whole Diminion: permitting his 
Wife Cordeilla to go with an Army, and set her Father upon his Throne.  
Wherein her Piety so prosper'd, as that she vanquish'd her impious 
Sisters with those Dukes; and Leir again, as saith the Story, three 
Years obtain'd the Crown.  To whom dying, Cordeilla with all regal 
Solemnities gave burial in the Town of Leicester.  And then as right 
Heir succeeding, and her Husband dead, rul'd the Land five Years in 
peace.  Until Marganus and Cunedagius her two Sisters Sons, not bearing 
that a Kingdom should be govern'd by a Woman, in the unseasonablest time 
to raise that quarrel against a Woman so worthy, make war against her, 
depose her, and imprison her; of which impatient, and now long 
unexercis'd, to suffer, she there, as is related, kill'd herself.  The 
Victors between them part the Land; but Marganus, the eldest Sister's 
Son, who held, by agreement, from the North-side of Humber to Cathness, 
incited by those about him to invade all as his own right, wars on 
Cunedagius, who soon met him, overcame, and overtook him in a Town of 
Wales, where he left his life, and ever since his Name to the place.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Cunedagius was now sole King, and govern'd with much praise many 
Years, about the time when Rome was built.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">His succeeded Rivallo his Son, wise also and fortunate; save what 
they tell us of three days raining Blood, and swarms of stinging Flies, 
whereof Men died.  In order then Gurgustius, Jago or Lago, his Nephew; 
Sisilius, Kinmarcus.  Then Gorboguda, whom others name Gorbodego, and 
Gorbodion, who had two Sons, Ferrex and Porrex.  They in the old Age of 
their Father falling to contend who should succeed, Porrex attempting by 
Treachery his Brother's Life, drives him into France; and in his return, 
though aided with the Force of that Country, defects and stays him.  But 
by his Mother Videna, who less lov'd him, is himself, with the 
assistance of her Women, soon after slain in his Bed: With whom ended, 
as is thought, the Line of Brutus.  Wherupon, the whole Land with civil 
Broils was rent into five Kingdoms, long time waging War each on other; 
and some say 50 years.  At length Dunwallo Molmutius the Son of Cornwal, 
one of the foresaid five, excelling in Valour, and goodliness of Person, 
after his Father's decease, found means to reduce again the whole Island 
into a Monarchy; subduing the rest at Opportunities.  First, Ymner King 
of Loegria, whom he slew; then Rudaucus of Cambria, Staterius of 
Albania, confederate together.  In which fight Dunwallo is reported, 
while the Victory hung doubtful, to have us'd this Art.  He takes with 
him 600 stout Men, bids them put on the Armour of their slain Enemies; 
and so unexpectedly approaching the Squadron, where those two Kings had 
plac'd themselves in fight, from that part which they thought securest, 
assaults and dispatches them.  Then displaying his own Ensigns which 
before he had conceal'd, and sending notive to the other part of his 
Army what was done, adds to them new Courage, and gains a final Victory.  
This Dunwallo was the first in Britain that wore a Crown of Gold; and 
therfore by some reputed the first King.  He established the Molmutine 
Laws, famous among the English to this day; written long after by 
Gildas, and in Saxon by King Alfred: So saith Geoffrey, but Gildas 
denies to have known aught of the Britains before C[ae]sar; much less knew 
Alfred.  These Laws, whoever made them, bestow'd on Temples the 
Privilege of Sanctuary; to Cities also, and the ways thither leading, 
yea to Plows granted a kind of like refuge; and made such riddance of 
Thieves and Robbers, that all Passages were safe.  Forty years he 
govern'd alone, and was buried nigh to the Temple of Concord; which he, 
to the memory of Peace restor'd, had built in Trinovant.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">His two Sons, Belinus and Brennus, contending about the Crown, by 
decision of Friends, came at length to an Accord; Brennus to have the 
North of Humber, Belinus the Sovereignty of all.  But the younger not 
long so contented, that he, as they wisper'd to him, whose Valour had so 
oft repell'd the Invasions of Ceulphus the Morine Duke, should now be 
subject to his Brother, upon new Design sails into Norway; enters League 
and Affinity with Elfing that King: which Belinus perceiving, in his 
absence dispossesses him of all the North.  Brennus with a Fleet of 
Norwegians, makes towards Britain; but encounter'd by Guithlac the 
Danish King, who laying claim to his Bride, pursu'd him on the Sea; his 
haste was retarded, and he bereft of his Spouse: who from the Fight by a 
sudden Tempest, was with the Danish King driven on Northumberland, and 
brought to Belinus.  Brennus nevertheless finding means to recollect his 
Navy, lands in Albania, and gives battel to his Brother in the Wood 
Calaterium; but losing the day, escapes with one single Ship into Gaul.  
Mean while the Dane, upon his own offer to become tributary, sent home 
with his new Prize, Belinus returns his thoughts to the administring of 
Justice, and the perfecting of his Father's Law.  And to explain what 
Highways might enjoy the foresaid Privileges, he caus'd to be drawn out 
and pav'd four main Roads to the utmost length and breadth of the 
Island, and two others athwart; which are since attributed to the 
Romans.  Brennus on the other side solliciting to his Aid the Kings of 
Gaul, happens at last on Seginus Duke of the Allobroges; where his 
worth, and comeliness of Person, won him the Duke's Daughter and Heir.  
In whose Right he shortly succeeding, and by obtain'd leave passing with 
a great Host through the length of Gaul, gets footing once again in 
Britain.  Now was Belinus unprepar'd: And now the Battel ready to join, 
Conuvenna the Mother of them both, all in a fright throws her self 
between; and calling earnestly to Brennus her Son, whose absence had so 
long depriv'd her of his sight, after imbracements and tears, assails 
him with such a motherly Power, and the mention of things so dear and 
reverend, as irresistibly wrung from him all his Enmity against Belinus.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Then hands are join'd, Reconciliation made firm, and Counsel held 
to turn their united Preparations on Foreign parts.  Thence that by 
these two all Gallia was over-run, the Story tells; and what they did in 
Italy, and at Rome, if these be they, and not Gauls, who took that City, 
the Roman Authors can best relate.  So far from home I undertake not for 
the Monmouth Chronicle; which here against the stream of History carries 
up and down these Brethren, now into Germany, then again to Rome, 
pursuing Gabius and Porsena, two unheard of Consuls.  Thus much is more 
generally believ'd, that both this Brennus, and another Captain, 
Britomarus, whom the Epitomist Florus and others mention, were not Gauls 
but Britains; the name of the first in that Tongue signifying a King, 
and of the other a Great Britain.  However Belinus after a while 
returning hme, the rest of his days rul'd in Peace, Wealth, and Honour 
above all his Predecessors; building some Cities, of which one was 
Caerose upon Osca, since Caerlegion; beautifying others, as Trinovant, 
with a Gate, a Haven, and a Tower, on the Thames, retaining yet his 
Name; on the top wherof his Ashes are said to have been laid up in a 
Golden Urn.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">After him Gurguntius Barbirus was King, mild and just, but yet 
inheriting his Father's Courage; he subdu'd the Dacian, or Dane, who 
refus'd to pay the Tribute covenanted to Belinus for his Enlargement.  
In his return finding about the Orkneys 30 Ships of Spain, or Biscay, 
fraught with Men and Women for a Plantation, whose Captain also 
Bartholinus wrongfully banish'd, as he pleaded, besought him that some 
part of his Territory might be assign'd them to dwell in, he sent with 
them certain of his own Men to Ireland, which then lay unpeopl'd; and 
gave them that Island to hold of him as in Homage.  He was buried in 
Caerlegion, a City which he had wall'd about.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Guitheline his Son is also remember'd as a just and good Prince, 
and his Wife Martia to have excell'd so much in Wisdom, as to venture 
upon a new Institution of Laws.  Which King Alfred translating, call'd 
Marchen Leage; but more truly thereby is meant, the Mercian Law; not 
translated by Alfred, but digested or incorporated with the West-Saxon.  
In the Minority of her Son she had the Rule; and then, as may be 
suppos'd, brought forth these Laws, not herself, for Laws are Masculine 
Births, but by the Advice of her sagest Counsellors; and therein she 
might do vertuously, since it befel her to supply the Nonage of her Son: 
else nothing more awry from the Law of God and Nature, then that a Woman 
should give Laws to Men.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Her Son Sisilius coming to Years, receiv'd the Rule; then in order 
Kimarus, then Danius or Elanius his Brother.  Then Morindus, his Son by 
Tanguestela a Concubine, who is recorded a Man of excessive Strength, 
Valiant, Liberal, and fair of Aspect, but immanely Cruel; not sparing in 
his Anger Enemy or Friend, if any Weapon were in his hand.  A certain 
King of the Morines, or Picards, invaded Northumberland; whose Army this 
King, though not wanting sufficient Numbers, chiefly by his own Prowess 
overcame: But dishonour'd his Victory by the cruel Usage of his 
Prisoners, whom his own hands, or others in his presence put all to 
several deaths: well fitted to such a bestial Cruelty was his end; for 
hearing of a huge Monster that from the ërish Sea infested the Coast, 
and in the pride of his Srength foolishly attempting to set manly Valour 
against a brute Vastness, when his Weapons were all in vain, by that 
horrible Mouth he was catch'd up and devour'd.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Gorbonian the eldest of his five Sons, then whom a juster Man 
liv'd not in his Age, was a great builder of Temples, and gave to all 
what was their due; to his Gods devout Worship, to Men of desert Honour 
and Preferment, to the Commons encouragement in their Labours and 
Trades, defence and protection from Injuries and Oppressions; so that 
the Land flourish'd above her Neighbours, Violence and Wrong seldom was 
heard of.  His Death was a general Loss: he was buried in Trinovant.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Archigallo the second Brother follow'd not his Example; but 
depress'd the ancient Nobility; and by peeling the wealthier sort, 
stuff'd his Treasury, and took the right way to be depos'd.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Elidure the next Brother, surnam'd the Pious, was set up in his 
place; a Mind so noble, and so moderate, as almost is incredible to have 
bin ever found.  For having held the Scepter five years, hunting one day 
in the Forest of Calater, he chanc'd to meet his deposed Brother, 
wandring in a mean condition; who had been long in vain beyond the Seas, 
importuning foreign Aids to his Restorement; and was now in a poor 
Habit, with only ten Followers, privately return'd to find Subsistence 
among his secret Friends.  At the unexpected sight of him, Elidure 
himself also then but thinly accompanied, runs to him with open Arms; 
and after many dear and sincere Welcomings, conveys him to the City 
Alclud; there hides him in his own Bedchamber.  Afterwards feigning 
himself sick, summons all his Peers as about greatest Affairs; where 
admitting them one by one, as if his Weakness endur'd not the 
disturbance of more at once, causes them, willing or unwilling, once 
more to swear Allegiance to Archigallo.  Whom after Reconciliation made 
on all sides, he leads to York; and from his own head, places the Crown 
on the head of his Brother.  Who thenceforth, Vice itself dissolving in 
him, and forgetting her firmest hold with the admiration of a Deed so 
Heroic, became a true converted Man; rul'd worthily ten Years, died, and 
was buried in Caerleir.  Thus was a Brother sav'd by a Brother, to whom 
love of a Crown, the thing that so often dazles, and vitiates mortal 
Men, for which thousands of nearest Blood have destroy'd each other, was 
in respect of brotherly Dearness, a contemptible thing.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Elidure now in his own behalf re-assumes the Government, and did 
as was worthy such a Man to do.  When Providence, that so great Vertue 
might want no sort of trial to make it more illustrious, stirs up 
Vigenius, and Peredure his youngest Brethren, against him who had 
deserved so nobly of that Relation, as least of all by a Brother to be 
injur'd.  Yet him they defeat, him they imprison in the Tower of 
Trinovant, and divide his Kingdom; the North to Peredure, the South to 
Vigenius.  After whose Death Peredure obtaining all, so much the better 
us'd his Power, by how much the worse he got it: so that Elidure now is 
hardly miss'd.  But yet in all right owing to his Elder the due place 
whereof he had depriv'd him, Fate would that he should die first: And 
Elidure after many years Imprisonment, is now the third time seated on 
the Throne; which at last he enjoy'd long in peace, finishing the 
interrupted Course of his mild and just Reign, as full of virtuous 
Deeds, as Days to his end.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">After these five Sons of Morindus, succeeded also their Sons in 
order.*  Regin of Gorbonian, Marganus of Archigallo, both good Kings.  
But Enniaunus his Brother taking other courses, was after six Years 
depos'd.  Then Idwallo taught by a near Example, govern'd soberly.  Then 
Runno, then Geruntius, He of Peredure, this last the Son of Elidure.  
From whose Loins (for that likely is the durable, and surviving Race 
that springs of just Progenitors) issu'd a long Descent of Kings, whose 
Names only for many Successions, without other memory, stand thus 
registr'd; Catellus, Coillus, Porrex, Cherin, and his three Sons, 
Felgenius, Eldadus, and Andradius, his Son Urianus; Eliud, Eledaucus, 
Clotenus, Gurguntius, Merianus, Bleduno, Capis, Oenus, Sisillius, twenty 
Kings in a continu'd row, that either did nothing, or liv'd in Ages that 
wrote nothing, at least a foul pretermission in the Author, of this, 
whether Story or Fable; himself weary, as seems, of his own tedious 
Tale.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">But to make amends for this Silence, Blegabredus next succeeding, 
is recorded to have excell'd all before him in the Art of Music; 
opportunely, had he but left us one Song of his 20 Predecessors doings.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Yet after him nine more succeeded in Name; His Brother 
Archimailus, Eldol, Redion, Rederchius, Samulius, Penissel, Pir, 
Capoirus; but Cleguellius, with the addition of Modest,Wise and Just.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">His Son Heli reign'd 40 Years, and had three Sons, Lud, 
Cassibelan, and Nennius.  This Heli seems to be the same whom Ninnius in 
his Fragment calls Minocan; for him he writes to be the Father of 
Cassibelan.  Lud was he who enlarg'd, and wall'd about Trinovant; there 
kept his Court, made it the prime City, and call'd it from his own Name 
Caer-Lud, or Lud's Town, now London.  Which, as is alledg'd out of 
Gildas, became matter of great dissension betwixt him, and his Brother 
Nennius; who took it heinously that the Name of Troy their ancient 
Country should be abolish'd for any new one.  Lud was hardy, and bold in 
War, in Peace a jolly Feaster.  He conquer'd many Islands of the Sea, 
saith Huntingdon, 4 and was buried by the Gate which from thence we call 
Ludgate.  His two Sons, Androgeus and Tenuantius, were left to the 
Tuition of Cassibelan; whose Bounty and high Demeanor so wrought with 
the common People, as got him easily the Kingdom transfer'd upon 
himself.  He nevertheless continuing to favour and support his Nephews, 
confers freely upon Androgeus, London with Kent; upon Tenuantius, 
Cornwal; reserving a Superiority both over them, and all the other 
Princes to himself, till the Romans for a while circumscribed his Power.  
Thus far, though leaning only on the Credit of Geffrey Monmouth, and his 
Assertors, I yet for the specify'd Causes have thought it not beneath my 
purpose, to relate what I found.  Whereto I neither oblige the Belief of 
other Person, nor over-hastily subscribe mine own.  Nor have I stood 
with others computing or collating Years and Chronologies, lest I should 
be vainly curious about the Time and Circumstance of things wherof the 
Substance is so much in doubt.  By this time, like one who had set out 
on his way by Night, and travel'd through a Region of smooth or idle 
Dreams, our History now arrives on the Confines, where Day-light and 
Truth meet us with a clear Dawn, representing to our view, though at a 
far distance, true Colours and Shapes.  For albeit C[ae]sar, whose 
Authority we are now first to follow, wanted not who taxed him of 
misreporting in his Commentaries, yea in his Civil War against Pompey, 
much more, may we think, in the British Affairs, of whose little skill 
in writing he did not easily hope to be contradicted; yet now in such 
variety of good Authors, we hardly can miss, from one hand or other, to 
be sufficiently inform'd as of things past so long ago.  But this will 
better be referr'd to a second Discourse.

THE 

H I S T O R Y

OF

B R I T A I N.

------------------------------------------------------------
THE SECOND BOOK.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am now to write of what befel the Britains from fifty and three years 
before the Birth of our Saviour, when first the Romans came in, till the 
decay and ceasing of that Empire; a Story of much Truth, and for the 
first hundred years and somewhat more, collected without much labour.  
So many and so prudent were the Writers, which those two, the civilest 
and the wisest of European Nations, both Italy and Greece, afforded to 
the Actions of that puissant City.  For worthy Deeds are not often 
destitute of worthy Relaters: as by a certain Fate great Acts and great 
Eloquence have most commonly gone hand in hand, equalling and honouring 
each other in the same Ages.  'Tis true, that in obscurest Times, by 
shallow and unskilful Writers, the indistinct Noise of many Battels, and 
Devastations of many Kingdoms over-run and lost, hath come to our ears.  
For what wonder, if in all Ages Amtition and the love of Rapine hath 
stirr'd up greedy and violent Men to bold Attempts in wasting and 
ruining Wars, which to Posterity have left the Work of wild Beasts and 
Destroyers, rather then the Deeds and Monuments of Men and Conquerors?  
But he whose just and true Valour uses the necessity of War and Dominion 
not to destroy, but to prevent Destruction, to bring in Liberty against 
Tyrants, Law and Civility among barbarous Nations, knowing that when he 
conquers all things else, he cannot conquer Time or Detraction, wisely 
conscious of this his want as well as of his Wroth not to be forgotten 
or conceal'd, honours and hath recourse to the Aid of Eloquence, his 
friendliest and best Supply; by whose immortal Record his noble Deeds, 
which else were transitory, become fixt and durable againt the Force of 
Years and Generations, he fails not to continue through all Posterity, 
over Envy, Death, and Time, also victorious.  Therfore when the Esteem 
of Science and liberal Study waxes low in the Commonwealth, we may 
presume that also there all civil Virtue, and worthy Action is grown as 
low to a decline: and then Eloquence as it were consorted in the same 
Destiny, with the decrease and fall of Vertue, corrupts also and fades; 
at least resigns her Office of relating to illiterate and frivolous 
Historians, such as the Persons themselves both deserve, and are best 
pleas'd with; whilst they want either the understanding to choose 
better, or the Innocence to dare invite the examining, and searching 
Stile of an intelligent and faithful Writer to the Survey of their 
unsound Exploits, better befriended by Obscurity then Fame.  As for 
these, the only Authors we have of British Matters, while the Power of 
Rome reach'd hither, (for Gildas affirms that of the Roman times no 
British Writer was in his days extant, or if any ever were, either burnt 
by Enemies, or transported with such as fled the Pictish and Saxon 
Invasions) these therfore only Roman Authors there be, who in the 
English Tongue have laid together as much, and perhaps more then was 
requisite to a History of Britain.  So that were it not for leaving an 
unsightly gap so near to the beginning, I should have judg'd this 
Labour, wherein so little seems to be requir'd above Transcription, 
almost superfluous.  Notwithstanding since I must through it, if ought 
by Diligence may be added or omitted, or by other disposing may be more 
explain'd, or more express'd, I shall assay.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Julius C[ae]sar (of whom, and of the Roman free State, more then what 
appertains, is not here to be discours'd) having subdu'd most part of 
Gallia, which by a Potent Faction he had obtain'd of the Senate as his 
Province for many years, stirr'd up with a desire of adding still more 
Glory to his Name, and the whole Roman Empire to his Ambition; some 
say,1. with a far meaner and ignobler, the Desire of British Pearls, 
whose bigness he delighted to ballance in his hand, determins, and that 
upon no unjust pretended occasion, to try his Force in the Conquest also 
of Britain.  For he understood that the Britains in most of his Gallian 
Wars had sent Supplies against him; had receiv'd Fugitives of the 
Bellovaci his Enemies; and were call'd over to aid the Cities of 
Armorica, which had the year before conspir'd all in a new Rebellion.  
Therefore C[ae]sar, though now the Summer well nigh ending,2. and the 
Season unagreeable to transport a War, yet judg'd it would be great 
Advantage, only to get entrance into the Isle, Knowledge of the Men, the 
Places, the Ports, the Accesses; which then, it seems, were even to the 
Gauls our Neighbours almost unknown.  For except Merchants and Traders, 
it is not oft, saith he, that any use to travel thither; and to those 
that do, besides the Sea-Coast, and the Ports next to Gallia, nothing 
else is known. 3. But here I must require, as Pollio did, the Diligence, 
at least the Memory of C[ae]sar: For if it were true, as they of Rhemes 
told him, 4. that Divitiachus, not long before a puissant King of the 
Soissons, had Britain also under his Command, besides the Belgian 
Colonies which he affirms to have nam'd, and peopled many Provinces 
there; if also the Britains had so frequently given them aid in all 
their Wars; if lastly, the Druid Learning honour'd so much among them, 
were first tuaght them out of Britain, and they who soonest would attain 
that Disciplin, sent hither to learn;5. it appears not how Britain at 
that time should be so utterly unknown in Gallia, or only known to 
Merchants, yea to them so little, that being call'd together from all 
parts, none could be found to inform C[ae]sar of what bigness the Isle, 
what Nations, how great, what use of War they had, what Laws, or so much 
as what commodious Havens for bigger Vessels.  Of all which things as it 
were then first to make discovery, he sends Caius Volusenus, in a long 
Galley, with command to return as soon as this could be effected.  He in 
the mean time with his whole Power draws nigh to the Morine Coast, 
whence the shortest Passage was into Britain.  Hither his Navy, which he 
us'd against the Armoricans, and what else of Shipping can be provided, 
he draws together.  This known in Britain, Embassadors are sent from 
many of the States there, who promise Hostages and Obedience to the 
Roman Empire.  Them, after Audience given, C[ae]sar as largely promising 
and exhorting to continue in that mind, sends home, and with them Comius 
of Arras, whom he had made King of that Country, and now secretly 
employ'd to gain a Roman Party among the Britains, in as many Cities as 
he found inclinable, and to tell them, that he himself was speeding 
thither.  Volusenus with what Discovery of the Island he could make from 
aboard his Ship, not daring to venture on the shore, within five days 
returns to C[ae]sar.  Who soon after, with two Legions, ordinarily 
amounting, of Romans and their Allies, to about 25000 Foot, and 4500 
Horse, the Foot in 80 Ships of Burden, the Horse in 18, besides what 
Galleys were appointed for his chief Commanders, sets off, about the 
third Watch of Night, with a good Gale to Sea; leaving behind him 
Sulpitius Rufus to make good the Port with a sufficient Strength.  But 
the Horse, whose appointed Shipping lay wind-bound, 8 Mile upward in 
another Haven, had much trouble to imbark.  C[ae]sar now within sight of 
Britain, beholds on every Hill multitudes of armed Men ready to forbid 
his Landing; and Cicero writes to his Friend Atticus, 6. that the 
Accesses of the Island were wondrously fortify'd with strong Works or 
Moles.  Here from the fourth to the ninth Hour of the Day he awaits at 
Anchor the coming up of his whole Fleet.  Mean while, with his Legats 
and Tribunes, consulting and giving order to fit all things for what 
might happen is such a various and floating Water-fight as was to be 
expected.  This place, which was a narrow Bay, close environ'd with 
Hills, appearing no way commodious, he removes to  plain and open shore 
8 Mile distant; commonly suppos'd about Deal in Kent. 7. Which when the 
Britains perceiv'd, their Horse and Chariots, as then they us'd in 
fight, scowring before, their main Power speeding after, some thick upon 
the shore, others not tarrying to be assail'd, ride in among the waves 
to encounter, and assault the Romans even under their Ships, with such a 
bold and free Hardihood, that C[ae]sar himself between confessing and 
excusing that his Soldiers were to come down from their Ships, to stand 
in water heavy arm'd, and to fight at once, denies not but that the 
Terror of such new and resolute Opposition made them forget their wonted 
Valour.  To succour which he commands his Galleys, a sight unusual to 
the Britains, and more apt for Motion, drawn from the bigger Vessels, to 
row against the open side of the Enemy, and thence with Slings, Engines 
and Darts, to beat them back.  But neither yet, though amaz'd at the 
strangeness of those new Sea-Castles, bearing up so near, and so swiftly 
as almost to over-whelm them, the hurtling of Oars, the battering of 
fierce Engines against their Bodies barely expos'd, did the Britains 
give much ground, or the Romans gain; till he who bore the Eagle of the 
tenth Legion, yet in the Galleys, first beseeching his Gods, said thus 
aloud, Leap down Soldiers, unless you mean to betray your Ensign; I for 
my part will perform what I owe to the Commonwealth and my General.  
This utter'd, over-board he leaps, and with his Eagle fiercely advanc'd 
runs upon the Enemy; the rest heartning one another not to admit the 
Dishonour of so nigh losing their chief Standard, follow him resolutely.  
Now was fought eagerly on both sides.  Ours who well knew their own 
Advantages, and expertly us'd them, now in the Shallows, now on the 
Sand, still as the Romans went trooping to their Ensigns, receiv'd them, 
dispatch'd them, and with the help of their Horse, put them every where 
to great disorder.  But C[ae]sar causing all his Boats and Shallops to be 
fill'd with Soldiers, commanded to ply up and down continually with 
Relief where they saw need; wherby at length all the Foot now dis-
imbark'd, and got together in some order on firm ground, with a more 
steddy charge put the Britains to flight: but wanting all their Horse, 
whom the Winds yet with-held from sailing, they were not able to make 
pursuit.  In this confused Fight, 8. Sc[ae]va a Roman Soldier having 
press'd too far among the Britains, and beset round, after incredible 
Valour shewn, single against a multitude, swam back safe to his General; 
and in the place that rung with his Praises, earnestly besought Pardon 
for his rash Advanture against Discipline: which modest confessing after 
no bad Event, for such a Deed wherein Valour and Ingenuity so much 
outweigh'd Transgression, easily made amends and preferr'd him to be a 
Centurion.  C[ae]sar also is brought in by Julian, attributing to himself 
the Honour (if it were at all an Honour to that Person which he 
sustain'd) of being the first that left his Ship, and took Land: but 
this were to make C[ae]sar less understand what became his then Sc[ae]va.  The 
Britains finding themselves master'd in fight, forthwith send 
Embassadors to treat of Peace, promising to give Hostages, and to be at 
Command.  With them Comius of Arras also return'd; whom hitherto since 
his first coming from C[ae]sar, they had detain'd in Prison as  Spy: the 
blame wherof they lay on the common People; for whose Violence and their 
own Imprudence they crave pardon.  C[ae]sar complaining they had first 
sought Peace, and then without cause had begun War, yet content to 
pardon them, commands Hostages: wherof part they bring in strait, others 
far up in the country to be sent for, they promise in a few days.  Mean 
while the People disbanded and sent home, many Princes and chief Men 
from all parts of the Isle submit themselves and their Cities to the 
dispose of C[ae]sar, who lay then encamp'd, as is thought on Baram-down.  
Thus had the Britains made their Peace; when suddenly an Accident 
unlook'd for put new Counsels into their Minds.  Four days after the 
coming of C[ae]sar, those 18 Ships of burden, which from the upper Haven 
had taken in all the Roman Horse, born with a soft Wind to the very 
Coast, in sight of the Roman Camp, were by a sudden Tempest scatter'd 
and driven back, some to the Port from whence they loos'd, others down 
into the West Country; who finding there no Safety either to land or to 
cast Anchor, chose rather to commit themselves again to the troubled 
Sea; and, as Orosius reports, were most of them cast away.  The same 
Night, it being full Moon, the Galleys left upon dry Land, were, unaware 
to the Romans, cover'd with a Spring-tide, and the greater Ships, that 
lay off at Anchor, torn and beaten with Waves, to the great perplexity 
of C[ae]sar, and his whole Army; who now had neither Shipping left to 
convey them back, nor any provision made to stay here, intending to have 
winter'd in Gallia.  All this the Britains well perceiving, and by the 
Compass of his Camp, which without Baggage appear'd the smaller, 
guessing at his Numbers, consult together, and one by one slily 
withdrawing from the Camp, where they were waiting the conclusion of a 
Peace, resolve to stop all Provisions, and to draw out the Business till 
Winter.  C[ae]sar, though ignorant of what they intended, yet from the 
condition wherin he was, and their other Hostages not sent, suspecting 
what was likely, begins to provide apace, all that might be, against 
what might happen; lays in Corn, and with Materials fetch'd from the 
Continent, and what was left of those Ships which were past help, he 
repairs the rest.  So that now by the incessant Labour of his Soldiers, 
all but twelve were again made serviceable.  While these things are 
doing, one of the Legions being sent out to forage, as was accustom'd, 
and no suspicion of War, while some of the Britains were remaining in 
the country about, others also going and coming freely to the Romans 
Quarters, they who were in station at the Camp Gates sent speedy word to 
C[ae]sar, that from that part of the country, to which the Legion went, a 
greater Dust then usual was seen to rise.  C[ae]sar guessing the matter, 
commands the Cohorts of Guard to follow him thither, two others to 
succeed in their stead, the rest all to arm and follow.  They had not 
march'd long, when C[ae]sar discerns his Legion sore over-charg'd: for the 
Britains not doubting but that their Enemies on the morrow would be in 
that place which only they had left unreap'd of all their Harvest, had 
plac'd an Ambush; and while they were disperst and busiest at their 
Labour, set upon them, kill'd some, and routed the rest.  The manner of 
their fight was from a kind of Chariots; wherin riding about, and 
throwing Darts, with the clutter of their Horse, and of their Wheels, 
they oft-times broke the Rank of their Enemies; then retreating among 
the Horse and quitting their Chariots, they fought on foot.  The 
Charioteers in the mean while somewhat aside from the Battel, set 
themselves in such order, that their Masters at any time oppress'd with 
odds, might retire safely thither, having perform'd with one Person both 
the nimble Service of a Horse-man, and the stedfast Duty of a Foot-
Soldier.  So much they could with their Chariots by use and exercise, as 
riding on the speed down a steep Hill, to stop suddenly, and with a 
short rein turn swiftly, now running on the Beam, now on the Yoke, then 
in the Seat.  With this sort of new skirmishing the Romans now over-
match'd and terrify'd, C[ae]sar with opportune Aid appears; for then the 
Britains make a stand: but he considering that now was not fit time to 
offer Battel, while his Men were scarce recovered of so late a fear, 
only keeps his ground, and soon after leads back his Legions to the 
Camp.  Further Action for many days following was hinder'd on both sides 
by foul Weather; in which time the Britains dispatching Messengers round 
about, to how few the Romans were reduced, what hope of Praise and 
Booty, and now, if ever, of freeing themselves from the fear of like 
Invasions herafter, by making these an example, if they could but now 
uncamp their Enemies; at this intimation multitudes of Horse and Foot 
coming down from all parts, make towards the Romans.  C[ae]sar foreseeing 
that the Britains, tho' beaten and put to flight, would easily evade his 
Foot, yet with no more then 30 Horse, which Comius had brought over, 
draws out his Men to battel, puts again the Britains to flight, pursues 
with slaughter, and returning burns and lays waste all about.  Whereupon 
Embassadors the same day being sent from the Britains to desire Peace, 
C[ae]sar as his Affairs at present stood, for so great a Breach of Faith, 
only imposes on them double the former Hostages, to be sent after him 
into Gallia: And because September was nigh half spent, a Season not fit 
to tempt the Sea with his weather-beaten Fleet, the same night with a 
fair Wind he departs towards Belgia; whether two only of the Britain 
Cities sent Hostages, as they promis'd, the rest neglected.  But at Rome 
when the News came of C[ae]sar's Acts here, whether it were esteem'd a 
Conquest or a fair Escape, Supplication of twenty days is decreed by the 
Senate, as either for an Exploit done, or a Discovery made, wherin both 
C[ae]sar and the Romans gloried not a little, though it brought not benefit 
either to him, or to the Commonwealth.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The Winter following, 9. C[ae]sar, as his Custom was, going into 
Italy, whenas he saw that most of the Britains regarded not to send 
their Hostages, appoints his Legates whom he left in Belgia, to provide 
what possible Shipping they could either build, or repair.  Low built 
they were to be, as therby easier both to fraught, and to hale ashore; 
nor needed to be higher, because the Tide so often changing, was 
observ'd to make the Billows less in our Sea then those in the 
Mediterranean: broader likewise they were made, for the better 
transporting of Horses, and all other fraughtage, being intended chiefly 
to that end.  These all about 600 in a readiness, with 28 Ships of 
burden, and what with Adventurers, and other Hulks above 200, Cotta one 
of the Legates wrote them, as Athen[ae]us affirms, in all 1000; C[ae]sar from 
Port Iccius, a Passage of some 30 mile over, leaving behind him Labienus 
to guard the Haven, and for other supply at need, with five Legions, 
though but 2000 Horse, about Sunset hoysing sail with a slack South-
West, at midnight was becalm'd.  And finding when it was light, that the 
whole Navy lying on the Current, had fallen off from the Isle, which now 
they could descry on their left hand, by the unwearied labour of his 
Soldiers, who refus'd not to tug the Oar, and kept course with Ships 
under sail, he bore up as near as might be, to the same place where he 
had landed the year before; where about Noon arriving, no Enemy could be 
seen. 10. For the Britains, which in great number, as was after known, 
had been there, at sight of so huge a Fleet durst not abide.  C[ae]sar 
forthwith landing his Army, and encamping to his best advantage, some 
notice being given him by those he took, where to find his Enemy, with 
the whole Power, save only ten Cohorts, and 300 Horse, left to Quintus 
Atrius for the guard of his Ships, about the third watch of the same 
night, marches up twelve Mile into the Country.  And at length by a 
River, commonly thought the Stowre in Kent, espies embattail'd the 
British Forces.  They with their Horses and Chariots advancing to the 
higher Banks, oppose the Romans in their March, and begin the Fight; but 
repuls'd by the Roman Cavalry, give back into the Woods to a place 
notably made strong both by Art and Nature; which, it seems, had been a 
Fort, or Hold of strength rais'd heretofore in time of Wars among 
themselves.  For entrance, and access on all sides, by the felling of 
huge Trees overthwart one another, was quite barr'd up; and within these 
the Britains did their utmost to keep out the Enemy.  But the Soldiers 
of the seventh Legion locking all their Shields together like a Roof 
close over head, and others raising a Mount, without much loss of Blood 
took the Place, and drove them all to forsake the Woods.  Pursuit they 
made not long, as being through ways unknown, and now Evening came on, 
which they more wisely spent, in choosing out where to pitch and fortify 
their Camp that Night.  The next Morning C[ae]sar had but newly sent out 
his men in three Bodies to pursue, and the last no further gone then yet 
in sight, when Horsemen all in post from Quintus Atrius bring word to 
C[ae]sar, that almost all his Ships in a Tempest that Night had suffer'd 
wreck, and lay broken upon the shore.  C[ae]sar at this news recalls his 
Legions, himself in all haste riding back to the Sea-side, beheld with 
his Eyes the ruinous Prospect.  About forty Vessels were sunk and lost, 
the residue so torn and shaken, as not to be new-rigg'd without much 
Labour.  Strait he assembles what number of Ship-wrights either in his 
own Legions or from beyond Sea could be summon'd; appoints Labienus on 
the Belgian side to build more; and with a dreadful industry of ten 
days, not respiting the Soldiers day or night, drew up all his Ships, 
and entrench'd them round within the circuit of his Camp.  This done, 
and leaving to their defence the same Strength as before, he returns 
with his whole Forces to the same Wood, where he had defeated the 
Britains; who preventing him with greater Powers then before, had now 
repossess'd themselves of that place, under Cassibelan their chief 
Leader: whose Territory from the States bordering on the Sea was divided 
by the River Thames about 80 mile inward.  With him formerly other 
Cities had continual War; but now in the common danger had all made 
choice of him to be their General.  Here the British Horse and 
Charioteers meeting with the Roman Cavalry, fought stoutly; and at 
first, something overmatch'd they retreat to the near advantage of their 
Woods and Hills, but still follow'd by the Romans, make head again, cut 
off the forwardest among them, and after some pause, while C[ae]sar, who 
thought the day's work had been done, was busied about the entrenching 
of his Camp, march out again, give fierce Assault to the very Stations 
of his Guards and Senteries; and while the main Cohorts of two Legions 
that were sent to the Alarm, stood within a small distance of each 
other, terrify'd at  the newness and boldness of their fight, charg'd 
back again through the midst, without loss of a man.  Of the Romans that 
day was slain Quintus Laberius Durus a Tribune; the Britains having 
fought their fill at the very entrance of C[ae]sar's Camp, and sustain'd 
the resistance of his whole Army entrench'd, gave over the Assault.  
C[ae]sar here acknowledges that the Roman way both of arming, and of 
fighting, was not so well fitted against this kind of Enemy; for that 
the Foot in heavy Armour could not follow their cunning flight, and 
durst not by ancient Discipline stir from their Ensign; and the Horse 
alone disjoin'd from the Legions, against a Foe that turn'd suddenly 
upon them with a mixt encounter both of Horse and Foot, were in equal 
danger both following and retiring.  Besides their Fashion was, not in 
great Bodies, and close Order, but in small Divisions and open Distances 
to make their onset; appointing others at certain spaces, now to relieve 
and bring off the weary, now to succeed and renew the Conflict; which 
argu'd not small experience, and use of Arms.  Next day the Britains 
afar off upon the Hills begin to shew themselves here and there, and 
though less boldly then before, to skirmish with the Roman Horse.  But 
at Noon C[ae]sar having sent out three Legions, and all his Horse, with 
Trebonius the Legate, to seek Fodder, suddenly on all sides they set 
upon the Foragers, and change up after them to the very Legions, and 
their Standards.  The Romans with great Courage beat them back, and in 
the Chace, being well seconded by the Legions, not giving them time 
either to rally, to stand, or to descend from their Chariots as they 
were wont, slew many.  From this overthrow, the Britains that dwelt 
farther off, betook them home; and came no more after that time with so 
great a Power against C[ae]sar.  Wherof advertis'd he marches onward to the 
Frontiers of Cassibelan, which on this side were bounded by the Thames, 
not passable except in one place and that difficult, about Coway-stakes 
near Oatlands, as in conjectur'd. 11. Hither coming he descries on the 
other side great Forces of the Enemy, plac'd in good Array; the Bank set 
all with sharp Stakes, others in the Bottom, cover'd with Water; wherof 
the Marks in Beda's time, were to be seen, as he relates.  This having 
learnt by such as were taken, or had run to him, he first commands his 
Horse to pass over; then his Foot, who wading up to the Neck, went on so 
resolutely and so fast, that they on the further side not enduring the 
Violence, retreated and fled.  Cassibelan no more now in hope to contend 
for Victory, dismissing all but 4000 of those Charioteers, through Woods 
and intricate Ways attends their Motion; where the Romans are to pass, 
drives all before him; and with continual Sallies upon the Horse, where 
they least expected, cutting off some and terrifying others, compels 
them so close together, as gave them no leave to fetch in prey or booty 
without ill success.  Wherupon C[ae]sar strictly commanding all not to part 
from the Legions, had nothing left him in his way but empty Fields 
andHouses, which he spoil'd and burnt.  Mean while the Trinobantes, a 
State or Kingdom, and perhaps the greatest then among the Britains, less 
favouring Cassibelan, send Embassadors, and yield to C[ae]sar upon this 
reason.  Immanuentius had been their King: him Cassibelan had slain, and 
purpos'd the like to Mandubratius his Son, whom Orosius calls 
Androgorius, Beda Androgius; but the youth escaping by flight into 
Gallia, put himself under the protection of C[ae]sar.  These entreat that 
Mandubratius may be still defended, and sent home to succeed in his 
Father's right.  C[ae]sar sends him, demands 40 Hostages and Provision for 
his Army, which they immediately bring in, and have their Confines 
protected from the Soldiers.  By their Example the Cenimagni, 
Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, Cassi (so I write them, for the modern 
names are but guess'd) on like terms make their Peace.  By them he 
learns that the Town of Cassibelan, suppos'd to be Verulam, was not far 
distant; fenc'd about with Woods and Marshes, well stuff'd with Men and 
much Cattel.  For Towns then in Britain were only woody places ditch'd 
round, and with a Mud Wall encompass'd against the inroads of Enemies.  
Thither goes C[ae]sar with his Legions, and though a place of great 
Strength both by Art and Nature, assaults it in two places.  The 
Britains after some defence fled out all at another end of the Town; in 
the flight many were taken, many slain, and great store of Cattel found 
there.  Cassibelan for all these Losses yet deserts not himself; nor was 
yet his Authority so much impair'd, but that in Kent, though in a manner 
possest by the Enemy, his Messengers and Commands find obedience enough 
to raise all the People.  By his direction, Cingetorix, Carvillus, 
Taximagulus and Segonax, four Kings reigning in those Countries which 
lie upon the Sea, lead them on to assault that Camp wherin the Romans 
had entrench'd their Shipping: but they whom C[ae]sar left there, issuing, 
out, slew many, and took Prisoners Cingetorix  a noted Leader, without 
loss of their own.  Cassibelan after so many defeats, mov'd especially 
by revolt of the Cities from him, their inconstancy and falshood one to 
another, uses mediation by Comius of Arras to send Embassadors about 
Treaty of yielding.  C[ae]sar who had determin'd to winter in the 
Continent, by reason that Gallia was unsettled, and not much of the 
Summer now behind, commands him only Hostages, and what yearly Tribute 
the Island should pay to Rome, forbids him to molest the Trinobants, or 
Mandubratius; and with his Hostages, and a great number of Captives he 
puts to Sea, having at twice embark'd him whole Army. 12. At his return 
to Rome, as from a glorious Enterprize, he offers to Venus the Patroness 
of his Family, a Corslet of British Pearls.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Howbeit other ancient Writers have spoken more doubtfully of 
C[ae]sar's Victories here; and that in plain Terms he fled from hence; for 
which the common Verse in Lucan, with divers Passages here and there in 
Tacitus, is alledg'd.  Paulus Orosius, who took what he wrote from a 
History of Suetonius now lost, 13. writes that C[ae]sar in his first 
journey entertain'd with a sharp Fight, lost no small number of his 
Foot, and by Tempest nigh all his Horse.  Dion affirms that once in the 
second Expedition all his Foot were routed; Orosius that another time 
all Horse.  The British Author, whom I use only then when others are all 
silent, hath many trivial discourses of C[ae]sar's being here, which are 
best omitted.  Nor have we more of Cassibelan, then what the same Story 
tells, how he warr'd soon after with Androgeus, about his Nephew slain 
by Evelinus Nephew to the other; which business at length compos'd, 
Cassibelan dies, and was buried in York, if the Monmouth Book fable not.  
But at C[ae]sar's coming hither, such likeliest were the Britains, as the 
Writers of those times, and their own actions represent them; in courage 
and warlike readiness to take advantage by Ambush or sudden Onset, not 
inferior to the Romans, nor Cassibelan to C[ae]sar; in Weapons, Arms, and 
the skill of Encamping, Embattailing, Fortifying, overmatch'd; 14. their 
Weapons were a short Spear and light Target, a Sword also by their side, 
their fight sometimes in Chariots phang'd at the Axle with Iron Sithes, 
their Bodies most part naked, only painted with woad in sundry Figures, 
to seem terrible, as they thought, 15. but pursu'd by Enemies, not nice 
of their painting to run into Bogs, worse then wild Irish up to the 
Neck, and there to stay many days holding a certain Morsel in their 
Mouths no bigger then a Bean, to suffice hunger;16. but that receipt, 
and the Temperance it taught, is long since unknown among us: their 
Towns and Strong-holds were spaces of ground fenc'd about with a Ditch 
and great Trees fell'd overthwart each other,17. their Buildings within 
were thatch'd Houses for themselves and their Cattle:18. in peace the 
Upland Inhabitants besides Hunting, tended their Flocks and Herds, but 
with little skill of Country Affairs; the making of Cheese they commonly 
knew not, Wool or Flax they spun not, Gardening and Planting many of 
them knew not; Clothing they had none, but what the Skins of Beasts 
afforded them, and that not always;19. yet gallantry they had, painting 
their own Skins with several Portraitures of Beast, Bird, or Flower,20. 
A Vanity which hath not yet left us, remov'd only from the skin to the 
skirt behung now with as many colour'd Ribands and Gew-gawes:21. towards 
the Sea-side they till'd the Ground, and liv'd much after the manner of 
Gauls their Neighbours, or first Planters: their Money was brazen pieces 
or Iron Rings, their best Merchandize Tin, the rest Trifles of Glass, 
Ivory,and such like;22. yet Gems and Pearls they had, saith Mela, in 
some Rivers:23. their Ships of light timber wicker'd with Oysier 
between, and cover'd over with Leather, serv'd not therfore to transport 
them far, and their Commodities were fetch'd away by foreign Merchants: 
their dealing, saith Diodorus,24. plain and simple without fraud; their 
Civil Government under many Princes and States, not confederate or 
consulting in common, but mistrustful, and oft-times warring one with 
the other,25. which gave them up one by one an easy Conquest to the 
Romans: their Religion was govern'd by a sort of Priests or Magicians, 
called Druides from the Greek Name of an Oak, which Tree they had in 
great reverence, and the Mistleto especially growing theron.  Pliny 
writes them skill'd in Magic no less then those of Persia: by their 
abstaining from a Hen, a Hare and a Goose, from Fish also, saith Dion, 
and their Opinion of the Soul's passing after death into other Bodies, 
they may be thought to have studied Pythagoras;26. yet Philosophers I 
cannot call them, reported Men factious and ambitious, contending 
sometimes about the Archpriesthood not without Civil War and 
Slaughter;27. nor restrain'd they the People under them from a leud, 
adulterous and incestuous Life, ten or twelve Men absurdly against 
Nature, possessing one Woman as their common Wife, though of nearest 
kin, Mother, Daughter or Sister; Progenitors not to be gloried in.  But 
the Gospel, not long after preach'd here, abolish'd such Impurities, and 
of the Romans we have cause not to say much worse, then that they beat 
us into some Civility; likely else to have continu'd longer in a 
barbarous and savage manner of Life.  After Julius (for Julius before 
his Death tyrannously had made himself Emperor of the Roman 
Commonwealth, and was slain in the Senate for so doing) he who next 
obtain'd the Empire, Octavius C[ae]sar Augustus, either contemning the 
Island, as Strabo would have us think,28. whose neither Benefit was 
worth the having, nor Enmity worth the fearing; or out of a wholesom 
State-Maxim, as some say, to moderate and bound the Empire from growing 
vast and unwieldy, make no attempt against the Britains.  But the truer 
Cause was partly civil War among the Romans, partly other Affairs more 
urging.  For about 20 Years after, all which time the Britains had liv'd 
at their own dispose, Augustus in imitation of his Uncle Julius, either 
intending or seeming to intend an Expedition hither, was come into 
Gallia, 29. when the news of a Revolt in Pannonia diverted him:30. about 
seven years after in the same Resolution,31. what with the unsettledness 
of Gallia, and what with Embassadors from Britain which met him there, 
he proceeded not.  The next year, difference arising about Covenants, he 
was again prevented by other new Commotions in Spain. 32. Nevertheless 
some of the British Potentates omitted not to seek his friendship by 
Gifts offer'd in the Capitol, and other obsequious Addresses.  Insomuch 
that the whole Island became even in those days well known to the 
Romans;33. too well perhaps for them, who from the knowledge of us were 
so like to prove Enemies.  But as for Tribute, the Britains paid none to 
Augustus, except what easy Customs were levied on the slight Commodities 
wherewith they traded into Gallia.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">After Cassibelan, Tenantius the younger Son of Lud, according to 
the Monmouth Story, was made King.  For Androgeus the elder, conceiving 
himself generally hated for siding with the Romans, forsook his Claim 
here, and follow'd C[ae]sar's Fortune.  This King is recorded Just and 
Warlike.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">His Son Kymbeline or Cunobeline succeeding, was brought up, as is 
said, in the court of Augustus, and with him held friendly 
Correspondences to the end; was a warlike Prince, his chief Seat 
Camalodonum, or Maldon, as by certain of his Coins, yet to be seen 
appears.  Tiberius the next Emperor, adhering always to the Advice of 
Augustus,  and of himself less caring to extend the Bounds of his 
Empire, sought not the Britains; and they as little to incite him, sent 
home courteously the Soldiers of Germanicus, that by shipwreck had been 
cast on the Britain shore.34.  But Caligula his Successor, a wild and 
dissolute Tyrant, having past the Alps with intent to rob and spoil 
those Provinces, and stir'd up by Adminius the Son of Cunobeline; 35. 
who, by his Father banish'd, with a small number fled thither to him, 
made semblance of marching toward Britain; but being come to the Ocean, 
and there behaving himself madly and ridiculously, went back the same 
way:36. yet sent before him boasting Letters to the Senate, as if all 
Britain had been yielded him.  Cunobeline now dead,37. Adminius the 
eldest by his Father banish'd from his Country, and by his own practice 
against it from the Crown, though by an old Coin seeming to have also 
reign'd; Togodumnus, and Caractacus the two younger, uncertain whether 
unequal or subordinate in Power, were advanc'd into his place.  But 
through civil discord, Bericus 38. (what he was further, is not known) 
with others of his Party flying to Rome, persuaded Claudius the Emperor 
to an Invasion.  Claudius now Consul the third time,39. and desirous to 
do something, whence he might gain the honour of a Triumph, at the 
persuasion of these Fugitives, whom the Britains demanding, he had 
deny'd to render, and they for that cause had deny'd further Amity with 
Rome, makes choice of this Island for his Province: and sends before him 
Aulus Plautius the Pr[ae]tor, with this command, if the business grew 
difficult to give him notice.  Plautius with much ado persuaded the 
Legions to move out of Gallia, murmuring that now they must be put to 
make War beyond the World's end, for so they counted Britain; and what 
welcome Julius the Dictator found there, doubtless they had heard.  At 
last prevail'd with, and hoisting sail from three several Ports, lest 
their landing should in any one place be resisted, meeting cross Winds, 
they were cast back and disheartned: till in the night a meteor shooting 
flames from the East, and, as they fancy'd, directing their course, they 
took heart again to try the Sea, and without opposition landed.  For the 
Britains having heard of their unwillingness to come, had been negligent 
to provide against them; and retiring to the Woods and Moors, intended 
to frustrate and wear them out with delays, as they had serv'd C[ae]sar 
before.  Plautius after much trouble to find them out, encountring first 
with Caractacus, the with Togodumnus, overthrew them; and receiving into 
conditions part of the Boduni, who then were subject to the Catuellani, 
and leaving there a Garrison, went on toward a River; where the Britains 
not imagining that Plautius without a Bridge could pass, lay on the 
further side careless and secure.  But he sending first the Germans, 
whose Custom was, arm'd as they were, to swim with ease the strongest 
Current, commands them to strike especially at the Horses, wherby the 
Chariots,wherin consisted their chief art of fight, became 
unserviceable.  To second them he sent Vespasian, who in his latter days 
obtain'd the Empire, and Sabinus his Brother; who unexpectedly assailing 
those who were least aware, did much execution.  Yet not for this were 
the Britains dismay'd; but re-uniting the next day, fought with such a 
Courage, as made it hard to decide which way hung the victory: till 
Caius Sidius Geta, at point to have been taken, recover'd himself so 
valiantly, as brought the day on his side; for which at Rome he receiv'd 
high Honours.  After this the Britains drew back toward the mouth of 
Thames, and acquainted with those places, cross'd over; where the Romans 
following them through Bogs and dangerous Flats, hazarded the Loss of 
all.  Yet the Germans getting over, and others by a Bridge at some place 
above, fell on them again with sundry Alarms and great Slaughter; but in 
the heat of pursuit running themselves again into Bogs and Mires, lost 
as many of their own.  Upon which ill success, and seeing the Britains 
more enraged at the Death of Togodumnus, who in one of these Battels had 
been slain, Plautius fearing the worst, and glad that he could hold what 
he held, as was enjoin'd him, sends to Claudius.  He who waited ready 
with a huge Preparation, as if not safe enough amidst the flower of all 
his Romans, like a great Eastern King, with armed Elephants marches 
through Gallia.  So full of peril was this Enterprize esteem'd, as not 
without all this Equipage, and stranger Terrors then Roman Armies to 
meet the native and the naked British Valour defending their Country.  
Join'd with Plautius, who encamping on the Bank of Thames attended him, 
he passes the River.  The Britains, who had the Courage, but not the 
wise conduct of old Cassibelan, laying all Stratagem aside, in downright 
Manhood scrupled not to affront in open field almost the whole Power of 
the Roman Empire.  But overcome and vanquish'd, part by Force, others by 
Treaty come in and yield.  Claudius therfore who took Camalodunum, the 
Royal Seat of Cunobeline, was often by the Army saluted Imperator; a 
Military Title which usually they gave their General after any notable 
Exploit; but to others not above once in the same War; as if Claudius by 
these Acts had deserv'd more then the Laws of Rome had provided honour 
to reward.  Having therfore disarm'd the Britains,40. but remitted the 
Confiscation of their Goods, for which they worship'd him with Sacrifice 
and Temple as a God,41. leaving Plautius to subdue what remain'd; he 
returns to Rome, from whence he had been absent only six Months, and in 
Britain but sixteen days; sending the News before him of his Victories, 
though in a small part of the Island.  By which is manifestly refuted 
that which Eutropius and Orosius write of his conquering at that time 
also the Orcades Islands lying to the North of Scotland; and not 
conquer'd by the Romans (for ought found in any good Author) till above 
forty years after, as shall appear.  To Claudius the Senate, as for 
Atchievements of highest merit, decreed excessive Honours; Arches, 
Triumphs, annual Solemnities, and the Surname of Britannicus both to him 
and his Son.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Suetonius writes that Claudius found here no Resistance, and that 
all was done without stroke but this seems not probable.  The Monmouth 
Writer names these two Sons of Cunobeline, Guiderius, and Arviragus; 
that Guiderius being slain in sight, Arviragus to conceal it, put on his 
Brother's Habiliments, and in his Person held up the Battel to a 
victory; the rest, as of Hamo the Roman Captain, Genuissa the Emperor's 
Daughter, and such like stuff, is too palpably untrue to be worth 
rehearsing in the midst of Truth.  Plautius after this, employing his 
fresh Forces to conquer on, and quiet the rebelling Countries, found 
work enough to deserve at his return a kind of Triumphant riding into 
the Capital side by side with the Emperor. 42. Vespasian also under 
Plautius had thirty Conflicts with the Enemy; in one of which 
encompass'd, and in great danger, he was valiantly and piously rescu'd 
by his Son Titus: 43. two powerful Nations he subdu'd here, above 20 
Towns and the Isle of Wight; for which he receiv'd at Rome Triumphal 
Ornaments, and other great Dignities.  For that City in reward of Vertue 
was ever magnificent; and long after when true merit was ceas'd among 
them, lest any thing resembling Vertue should want honour, the same 
rewards were yet allow'd to the very shadow and ostentation of Merit. 
44. Ostorius in the room of Plautius Vice-pr[ae]tor, met with turbulent 
Affairs; the Britains not ceasing to vex with inroads all those 
Countries that were yielded to the Romans; and now the more eagerly, 
supposing that the new General unacquainted with his Army, and on the 
edge of Winter, would not hastily oppose them. 45. But he weighing that 
first events were most available to breed fear or contempt, with such 
Cohorts as were next at hand, sets out against them: whom having routed, 
so close he follows, as one who meant not to be every day molested with 
the Cavils of a slight Peace, or an embolden'd Enemy.  Lest they should 
make head again, he disarms whom he suspects; and to surround them, 
places many Garrisons upon the Rivers of Antona and Sabrina.  But the 
Icenians, a stout People, untouch'd yet by these Wars, as having before 
fought Alliance with the Romans, were the first that brook'd not this.  
By their Example others rise; and in a chosen place, fenc'd with high 
Banks of Earth, and narrow Lanes to prevent the Horse, warily encamp.  
Ostorius, though yet not strengthned with his Legions, causes the 
Auxiliar Bands, his Troops also alighting, to assault the rampart.  They 
within, though pester'd with their own number, stood to it like Men 
resolv'd, and in a narrow compass did remarkable Deeds.  But overpower'd 
at last, and others by their success quieted, who till then waver'd, 
Ostorius next bends his Force upon the Cangians, wasting all even to the 
Sea of Ireland, without Foe in his way, or them, who durst, ill handled; 
when the Brigantes attempting new matters, drew him back to settle first 
what was unsecure behind him.  They, of whom the chief were punish'd, 
with rest forgiven, soon gave over, but the Silures no way tractable, 
were not to be repress'd without a set War.  To further this, 
Camalodunum was planted with a Colony of Veteran Soldiers; to be a firm 
and ready Aid against Revolts, and a means to teach the Natives Roman 
Law and Civility.  Cogidunus also a British King, their fast Friend, had 
to the same intent certain Cities given him: a haughty Craft, which the 
Romans us'd, to make Kings also the servile Agents of enslaving others. 
46. But the Silures hardy of themselves, rely'd more on the Valour of 
Caractacus; whom many doubtful, many prosperous Successes had made 
eminent above all that ruled in Britain.  He adding to his Courage 
Policy, and knowing himself to be of Strength inferior, in other 
Advantages the better, makes the Seat of his War among the Ordovices; a 
Country wherein all the odds were to his own Party, all the difficulties 
to his Enemy.  The Hills and every Access he fortify'd with heaps of 
Stones, and Guards of Men; to come at whom a River of unsafe Passage 
must be first waded.  The place, as Camden conjectures, had thence the 
Name of Caer-Caradoc on the West edge of Shropshire.  He himself 
continually went up and down, animating his Officers and Leaders, that 
this was the Day, this the Field, either to defend their Liberty, or to 
die free; calling to mind the Names of his glorious Ancestors, who drove 
C[ae]sar the Dictator out of Britain, whose Valour hitherto had preserv'd 
them from Bondage, their Wives and Children from Dishonour.  Inflam'd 
with these Words, they all vow their utmost, with such undaunted 
resolution as amaz'd the Roman General; but the Soldiers less weighing, 
because less knowing, clamour'd to be led on against any Danger.  
Ostorius after wary Circumspection bids them pass the River: the 
Britains no sooner had them within reach of their Arrows, Darts and 
Stones, but slew and wounded largely of the Romans.  They on the other 
side closing their Ranks, and over head closing their Targets, threw 
down the loose Rampires of the Britains, and pursue them up the Hills, 
both light and armed Legions; till what with gauling Darts and heavy 
Strokes, the Britains, who wore neither Helmet nor Cuirass to defend 
them, were at last overcome.  This the Romans thought a famous Victory; 
wherin the Wife and Daughter of Caractacus were taken, his Brothers also 
reduc'd to obedience; himself escaping to Cartismandua Queen of the 
Brigantes, against Faith given was to the Victors deliver'd bound; 
having held out against the Romans nine Years, saith Tacitus, but by 
truer computation, seven.  Wherby his Name was up through all the 
adjoining Provinces, even to Italy and Rome; many desiring to see who he 
was, that could withstand so many Years the Roman Puissance: and C[ae]sar 
to extol his own Victory, extoll'd the Man whom he had vanquish'd.  
Being brought to Rome, the people as to a solemn Spectacle were call'd 
together, the Emperor's Guard stood in Arms.  In order came first the 
King's Servants, bearing his Trophies won in other Wars, next his 
Brothers, Wife, and Daughter, last himself.  The Behaviour of others, 
through fear, was low and degenerate; he only neither in Countenance, 
Word, or Action, submissive standing at the Tribunal of Claudius, 
briefly spake to this purpose: If my Mind, C[ae]sar, had bin as moderate in 
the height of Fortune, as my Birth and Dignity was eminent, I might have 
come a Friend rather then a Captive into this City.  Nor couldst thou 
have dislik'd him for a Confederate, so noble of descent, and ruling so 
many Nations.  My present Estate to me disgraceful, to thee is glorious.  
I had Riches, Horses, Arms, and Men; no wonder then if I contended, not 
to lose them.   But if by Fate, yours only must be Empire, then of 
necessity ours among the rest must be Subjection.  If I sooner had been 
brought to yield, my Misfortune had been less notorious, your Conquest 
had been less renown'd; and in your severest determining of me, both 
will be soon forgotten.  But if you grant that I shall live, by me will 
live to you for ever that praise which is so near divine, the clemency 
of a Conqueror.  C[ae]sar mov'd at such a Spectable of Fortune, but 
especially at the nobleness of his bearing it, gave him pardon, and to 
all the rest.  They all unbound, submissly thank him, and did like 
Reverence to Agrippina the Emperor's Wife, who sat by in State; a new 
and disdained sight to the manly Eyes of Romans, a Woman sitting public 
in her female Pride among Ensigns and armed Cohorts.  To Ostorius 
Triumph is decreed; and his Acts esteem'd equal to theirs, that brought 
in Bonds to Rome famousest Kings.  But the same Prosperity attended not 
his later Actions here; for the Silures, whether to revenge their loss 
of Caractacus, or that they saw Ostorius, as if now all were done, less 
earnest to restrain them, beset the Prefect of his Camp, left there with 
Legionary Bands to appoint Garisons: And had not speedy Aid come in from 
the neighbouring Holds and Castles, had cut them all off; 
notwithstanding which, the Prefect with eight Centurions, and many their 
stoutest Men, were slain: and upon the neck of this, meeting first with 
Roman Foragers, then with other Troops hasting to their relief, utterly 
foil'd and broke them also.  Ostorius sending more after, could hardly 
stay their flight; till the weighty Legions coming on, at first pois'd 
the Battle, at length turn'd the Scale: to the Britains without much 
loss, for by that time it grew Night.  Then was the War shiver'd, as it 
were, into small Frays and Bickerings; not unlike sometimes to so many 
Robberies, in Woods, at Waters, as Chance or Valour, Advice or Rashness, 
led them on, commanded or without command.  That which most exasperated 
the Silures, was a Report of certain Words cast out by the Emperor, That 
he would root them out to the very Name.  Therfore two Cohorts more of 
Auxiliars, by the advice of their Leaders too securely pillaging, they 
quite intercepted; and bestowing liberally the Spoils and Captives, 
wherof they took plenty, drew other Countries to join with them.  These 
Losses falling so thick upon the Romans, Ostorius with the thought and 
anguish therof ended his days; the Britains rejoicing, although no 
Battel, that yet adverse War had worn out so great a Soldier.  C[ae]sar in 
his place ordains Aulus Didius: but ere his coming, though much 
hasten'd, that the Province might not want a Governour, the Silures had 
given an overthrow to Manlius Valens with his Legion, rumour'd on both 
sides greater then was true, by the Silures  to amate the new General; 
by him in a double respect, of the more praise if he quell'd them, or 
the more excuse if he fail'd.  Mean time the Silures forget not to 
infest the Roman Pale with wide Excursions; till Didius marching out, 
kept them somewhat more within bounds.  Nor were they long to seek, who 
after Caractacus should lead them; for next to him in worth and skill of 
War, Venutius  a Prince of the Brigantes, merited to be their Chief.  He 
at first faithful to the Romans, and by them protected, was the Husband 
of Cartismandua Queen of the Brigantes, himself perhaps reigning 
elsewhere.  She who had betray'd Caractacus and her Country to adorn the 
Triumph of Claudius, thereby grown powerful and gracious with the 
Romans, presuming on the hire of her Treason, deserted her Husband; and 
marrying Vellocatus one of his Squires, confers on him the Kingdom also.  
This Deed so odious and full of Infamy, disturb'd the whole State; 
Venutius with other Forces, and the help of her own Subjects, who 
detested the Example of so foul a Fact, and withal the uncomeliness of 
their Subjection to the Monarchy of a Woman, a piece of Manhood not 
every day to be found among Britains, though she had got by subtile 
train his Brother with many of his Kindred into her hands, brought her 
soon below the confidence of being able to resist longer.  When 
imploring the Roman Aid, with much ado, and after many a hard Encounter, 
she escap'd the Punishment which was ready to have seiz'd her.  Venutius 
thus debar'd the Authority of ruling his own Houshold, justly turns his 
Anger against the Romans themselves; whose Magnanimity not wont to 
undertake dishonourable Causes, had arrogantly intermedled in his 
Domestic Affairs, to uphold the Rebellion of an Adulteress against her 
Husband.  And the Kingdom he retain'd against their utmost opposition; 
and of War gave them their fill: first in a sharp Conflict of uncertain 
Event, then against the Legion of C[ae]sius Nasica.  Insomuch that Didius 
growing old, and managing the War by Deputies, had work enough to stand 
on his Defence, with the gaining now and then of a small Castle.47.  And 
Nero (for in that part of the Isle things continu'd in the same plight 
to the reign of Vespasian ) was minded but for shame to have withdrawn 
the Roman Forces out of Britain: In other parts wherof, about the same 
time other things befel. 48. Berannius, whom Nero sent hither to succeed 
Didius, dying in his first Year, save a few Inroads upon the Silures, 
left only a great Boast behind him, That in two Years, had he liv'd, he 
would have conquer'd all.  But Suetonius Paulinus, who next was sent 
hither, esteem'd a Soldier equal to the best in that Age, for two Years 
together went on prosperously, both confirming what was got, and 
subduing onward.  At last over-confident of his present Actions, and 
emulating others, of whose Deeds he heard from abroad, marches up as far 
as Mona, the Isle of Anglesey, a populous place.  For they, it seems, 
had both intertain'd Fugitives, and given good Assistance to the rest 
that withstood him.  He makes him Boats with flat bottoms, fitted to the 
Shallows which he expected in that narrow Frith; his Foot so pass'd 
over, his Horse waded or swom.  Thick upon the Shore stood several gross 
Bands of Men well weapon'd, many Women like Furies running to and fro in 
dismal Habit, with Hair loose about their Shoulders, held Torches in 
their hands.  The Druids, those were their Priests, of whom more in 
another place, with hands lift up to Heaven uttering direful Prayers, 
astonish'd the Romans; who at so strange a sight stood in amaze, though 
wounded: At length awak'd and encouraged by their General, not to fear a 
barbarous and lunatic Rout, fall on, and beat them down scorch'd and 
rolling in their own Fire.  Then were they yok'd with Garisons, and the 
Places consecrate to their bloody Superstitions destroy'd.  For whom 
they took in War, they held it lawful to sacrifice; and by the Entrails 
of Men us'd Divination.  While thus Paulinus had his thought still fix'd 
before to go on winning, his back lay broad open to occasion of losing 
more behind: For the Britains, urg'd and oppress'd with many 
unsufferable Injuries, had all banded themselves to a general Revolt.  
The particular Causes are not all written by one Author; Tacitus who 
liv'd next those Times of any to us extant, writes that Prasutagus King 
of the Icenians, abounding in Wealth, had left C[ae]sar Coheir with his two 
Daughters; therby hoping to have secur'd from all wrong both his Kingdom 
and his House; which fell out far otherwise.  For under colour to 
oversee and take possession of the Emperor's new Inheritance, his 
Kingdom became a Prey to Centurions, his House to ravening Officers, his 
Wife Boadicea violated with Stripes, his Daughters with Rape, the 
wealthiest of his Subjects, as it were, by the Will and Testament of 
their King thrown out of their Estates, his Kindred made little better 
then Slaves.  The new Colony also at Camalodunum took House or Land from 
whom they pleas'd, terming them Slaves and Vassals; the Soldiers 
complying with the Colony, out of hope herafter to use the same Licence 
themselves.  Moreover, the Temple erected to Claudius as a Badge of 
their eternal Slavery, stood a great Eye-sore; the Priests wherof, under 
pretext of what was due to the religious Service, wasted and embezled 
each Man's Substance upon themselves.  And Catus Decianus the 
Procurator, endeavour'd to bring all their Goods within the compass of a 
new Confiscation, by disavowing the remitment of Claudius. 49. Lastly, 
Seneca, in his Books a Philosopher, having drawn the Britains 
unwillingly to borrow of him vast Sums upon fair Promises of easy Loan, 
and for repayment to take their own time, on a sudden compels them to 
pay in all at once with great Extortion.  Thus provok'd by heaviest 
Sufferings, and thus invited by Opportunities, in the absence of 
Paulinus, the Icenians, and by their Example the Trinobantes, and as 
many else as hated Servitude, rise up in Arms.  Of these ensuing 
Troubles many foregoing Signs appear'd; the Image of Victory at 
Camalodunum fell down of it self with her face turn'd, as it were, to 
the Britains; certain women, in a kind of Extasy, foretold of Calamities 
to come: In the Council-house were heard by night barbarous Noises; in 
the Theatre hideous Howlings, in the Creek horrid Sights, betokening the 
destruction of that Colony; hereto the Ocean seeming of a bloody hue, 
and human shapes at a low ebb, left imprinted on the Sand, wrought in 
the Britians new Courage, in the Romans unwonted Fears.  Camalodunum, 
where the Romans had seated themselves to dwell pleasantly, rather then 
defensively was not fortify'd; against that therfore the Britains make 
first assault.  The Soldiers within were not very many.  Decianus the 
Procurator could send them but 200, those ill arm'd: and through the 
Treachery of some among them, who secretly favour'd the Insurrection, 
they had deferr'd both to entrench, and to send out such as bore not 
Arms; such as did, flying to the Temple, which on the second day was 
forcibly taken, were put all to the Sword, the Temple made a heap, the 
rest rifled and burnt.  Petilius Cerealis coming to his succour, is in 
his way met and overthrown, his whole Legion cut to pieces; he with his 
Horse hardly escaping to the Roman Camp.  Decianus, whose rapine was the 
cause of all this, fled into Gallia.  But Suetonius at these tidings not 
dismay'd, through the midst of his Enemies Country, marches to London 
(though not term'd a Colony, yet full of Roman Inhabitants, and for the 
frequency of Trade, and other Commodities, a Town even then of principal 
note) with purpose to have made there the set of War.  But considering 
the smalness of his Numbers, and the late rashness of Petilius, he 
chuses rather with the loss of one Town to save the rest.  Nor was he 
flexible to any Prayers or Weeping of them that besought him to tarry 
there; but taking with him such as were willing, gave signal to depart; 
they who through weakness of Sex or Age, or love of the place went not 
along, perish'd by the Enemy; so did Verulam, a Roman free Town.  For 
the Britains omitting Forts and Castles, flew thither first where 
richest Booty, and the hope of pillaging toald them on.  In this 
Massacre about 70000 Romans and their Associates, in the places above-
mention'd, of a certain lost their lives.  None might be spar'd, none 
ransom'd, but tasted all either a present or a lingring Death; no 
cruelty that either outrage, or the insolence of Success put into their 
heads, was left unacted. 50. The Roman Wives and Virgins hang'd up all 
naked, had their Breasts cut off, and sew'd to their Mouths; that in the 
grimness of Death they might seem to eat their own Flesh; while the 
Britains fell to feasting and carousing in the Temple of Andate their 
Goddess of Victory.  Suetonius adding to his Legion other old Officers 
and Soldiers therabout, which gather'd to him, were near upon ten 
thousand; and purposing with those not to defer Battel, had chosen a 
place narrow, and not to be overwing'd, on his rear a Wood; being well 
inform'd that his Enemies were all in front on a Plain unapt for Ambush: 
the Legionaries stood thick on order, impal'd with light armed; the 
Horse on either Wing.  The Britains in Companies and Squadrons were 
every where shouting and swarming, such a multitude as at other time 
never; no less reckon'd then 200 and 30 thousand, so fierce and 
confident of Victory, that their Wives also came in Waggons to sit and 
behold the sports as they made full account of killing Romans: a Folly 
doubtless for the serious Romans to smile at, as a sure Token of 
prospering that day: a Woman also was their Commander in Chief.  For 
Boadicea and her Daughter ride about in a Chariot, telling the tall 
Champions as a great Encouragement, that with the Britains it was usual 
for Women to be their Leaders.  A deal of other Fondness they put into 
her mouth, not worth recital; how she was lash'd, how her  Daughters 
were handled, things worthier Silence, Retirement, and a Vail, then for 
a Woman to repeat, as done to her own Person, or to hear repeated before 
an Host of Men.  The Greek Historian 51. sets her in the Field on a high 
heap of Turves, in a loose-bodied Gown declaiming, a Spear in her Hand, 
a Hare in her Bosom, which after a long Circumlocution she was to let 
slip among them for luck's sake; then praying to Andate the British 
Goddess, to talk again as fondly as before.  And this they do out of a 
Vanity, hoping to embellish and set out their History with the 
strangeness of our Manners, not caring in the mean while to brand us 
with the rankest note of Barbarism, as if in Britain Women were Men, and 
Men Women.  I affect not set Speeches in a History, unless known for 
certain to have been so spoken in effect as they are written, nor then, 
unless worth rehearsal and to invent such, though eloquently, as some 
Historians have done, is an Abuse of Posterity, raising in them that 
read other Conceptions of those Times and Persons then were true.  Much 
less therfore do I purpose here or elsewhere to copy out tedious 
Orations without Decorum, though in their Authors compos'd ready to my 
hand.  Hitherto what we have heard of Cassibelan, Togadumnus, Venusius, 
and Caractacus, hath been full of Magnanimity, Soberness, and martial 
Skill: but the truth is, that in this Battel and whole Business the 
Britains never more plainly manifested themselves to be right 
Barbarians; no Rule, no Foresight, no Forecast, Experience or 
Estimation, either of themselves or of their Enemies; such Confusion, 
such Impotence, as seem'd likest not to a War, but to the wild hurry of 
a distracted Woman, with as mad a Crew at her heels.  Therefore 
Suetonius, contemning their unruly Noises and fierce Looks, heartens his 
Men but to stand close a while, and strike manfully this headless Rabbel 
that stood nearest, the rest would be a purchase rather then a toil.  
And so it fell out; for the Legion, when they saw their time, bursting 
out like a violent wedge, quickly broke and dissipated what oppos'd 
them; all else held only out their Necks to the Slayer; for their own 
Carts and Waggons were so plac'd by themsleves, as left them but little 
room to escape between.  The Roman slew all; Men, Women, and the very 
drawing Horses lay heap'd along the Field in a gory mixture of 
Slaughter.  About fourscore thousand Britains were said to have been 
slain on the place; of the Enemy scarce 400, and not many more wounded.  
Boadicea poison'd her self, or, as others say, sicken'd and died. 52. 
She was of Stature big and tall, of Visage grim and stern, harsh of 
Voice, her Hair of a bright colour flowing down to her Hips; she wore a 
plighted Garment of divers Colours, with a great golden Chain; button'd 
over all a thick Robe.  Gildas calls her the crafty Lioness, and leaves 
an ill fame upon her doings.  Dion sets down otherwise the Order of this 
Fight, and that the Field was not won without much difficulty, nor 
without intention of the Britains to give another Battel, had not the 
Death of Boadicea come between.  Howbeit Suetonius, to preserve 
Discipline, and to dispatch the Reliques of War, lodg'd with all the 
Army in the open Field; which was supply'd out of Germany with 1000 
Horse and 10000 Foot; thence dispers'd to winter, and with Incursions to 
waste those Countries that stood out.  But to the Britains Famine was a 
worse Affliction; having left off, during this uproar, to till the 
Ground, and made reckoning to serve themselves on the Provisions of 
their Enemy.  Nevertheless those Nations that were yet untam'd, hearing 
of some Discord risen between Suetonius and the new Procurator 
Classicianus, were brought but slowly to terms of Peace; and the Rigour 
us'd by Suetonius on them that yielded, taught them the better Course to 
stand on their Defence.  For it is certain that Suetonius, 53. though 
else a worthy Man, over-proud of his Victory, gave too much way to his 
Anger against the Britains.  Classicianus therfore sending such word to 
Rome, that these severe Proceedings would beget an endless War, 
Polycletus, no Roman Courtier, was sent by Nero to examine how things 
went.  He admonishing Suetonius to use more Mildness, aw'd the Army, and 
to the Britains gave matter of Laughter.  Who so much even till then 
were nurs'd up in their native Liberty, as to wonder that so great a 
General with his whole Army should be at the Rebuke and ordering of a 
Court-Servitor.  But Suetonius a while after, 54. having lost a few 
Galleys on the shore, was bid resign his Command to Petronius 
Turpilianus, who not provoking the Britains, nor by them provok'd, was 
thought to have pretended the Love of Peace to what indeed was his Love 
of Ease and Sloth.  Trebellius Maximus follow'd his steps, usurping the 
name of Gentle Government to any Remissness or Neglect of Discipline; 
which brought in first Licence, next Disobedience into his Camp; 
incens'd against him partly for his Covetousness, partly by the 
Incitement of Roscius C[ae]lius, Legate of a Legion; with whom formerly 
disagreeing, now that civil War began in the Empire, he fell to open 
discord; charging him with Disorder and Sedition, 55. and him C[ae]lius 
with peeling and defrauding the Legions of their Pay; insomuch that 
Trebellius hated and deserted of the Soldiers, was content a while to 
govern by base Entreaty, and forc'd at length to fly the Land.  Which 
notwithstanding remain'd in good quiet, govern'd by C[ae]lius and the other 
Legate of a Legion, both faithful to Vitellius then Emperor; who sent 
hither Vectius Bolanus;56. under whose Lenity, though not tainted with 
other Fault, against the Britains nothing was done, nor in their own 
Discipline reform'd.57.  Petilius Cerealis by appointment of Vespasian 
succeeding, had to do with the populous Brigantes in many Battels, and 
some of those not unbloody.58.  For as we heard before,59. it 
wasVenusius who even to these times held them back,60. both himself 
remaining to the end unvanquish'd, and some part of his Country not so 
much as reach'd.61.  It appears also by several Passages in the 
Histories of Tacitus, that no small number of British Forces were 
commanded over Sea the Year before to serve in those bloody Wars between 
Otho and Vitellius, Vitellius and Vespasian contending for the Empire.  
To Cerealis succeeded Julius Frontinus in the Government of Britain, who 
by taming the Silures, a People warlike and strongly inhabiting, 
augmented much his Reputation.62.  But Julius Agricola, whom Vespasian 
in his last Year sent hither, train'd up from his Youth in the British 
Wars, extended with Victories the Roman Limit beyond all his 
Predecessors.  His coming was in the midst of Summer; and the Ordovices 
to welcome the new General had hewn in pieces a whole Sqadron of Horse 
which lay upon their Bounds, few escaping.  Agricola, who perceiv'd that 
the noise of this Defeat had also in the Province desirous of Novelty 
stirr'd up new Expectations, resolves to be before-hand with the danger: 
and drawing together the choice of his Legions with a competent number 
of Auxiliars, not being met by the Ordovices, who kept the Hills, 
himself in the head of his Men, hunts them up and down through difficult 
places, almost to the final extirpating of that whole Nation.  With the 
same current of Success, what Paulinus had left unfinish'd he conquers 
in the Isle of Mona: for the Islanders altogether fearless of his 
Approach, whom they knew to have no Shipping, when the saw themselves 
invaded on a sudden by the Auxiliars, whose Country Use had taught them 
to swim over with Horse and Arms, were compel'd to yield.  This gain'd 
Agricola much opinion; who at his very entrance, a time which others 
bestow'd of course in hearing Complements and Gratulations, had made 
such early Progress into laborious and hardest Enterprises.  But by far 
not so famour was Agricola in bringing War to a speedy end, as in 
cutting off the Causes from whence War arises.  For he knowing that the 
end of War was not to make way for Injuries in Peace, began Reformation 
from his own House; permitted not his Attendants and Followers to sway, 
or have to do at all in publick Affairs: lays on with Equality the 
Proportions of Corn and Tribute that were impos'd; takes off Exactions, 
and the Fees of encroaching Officers, heavier then the tribute it self.  
For the Countries had been compell'd before, to sit and wait the opening 
of public Granaries, and both to sell and to buy their Corn at what 
rate, the Publicans thought fit; the Purveyors also commanding when they 
pleas'd to bring it in, not to the nearest, but still to the remotest 
places, either by the compounding of such as would be excus'd, or by 
causing a Dearth, where none was, made a particular Gain.  These 
Grievances and the like, he in the time of Peace removing, brought Peace 
into some credit; which before, since the Romans coming, had as ill a 
name as War. 63. The Summer following, Titus then Emperor, he so 
continually with Inroads disquieted the Enemy over all the Isle, and 
after Terror so allur'd them with his gentle Demeanour, that many Cities 
which till that time would not bend, gave Hostages, admitted Garrisons, 
and came in voluntarily.  The Winter he spent all in worthy Actions; 
teaching and promoting like a public Father the Institutes and Customs 
of civil Life.  The Inhabitants rude and scatter'd, and by that the 
proner to War, he so persuaded as to build Houses, Temples and Seats of 
Justice; and by praising the forward, quickening the slow, assisting 
all, turn'd the name of Necessity into an Emulation.  He caus'd moreover 
the Noble-mens Sons to be bred up in liberal Arts; and by preferring the 
Wits of Britain before the Studies of Gallia, brought them to affect the 
Latin Eloquence, who before hated the Language.  Then were the Roman 
Fashions imitated, and the Gown; after a while the Incitements also and 
Materials of Vice, and voluptuous Life, proud Buildings, Baths, and the 
Elegance of Banqueting; which the foolisher sort call'd Civility, but 
was indeed a secret Art to prepare them for Bondage. 64. Spring 
appearing, he took the Field, and with a prosperous Expedition wasted as 
far Northward as the Frith of Taus all that obeyed not, with such a 
Terror, as he went, that the Roman Army, though much hinder'd by 
tempestuous Weather, had the leisure to build Forts and Castles where 
they pleas'd, none daring to oppose them.  Besides, Agricola had this 
Excellence in him, so providently to chuse his Places where to fortify, 
as not another General then alive.  No Sconce or Fortress of his raising 
was ever known either to have been forc'd, or yielded up, or quitted.  
Out of these impregnable by Siege, or in that case duly reliev'd, with 
continual Irruptions he so prevail'd, that the Enemy, whose manner was 
in Winter to regain what in Summer he had lost, was now alike in both 
Seasons kept short and straitned.  For these Exploits, then esteem'd so 
great and honourable, Titus in whose Reign they were atchiev'd was the 
fifteenth time saluted Imperator;65. and of him Agricola receiv'd 
triumphal Honours.66.  The fourth Summer, Domitian then ruling the 
Empire, he spent in settling and confirming what the Year before he had 
travel'd over with a running Conquest.  And had the Valour of his 
Soldiers been answerable, he had reach'd that Year, as was thought, the 
utmost Bounds of Britain.  For Glota and Bodotria, now Dunbritton, and 
the Frith of Edinburrow, two opposite Arms of the Sea, divided only by a 
neck of Land, and all the Creeks and Inlets on this side, were held by 
the Romans, and the Enemy driven as it were into another Island. 67. In 
his fifth Year he pass'd over into the Orcades, as we may probably 
guess, and other Scotch Isles; discovering and subduing Nations, till 
then unknown.  He gain'd also with his Forces that part of Britain which 
faces Ireland, as aiming also to conquer that Island; where one of the 
Irish Kings driven out by civil Wars coming to him, he both gladly 
receiv'd and retain'd him as against a fit time. 68. The Summer ensuing, 
on mistrust that the Nations beyond Bodotria would generally rise, and 
forelay the Passages by Land, he caus'd his Fleet, making a great shew, 
to bear along the Coast, and up the Friths and Harbours; joining most 
commonly at Night on the same shore both Land and Sea-Forces, with 
mutual Shouts and loud Greetings.  At sight wherof the Britains, not 
wont to see their Sea so ridden, were much daunted.  Howbeit the 
Caledonians with great Preparation, and by Rumor, as of things unknown 
much greater, taking Arms, and of their own accord beginning war by the 
Assault of sundry Castles, sent back some of their Fear to the Romans 
themselves: and there were of the Commanders, who cloking their fear 
under shew of sage Advice, counsell'd the General to retreat back on 
this side Bodotria.  He in the mean while having intelligence, that the 
Enemy would fall on in many Bodies, divided also his Army into three 
parts.  Which advantage the Britains quickly spying, and on a sudden 
uniting what before they had disjoin'd, assail by night with all their 
forces that part of the Roman Army which they knew to be the weakest; 
and breaking in upon the Camp, surpris'd between sleep and fear, had 
begun some Execution.  When Agricola, who had learnt what way the 
Enemies took and follow'd them with all speed, sending before him the 
lightest of his Horse and Foot to charge them behind, the rest as they 
came on to affright them with clamour, so ply'd them without respite, 
that by approach of day the Roman Ensigns glittering all about, had 
encompass'd the Britains: who now after a sharp fight in the very Ports 
of the Camp, betook them to their wonted refuge, the Woods and Fens, 
pursu'd a while by the Romans; that day else in all appearance had ended 
the War.  The Legions reincouraged by this event, they also now 
boasting, who but lately trembled, cry all to be led on as far as there 
was British Ground.  The Britains also not acknowledging the loss of 
that day to Roman Valour, but to the policy of their Captain, abated 
nothing of their stoutness; but arming their youth, conveying their 
Wives and Children to places of safety, in frequent Assemblies, and by 
solemn Covenants bound themselves to mutual assistance against the 
common Enemy.  About the same time a Cohort of Germans having slain 
their Centurion with other Roman Officers in a Mutiny, and for fear of 
punishment fled on shipboard, launch'd forth in three light Galleys 
without Pilot; and by Tide or Weather carried round about the coast,69. 
using Piracy where they landed, while their Ships held out, and as their 
skill serv'd them, with various fortune, were the first discoverers to 
the Romans that Britain was an Island. 70. The following Summer, 
Agricola having before sent his Navy to hover on the Coast, and with 
sundry and uncertain Landings to divert and disunite the Britains, 
himself with a power best appointed for Expedition, wherin also were 
many Britains, whom he had long try'd both valiant and faithful, marches 
onward to the Mountain Grampius, where the British, above 30 thousand, 
were now lodg'd, and still encreasing; for neither would their old men, 
so many as were yet vigorous and lusty, be left at home, long practis'd 
in War, and every one adorn'd with some Badge, or Cognizance of his 
warlike Deeds long ago.  Of whom Galgacus, both by Birth and Merit the 
prime Leader to their courage, though of it self hot and violent, is by 
his rough Oratory, in destestation of Servitude and the Roman Yoke, said 
to have added much more eagerness of Fight, testify'd by their shouts 
and barbarous applauses.  As much did on the other side Agricola exhort 
his Soldiers to Victory and Glory; as much the Soldiers by his firm and 
well-grounded Exhortations were all on a fire to the Onset.  But first 
he orders them on this sort: Of 8000 Auxiliar Foot he makes his middle 
Ward, on the wings 3000 Horse, the Legions as a Reserve, stood in array 
before the Camp; either to seize the Victory won without their own 
hazard, or to keep up the Battel if it should need.  The British Powers 
on the Hill side, as might best serve for shew and terrour, stood in 
their Battalions; the first on even Ground, the next rising behind, as 
the Hill ascended.  The Field between rung with the noise of Horsemen 
and Chariots ranging up and down.  Agricola doubting to be over-wing'd, 
stretches out his Front, though somewhat with the thinnest, insomuch 
that many advis'd to bring up the Legions: yet he not altering, alights 
from his Horse, and stands on foot before the Ensigns.  The fight began 
aloof, and the Britains had a certain skill with their broad swashing 
Swords and short Bucklers either to strike aside, or to bear off the 
Darts of their enemies; and withal to send back showers of their own.  
Until Agricola discerning that those little Targets and unwieldy Glaves 
ill pointed, would soon become ridiculous against the thrust and close, 
commanded three Batavian Cohorts, and two of the Tungrians exercis'd and 
arm'd for close fight, to draw up, and come to handy-strokes.  The 
Batavians, as they were commanded, running in upon them, now with their 
long Tucks thrusting at the face, now with their piked Targets bearing 
them down, had made good riddance of them that stood below; and for 
haste omitting further Execution, began apace to advance up hill, 
seconded now by all the other Cohorts.  Mean while the Horse-men fly, 
the Charioteers mix themselves to fight among the Foot, where many of 
their Horse also fallen in disorderly, were now more a mischief to their 
own, then before a terror to their Enemies.  The Battel was a confus'd 
heap, the ground unequal; Men, Horses, Chariots crouded Pelmel; 
sometimes in little room, by and by in large, fighting, rushing, 
felling, over-bearing, over-turning.  They on the Hill, which were not 
yet come to blows, perceiving the fewness of their Enemies, came down 
amain; and had enclos'd the Romans unawares behind, but that Agricola 
with a strong Body of Horse, which he resev'd for such a purpose, 
repell'd them back as fast; and others drawn off the front, were 
commanded to wheel about and charge them on the backs.  Then were the 
Romans clearly Masters; they follow, they wound, they take, and to take 
more, kill whom they take: the Britains in whole Troops with Weapons in 
their hands, one while flying the Pursuer, anon without Weapons 
desperately running upon the Slayer.  But all of them, when once they 
got the Woods to their shelter, with fresh boldness made head again, and 
the forwardest on a sudden they turn'd and slew, the rest so hamper'd, 
as had not Agricola, who was every where at hand, sent out his readiest 
Cohorts, with part of his Horse to alight and scower the Woods, they had 
receiv'd a foyl in the midst of Victory; but following with a close and 
orderly pursuit, the Britains fled again, and were totally scatter'd; 
till Night and Weariness ended the chase.  And of them that day ten 
thousand fell; of the Romans 340, among whom Aulus Atticus the Leader of 
a Cohort; carried with heat of Youth, and the fierceness of his Horse 
too far on.  The Romans jocund of this Victory, and the spoil they got, 
spent the Night; the vanquish'd wandering about the Field, both Men and 
Women, some lamenting, some calling their lost Friends, or carrying off 
their Wounded; others forsaking, some burning their own Houses; and it 
was certain enough, that there were who with a stern Compassion laid 
violent hands on their Wives and Children, to prevent the more violent 
hands of hostile Injury.  Next day appearing, manifested more plainly 
the greatness of their loss receiv'd; every where silence, desolation, 
Houses burning afar off, not a Man seen, all fled, and doubtful whither: 
such word the Scouts bringing in from all parts, and the Summer now 
spent, no fit season to disperse a War, the Roman General leads his Army 
among the Horestians; by whom Hostages being given, he commands his 
Admiral with a sufficient Navy to sail round the Coast of Britain; 
himself with slow marches, that his delay in passing might serve to awe 
those new conquer'd Nations, bestows his Army in their Winter-quarters.  
The Fleet also having fetch'd a prosperous and speedy compass about the 
Isle,71. put in at the Haven Trutulensis, now Richborrow near Sandwich, 
from whence it first set out:72 and now likeliest, if not two years 
before, as was mention'd, the Romans might discover and subdue the Isles 
of Orkney;73. which others with less reason, following Eusebius and 
Orosius, attribute to the deeds of Claudius.  These perpetual Exploits 
abroad won him wide fame; with Domitian, under whom great Virtue was as 
punishable as open Crime, won him Hatred.74.  For he maligning the 
renown of these his acts, in shew decreed him honours, in secret devis'd 
him ruin. 75. Agricola therfore, commanded him for doing too much of 
what he was sent to do, left the Province to his Successor quiet and 
secure.  Whether he, as is conjectured, were Salustius Lucullus, or 
before him some other, for Suetonius only names him Legate of Britain 
under Domitian; but further of him, or aught else done here until the 
time of Hadrian, is no where plainly to be found.  Some gather by a 
Preface in Tacitus to the Book of his Histories, that what Agricola won 
here, was soon after by Domitian either through want of Valour lost, or 
through Envy neglected.  And Juvenal the Poet speaks of Arviragus in 
these days, and not before, King of Britain; who stood so well in his 
resistance, as not only to be talk'd of at Rome, but to be held matter 
of a glorious Triumph, if Domitian could take him captive, or overcome 
him.  Then also Claudia Rusina the Daughter of a Britain, and Wife of 
Pudence a Roman Senator, liv'd at Rome; famous by the Verse of Martial 
for Beauty, Wit, and Learning.  The next we hear of Britain, is, that 
when Trajan was Emperor, it revolted, and was subdued.  But Hadrian next 
entring on the Empire, they soon unsubdu'd themselves.76.  Julius 
Severus, saith Dion, then govern'd the Island, a prime Soldier of that 
Age: he being call'd away to suppress the Jews then in tumult, left 
things at such a pass, as caus'd the Emperor in person to take a Journey 
hither;77. where many things he reform'd78. and, as Augustus, and 
Tiberius counsel'd to gird the Empire within moderate Bounds, he rais'd 
a Wall with great Stakes driven in deep, and fastned together, in manner 
of a strong Mound, fourscore mile in length, to divide what was Roman 
from Barbarian; as his manner was to do in other Frontiers of his 
Empire; where great Rivers divided not the Limits.  No ancient Author 
names the place, but old Inscriptions, and Ruin it self yet testifies 
where it went along between Solway Firth by Carlisle, and the Mouth of 
Tine. 79. Hadrian having quieted the Island, took it for honour to be 
titled on his Coin, The Restorer of Britain.  In his time also Priscus 
Licinius, as appears by an old Inscription, was Lieutenant here.  
Antonius Pius reigning, the Brigantes ever least patient of foreign 
Servitude, breaking in upon Genounia 80. (which Camden guesses to be 
Guinethia or North-Wales ) part of the Roman Province, were with the 
loss of much Territory driven back by Lollius Urbicus, who drew another 
Wall of Turves;81. in likelihood much beyond the former, and as Camden 
proves,82. between the Frith of Dunbritton, and of Edinburrow; to hedge 
out Incursions from the North.83.  And Seius Saturninus, as is collected 
from the Digests, had charge here of the Roman Navy.84.  With like 
success did Marcus Aurelius, next Emperor,85. by his Legate Calphurnius 
Agricola, finish here a new War: Commodus after him obtaining the 
Empire.  In his time, as among so many different accounts may seem most 
probable, Lucius a suppos'd King in some part of Britain,86. the first 
of any King in Europe, that we read of, receiv'd the Christian Faith, 
and this Nation the first by public Authority profess'd it: a high and 
singular Grace from above, if sincerity and perseverance went along, 
otherwise an empty boast, and to be fear'd the verifying of that true 
sentence, The first shall be last.  And indeed the praise of this action 
is more proper to King Lucius, then common to the Nation; whose first 
professing by public Authority was no real commendation of their true 
Faith, which had appear'd more sincere and praise-worthy, whether in 
this or other Nation, first profess'd without public Authority or 
against it, might else have been but outward conformity.  Lucius in our 
Monmouth Story is made the second by Descent from Marius; Marius the Son 
of Arviragus is there said to have overthrown the Picts then first 
coming out of Scythia, slain Roderic their King; and in sign of Victory 
to have set up a Monument of Stone in the Country since call'd 
Westmaria: but these things have no foundation.  Coilus the son of 
Marius, all his Reign, which was just and peaceable, holding great amity 
with the Romans, left it hereditary to Lucius.  He (if Beda err not, 
living near 500 Years after, yet our ancientest Author of this report) 
sent to Elutherius then Bishop of Rome, an improbable Letter, as some of 
the Contents discover,87. desiring that by his appointment he and his 
People might receive Christianity.  From whom two Religious Doctors, 
nam'd in our Chronicles Faganus and Deruvianus, forthwith sent, are said 
to have converted and baptiz'd well nigh the whole Nation:88. thence 
Lucius to have had the surname of Levermaur, that is to say, Great 
Light.  Nor yet then first was the Christian Faith here known, but even 
from the latter days of Tiberius, as Gildas confidently affirms, taught 
and propagated, and that as some say by Simon Zelotes, as others by 
Joseph of Arimathea, Barnabas, Paul, Peter, and their prime Disciples.  
But of these matters, variously written and believ'd, Ecclesiastic 
Historians can best determine; as the best of them do, with little 
Credit given to the particulars of such uncertain relations.  As for 
Lucius, they write, that after a long Reign he was buried in 
Glocester;89. but dying without Issue, left the Kingdom in great 
commotion.  By truer testimony we find that the greatest War which in 
those days busy'd Commodus, was in this Island.90.  For the Nations 
Northward, notwithstanding the Wall rais'd to keep them out, breaking in 
upon the Roman Province, wasted wide; and both the Army and the Leader 
that came against them wholly routed, and destroy'd; which put the 
Emperor in such a fear, as to dispatch hither one of his best 
Commanders, Ulpius Marcellus.91.  He a Man endu'd with all nobleness of 
mind, frugal and temperate, mild and magnanimous, in War bold and 
watchful, invincible against Lucre, and the assault of Bribes; what with 
his Valour, and these his other Virtues, quickly ended this War that 
look'd so dangerous, and had himself like to have been ended by the 
Peace which he brought home, for presuming to be so worthy and so good 
under the envy of so worthless and so bad an Emperor.  After whose 
departure the Roman Legions fell to Sedition among themselves;92. 
fifteen hundred of them went to Rome  in name of the rest,93. and were 
so terrible to Commodus himself, as that to please them he delivered up 
to their care Perennis the Captain of his Guard, for having in the 
British War remov'd their Leaders, who were Senators, and in their 
places put those of the Equestrian Order.  Notwithstanding which 
compliance, they endeavoured here to set up another Emperor against him; 
and Helvius Pertinax who succeeded Governour, found it a work so 
difficult to appease them, that once in a Mutiny he was left for dead 
among many slain; and though afterwards he severely punish'd the 
Tumulters, was fain at length to seek a dismission from his Charge.94.  
After him Clodius Albinus took the Government;95. but he, for having to 
the Soldiers made an Oration against Monarchy, by the appointment of 
Commodus was bid resign to Junius Severus. 96. But Albinus in those 
troublesome times ensuing under the short Reign of Pertinax and Didius 
Julianus, found means to keep in his hands the Government of Britain;97. 
although Septimius Severus who next held the Empire, sent hither 
Heraclitus to displace him;98. but in vain, for Albinus with all the 
British Powers and those of Gallia met Severus about Lyons in France,99. 
and fought a bloody Battel with him for the Empire, though at last 
vanquish'd and slain.100.  The Government of Britain, Severus divided 
between two Deputies; till then one Legate was thought sufficient; the 
North he committed to Virius Lupus. 101. Where the Meat[ae] rising in Arms, 
and the Caledonians, though they had promis'd the contrary to Lupus, 
preparing to defend them, so hard beset, he was compell'd to buy him 
Peace,102. and a few of Prisoners with great Sums of Money.  But hearing 
that Severus had now brought to an end his other Wars,103. he writes him 
plainly the state of things here, that the Britains of the North made 
war upon him, broke into the Province, and harrass'd all the Countries 
nigh them, that there needed suddenly either more Aid, or himself in 
Person.  Severus, though now much weaken'd with Age and the Gout, yet 
desirous to leave some Memorial of his warlike Atchievements here, as he 
had done in other places, and besides to withdraw by this means his two 
Sons from the Pleasures of Rome, and his Soldiers from Idleness, with a 
mighty power far sooner then could be expected, arrives in Britain.104.  
The Northern People much daunted with the report of so great Forces 
brought over with him, and yet more preparing, send Embassadors to treat 
of Peace, and to excuse their former doings.  The Emperor now loth to 
return home without some memorable thing done, wherby he might assume to 
his other Titles the addition of Britannicus, delays his Answer, and 
quickens his Preparations; till in the end, when all things were in 
readiness to follow them, they are dismiss'd without effect.  His 
principal care was to have many Bridges laid over Bogs and rotten Mores, 
that his Soldiers might have to fight on sure footing.  For it seems 
through lack of Tillage, the Northern Parts were then, as Ireland is at 
this day; and the Inhabitants in like manner wanted to retire, and 
defend themselves in such watery places half naked.105.  He also being 
past Adrian's Wall, cut down Woods, made ways through Hills, fasten'd 
and fill'd up unsound and plashy Fens.  Notwithstanding all this 
Industry us'd, the Enemy kept himself so cunningly within his best 
Advantages, and seldom appearing, so opportunely found his time to make 
Irruption upon the Romans, when they were most in straits and 
difficulties, sometimes training them on with a few Cattel turn'd out, 
and drawn within Ambush cruelly handling them, that many a time enclos'd 
in the midst of Sloughs and Quagmires,106. they chose rather themselves 
to kill such as were faint and could not shift away, then leave them 
there a Prey to the Caledonians.  Thus lost Severus, and by Sickness in 
those noisome places, no less then fifty thousand Men: and yet desisted 
not, though for Weakness carried in a Litter, till he had march'd 
through with his Army to the utmost Northern Verge of the Isle: and the 
Britains offering Peace, were compell'd to lose much of their Country 
not before subject to the Romans.107.  Severus on the Frontiers of what 
he had firmly conquer'd, builds a Wall cross the Island from Sea to 
Sea;108. which one Author judges the most magnificent of all his other 
Deeds; and that he thence receiv'd the stile of Britannicus; in length 
132 Miles.109.  Orosius adds it fortify'd with a deep Trench,110. and 
between certain Spaces many Towers, or Battlements.  The place wherof 
some will have to be in Scotland, the same which Lollius Urbicus had 
wall'd before.111.  Others affirm it only Hadrian's Work re-edify'd; 
both plead Authorities and the ancient Track yet visible:112. but this I 
leave among the studious of these Antiquities to be discuss'd more at 
large.  While Peace held, the Empress Julia meeting on a time certain 
British Ladies, and discoursing with the Wife of Argentocoxus a 
Caledonian, cast out a Scoff against the Looseness of our Island Women; 
whose manner then was to use promiscuously the Company of divers Men.  
Whom straight the British Woman boldly thus answer'd: Much better do we 
Britains fulfil the work of Nature then you Romans; we with the best Men 
accustom openly; you with the basest commit private Adulteries.  Whether 
she thought this Answer might serve to justify the practice of her 
Country, as when Vices are compar'd, the greater seems to justify the 
less, or whether the Law and Custom wherin she was bred, had whipt out 
of her Conscience the better Dictate of Nature, and not convinc'd her of 
the shame; certain it is, that wheras other Nations us'd a liberty not 
unnatural for one Man to have many Wives,113. the Britains altogether as 
licentious, but more absurd and preposterous in their licence, had one 
or many Wives in common among ten or twelve Husbands; and those for the 
most part incestuously.  But no sooner was Severus return'd into the 
Province, then the Britains take Arms again.  Against whom Severus, worn 
out with Labours and Infirmity, sends Antoninus his eldest Son, expresly 
commanding him to spare neither Sex nor Age.  But Antoninus, who had his 
wicked thoughts taken up with the contriving of his Father's Death, a 
safer Enemy then a Son, did the Britains not much detriment.  Wherat 
Severus, more overcome with Grief then any other Malady ended his Life 
at York.114.  After whose decease Antoninus Caracalla his impious Son, 
concluding Peace with the Britains, took Hostages and departed to 
Rome.115.  The Conductor of all this Northern War, Scotish Writers name 
Donaldus, he of Monmouth Fulgenius, in the rest of his relation nothing 
worth.  From hence the Roman Empire declining apace, good Historians 
growing scarce, or lost, have left us little else but Fragments for many 
years ensuing.  Under Gordian the Emperor we find by the Inscription of 
an Altar-stone,116. that Nonius Philippus govern'd here.117.  Under 
Galienus we read there was a strong and general revolt from the Roman 
Legate.118.  Of the thirty Tyrants which not long after took upon them 
the stile of Emperor, by many Coins found among us,119. 
Lollianus,Victorinus, Posthumus, the Tetrici and Marius are conjectured 
to have risen or born great sway in this Island.120. 121. Whence 
Porphyrius, a Philosopher then living, said that Britain was a Soil 
fruitful of Tyrants;122. and is noted to be the first Author123. that 
makes mention of the Scotish Nation.124.  While Probus was Emperor, 
Bonosus the Son of a Rhetorician, bred up a Spaniard, though by descent 
a Britain, and a matchless Drinker,125. nor much to be blam'd, if, as 
they write, he were still wisest in his Cups, having attain'd in warfare 
to high Honours, and lastly in his Charge over the German Shipping, 
willingly, as was thought, miscarried, trusting on him power with the 
Western Armies, and join'd with Proculus, bore himself a while for 
Emperor; but after a long and bloody fight at Cullen, vanquish'd by 
Probus he hang'd himself, and gave occasion of a ready Jest made on him 
for his much drinking; Here hangs  a Tankard, not a Man.126.  After 
this, Probus with much Wisdom prevented a new rising here in Britain by 
the severe Loyalty of Victorinus a Moor, at whose entreaty he had plac'd 
here that Governour which rebell'd.  For the Emperor upbraiding him with 
the Disloyalty of whom he had commended, Victorinus undertaking to set 
all right again, hastes thither, and finding indeed the Governour to 
intend Sedition, by some contrivance not mention'd in the Story,127. 
slew him, whose Name some imagine to be Cornelius Lelianus.  They write 
also that Probus gave leave to the Spaniards, Gauls and Britains to 
plant Vines, and to make Wine; and having subdu'd the Vandals, and 
Burgundians in a great Battel,128. sent over many of them hither to 
inhabit, where they did good Service to the Romans when any Insurrection 
happen'd in the Isle.129.  After whom Carus Emperor going against the 
Persians, left Carinus one of his Sons130. to govern among other Western 
Provinces this Island with Imperial Authority; but him Dioclesian, 
saluted Emperor by the Eastern Arms, overcame and slew.131.   About 
which time Carausius, a Man of low Parentage, born in Menapia,132. about 
the parts of Cleves and Juliers, who through all military degrees was 
made at length Admiral of the Belgic and Armoric Seas, then much 
infested by the Franks and Saxons,133. what he took from the Pyrates, 
neither restoring to the Owners, nor accounting to the Public, but 
enriching himself,134. and yet not scowring the Seas, but conniving 
rather at those Sea-Robbers, was grown at length too great a Delinquent 
to be less then an Emperor; for fear and guiltiness in those days made 
Emperors oftner then merit: And understanding that Maximianus Herculius, 
Dioclesian's adopted Son, was come against him into Gallia, pass'd over 
with the Navy which he had made his own, into Britain, and possess'd the 
Island.135.  Where he built a new Fleet after the Roman fashion,136. got 
into his power the Legion that was left here in Garison, other 
outlandish Cohorts detain'd, lifted the very Merchants and Factors of 
Gallia, and with the allurement of Spoil invited great numbers of other 
barbarous Nations to his part, and train'd them to Sea-Service, wherin 
the Romans at that time were grown so out of skill, that Carausius with 
his Navy did at Sea what he listed, robbing on every Coast; wherby 
Maximilian, able to come no nearer then the shore of Boloigne, was 
forc'd to conclude a Peace with Carausius, and yield him Britain;137. as 
one fittest to guard the Province there against Inroads from the North.  
But not long after having assum'd Constantius Chlorus to the Dignity of 
C[ae]sar, sent him against Carausius;138. who in the mean while had made 
himself strong both within the Land and without.139.  Galfred of 
Monmouth writes, that he made the Picts his Confederates; to whom lately 
come out of Scythia he gave Albany to dwell in: and it is observ'd, that 
before his time the Picts are not known to have bin any where mention'd, 
and then first by Eumenius a Rhetorician.140.  He repair'd and fortify'd 
the Wall of Severus with seven Castles, and a round House of smooth 
Stone on the Bank of Carron, which River, saith Ninnius, was of his Name 
so call'd; he built also a Triumphal Arch in remembrance of some Victory 
there obtain'd.  In France he held Gessoriacum, or Boloigne;141. and all 
the Franks which had by his permission seated themselves in Belgia, were 
at his devotion.  But Constantius hasting into Gallia, besieges 
Boloigne, and with Stones and Timber obstructing the Port, keeps out all 
Relief that could be sent in by Carausius.  Who ere Constantius with the 
great Fleet which he had prepar'd, could arrive hither, was slain 
treacherously by Alectus one of his Friends,142. who long'd to step into 
his place; when he seven Years, and worthily as some say, as others 
tyrannically, had rul'd the Island.  So much the more did Constantius 
prosecute that opportunity, before Alectus could well strengthen his 
Affairs:143. and though in ill Weather, putting to Sea with all urgency 
from several Havens to spread the terror of his landing, and the doubt 
where to expect him, in a Mist passing the British Fleet useen, that lay 
scouting near the Isle of Wight, no sooner got ashore, but fires his own 
Ships, to leave no hope of Refuge but in Victory.144.  Alectus also, 
though now much dismay'd transfers his Fortune to a Battel on the shore; 
but encounter'd by Asclepiodotus Captain of the Pr[ae]torian Bands, and 
desperately rushing on, unmindful both of ordering his Men, or bringing 
them all to fight, save the Accessories of hisTreason, and his 
outlandish Hirelings, is overthrown, and slain with little or no loss to 
the Romans, but great execution on the Franks.  His Body was found 
almost naked in the Field, for his Purple Robe he had thrown aside, lest 
it should descry him, unwilling to be found.  The rest taking flight to 
London, and purposing with the Pillage of that City to escape by Sea, 
are met by another part of the Roman Army, whom the Mist at Sea 
disjoining had by chance brought thither, and with a new slaughter 
chas'd through all the Streets.  The Britains, their Wives also and 
Children, with great joy got out to meet Constantius, as one whom they 
acknowledge their Deliverer from Bondage and Insolence.  All this seems 
by Eumenius, who then liv'd, and was of Constantius's Houshold, to have 
bin done in the course of one contin'd Action; so also thinks Sigonius a 
learned Writer: though all others allow three Years to the Tyranny of 
Alectus.145.  In these days were great store of Workmen, and excellent 
Builders in this Island, whom after the alteration of things here, the 
[ae]duans in Burgundy entertain'd to build their Temples and public 
Edifices.  Dioclesian having hitherto successfully us'd his Valour 
against the Enemies of his Empire, uses now his Rage in a bloody 
Persecution against his obedient and harmless Christian Subjects:146. 
from the feeling whereof neither was this Island, though most remote, 
far enough remov'd.  Among them here who suffer'd gloriously, Aron, and 
Julius of Caerleon upon Usk, but chiefly Alban of Verulam, were most 
renown'd: The Story of whose Martyrdom soil'd, and worse martyr'd with 
the fabling Zeal of some idle Fancies, more fond of Miracles, then 
apprehensive of Truth, deserves not longer digression.  Constantius 
after Dioclesian, dividing the Empire with Gaterius, had Britain among 
his other Provinces; where either preparing or returning with Victory 
from an Expedition against the Caledonians, he died at York.  His Son 
Constantine, who happily came post from Rome to Boloigne, just about the 
time, saith Eumenius,147. that his Father was setting sail his last time 
hither,148. and not long before his Death, was by him on his Death-bed 
nam'd, and after his Funeral, by the whole Army saluted Emperor.  There 
goes a fame, and that seconded by most of our own Historians,149. though 
not those the ancientest, that Constantine was born in this Island, his 
Mother Helena the Daughter of Coilus a British Prince, not sure the 
Father of King Lucius, whose Sister she must then be, for that would 
detect her too old by a hundred Years to be the Mother of Constantine.  
But to salve this Incoherence, another Coilus is feign'd to be then Earl 
of Colchester.  To this therfore the Roman Authors give no 
testimony,150. except a Passage or two in the Panegyrics,151. about the 
sense wherof much is argu'd:152. Others nearest to those times clear the 
Doubt, and write him certainly born of a mean Woman, Helena, the 
Concubine of Constantius, at Naisus in Dardania.153.  Howbeit, ere his 
departure hence, he seems to have had some Bickerings in the North,154. 
which by reason of more urgent Affairs compos'd, he passes into 
Gallia;155. and after four years returns either to settle or to alter 
the state of things here,156. until a new War against Maxentius call'd 
him back, leaving Pacatianus his Vicegerent.157.  He deceasing, 
Constantine his eldest Son enjoy'd for his part of the Empire, with all 
the Provinces that lay on this side the Alps, this Island also.158.  But 
falling to Civil War with Constans his Brother, was by him slain;159. 
who with his third Brother Constantius coming into Britain, seiz'd it as 
Victor.160.  Against him rose Magnentius, one of his chief Commanders, 
by some affirm'd the Son of a Britain,161. he having gain'd on his side 
great Forces, contested with Constantius in many Battels for the sole 
Empire; but vanquish'd, in the end slew himself.162.  Somewhat before 
this time Gratianus Funarius, the Father of Valentinian,163. afterwards 
Emperor, had chief command of those Armies which the Romans kept 
here.164.  And the Arian Doctrine which then divided Christendom,165. 
wrought also in this Island no small Disturbance;166. a Land, saith 
Gildas, greedy of every thing new, stedfast in nothing.  At last 
Constantius appointed a Synod of more then 400 Bishops167. to assemble 
at Ariminum on the Emperor's Charges, which the rest all refusing, three 
only of the British, poverty constraining them, accepted; though the 
other Bishops among them offer'd to have born their charges; esteeming 
it more honourable to live on the Public, then to be obnoxious to any 
private Purse.  Doubtless an ingenuous Mind, and far above the 
Presbyters of our Age; who like well to sit in Assembly on the public 
Stipend, but lik'd not the Poverty that caus'd these to do so.  After 
this Martinus was Deputy of the Province; who being offended with the 
Cruelty which Paulus, an Inquisitor sent from Constantius, exercis'd in 
his enquire after those Military Officers who had conspir'd with 
Magnentius, was himself laid hold on as an Accessory; at which enrag'd 
he runs at Paulus with his drawn Sword; but failing to kill him, turns 
it on himself.  Next to whom, as may be guess'd, Alipius was made 
Deputy.  In the mean time Julian, whom Constantius had made C[ae]sar,168. 
having recover'd much Territory about the Rhine, where the German 
Inrodes before had long insulted,169. to relieve those Countries almost 
ruin'd, causes 800 Pinnaces to be built;170. and with them, by frequent 
Voyages, plenty of Corn to be fetch'd in from Britain; which even then 
was the usual Bounty of this Soil to those parts,171. as oft as French 
and Saxon Pirates hinder'd not the transportation.172.  While 
Constantius yet reign'd, the Scots and Picts breaking in upon the 
Northern Confines, Julian, being at Paris,173. sends over Lupicinus, a 
well-try'd Soldier, but a proud and covetous Man, who with a Power of 
light-arm'd Herulians, Batavians, and M[ae]sians, in the midst of Winter 
sailing from Boloigne, arrives at Rutupi[ae] seated on the opposite Shore, 
and comes to London, to consult there about the War; but soon after was 
recall'd by Julian then chosen Emperor.  Under whom we read not of aught 
happening here,174. only that Palladius one of his great Officers was 
hither banish'd.175.   This Year Valentinian being Emperor, the 
Atticots, Picts, and Scots, roving up and down, and last the Saxons with 
perpetual Landings and Invasions harryed the South Coast of Britain; 
slew Nectaridius who govern'd the Sea-Borders, and Bulchobaudes with his 
Forces by an Ambush.  With which News Valentinian not a little perplext, 
sends first Severus High Steward of his House, and soon recals him; then 
Jovinus, who intimating the necessity of greater Supplies, he sends at 
length Theodosius, a Man of try'd Valour and Experience, Father to the 
first Emperor of that Name.  He with selected Numbers out of the 
Legions,176. and Cohorts, crosses the Sea from Boloigne to Rutupi[ae]; from 
whence with the Batavians, Herulians, and other Legions that arriv'd 
soon after, he marches to London; and dividing his Forces into several 
Bodies, sets upon the dispers'd and plundering enemy, laden with Spoil; 
from whom recovering the Booty which they led away, and were forc'd to 
leave there with their Lives, he restores all to the right Owners, save 
a small Portion to his wearied Soldiers, and enters London victoriously; 
which, before in many Straits and Difficulties, was now reviv'd as with 
a great Deliverance.  The numerous Enemy with whom he had to deal, was 
of different Nations, and the War scatter'd: Which Theodosius, getting 
daily some Intelligence from Fugitives and Prisoners, resolves to carry 
on by sudden Parties and Surprisals, rather then set Battels; nor omits 
he to proclaim Indemnity to such as would lay down Arms, and accept of 
Peace, which brought in many.  Yet all this not ending the Work, he 
requires that Civilis, a Man of much Uprightness, might be sent him, to 
be as Deputy of the Island, and Dulcitius a famous Captain.  Thus was 
Theodosius busy'd, besetting with Ambushes the roving enemy, repressing 
his Roads, restoring Cities and Castles to their former Safety and 
Defence, laying every where the firm Foundation of a long Peace, when 
Valentinus a Pannonian,177. for some great Offence banish'd into 
Britain,178. conspiring with certain Exiles and Soldiers against 
Theodosius,179. whose Worth he dreaded as the only Obstacle to his 
greater Design of gaining the Isle into his power, is discover'd, and 
with his chief Accomplices deliver'd over to condign Punishment: Against 
the rest, Theodosius with a wise Lenity suffer'd not Inquisition to 
proceed too rigorously, lest the fear therof appertaining to so many, 
occasion might arise of new Trouble in a time so unsettled.  This done, 
he applies himself to reform things out of order, raises on the Confines 
many strong-holds; and in them appoints due and diligent Watches: and so 
reduc'd all things out of danger, that the Province which but lately was 
under command of the Enemy, became now wholly Roman, new nam'd Valentia 
of Valentinian, and the City of London, Augusta.  Thus Theodosius nobly 
acquitting himself in all Affairs, with general applause of the whole 
Province, accompanied to the Sea-side, returns to Valentinian.180.  Who 
about five Years after sent hither Fraomarius, a King of the Almans, 181 
with Authority of a Tribune over his own Country Forces; which then both 
for number and good service, were in high esteem.  Against Gratian who 
succeeded in the Western Empire, Maximus a Spaniard, and one who had 
serv'd in the British Wars with younger Theodosius,182. (for he also, 
either with his Father, or not long after him, seems to have done 
something in this Island)183. and now General of the Roman Armies here, 
either discontented that Theodosius was preferr'd before him to the 
Empire, or constrain'd by the Soldiers who hated Gratian, assumes the 
Imperial Purple;184. and having attain'd Victory against the Scots and 
Picts, with the flower and strength of Britain,185. passes into France; 
there slays Gratian,186. and without much difficulty, the space of five 
Years, obtains his part of the Empire,187. overthrown at length, and 
slain by Theodosius. 188. With whom perishing most of his Followers, or 
not returning out of Armorica,189. which Maximus had given them to 
possess, the South of Britain by this means exhausted of her Youth, and 
what there was of Roman Soldiers on the Confines drawn off, became a 
Prey to savage Invasions;190. of Scots from the Irish Seas, of Saxons 
from the German, of Picts from the North.  Against them, first 
Chrysanthus the Son of Marcian a Bishop, made Deputy of Britain by 
Theodosius, demean'd himself worthily:191. then Stilicho a Man of great 
Power, whom, Theodosius dying, left Protector of his Son Honorius, 
either came in Person, or sending over sufficient Aid, repress'd them, 
and as it seems new fortify'd the Wall against them.192.  But that 
Legion being call'd away, when the Roman Armies from all parts hasted to 
relieve Honorius then besieg'd in Asta of Piedmont, by Alaric the Goth, 
193. Britain was left expos'd as before, to those barbarous Robbers.  
Lest any wonder how the Scots came to infest Britain from the Irish Sea, 
it must be understood, that the Scots not many Years before had been 
driven all out of Britain by Maximus;194. and their King Eugenius slain 
in Fight, as their own Annals report:195. wherby, it seems, wandring up 
and down, without certain Seat, they liv'd by scumming those Seas and 
Shores as Pirates.  But more authentic Writers confirm us, that the 
Scots, whoever they be originally, came first into Ireland, and dwelt 
there, and nam'd it Scotia long before the North of Britain took that 
Name.  Orosius who liv'd at this time writes,196. that Ireland was then 
inhabited by Scots.  About this time, though troublesome, Pelagius a 
Britain found the leisure to bring new and dangerous Opinions into the 
Church,197. and is largely writ against by St. Austin.  But the Roman 
Powers which were call'd into Italy, when once the fear of Alaric was 
over, made return into several Provinces; and perhaps Victorinus of 
Tolosa, whom Rutilius the Poet much commends, might be then Prefect of 
this Island; if it were not he whom Stilicho sent hither.  Buchanan 
writes, that endeavouring to reduce the Picts into a Province, he gave 
the occasion of their calling back Fergusius and the Scots, whom Maximus 
with their help had quite driven out of the Island: and indeed the 
Verses of that Poet speak him to have been active in those parts.  But 
the time which is assign'd him later by Buchanan after Gratianus 
Municeps, by Camden after Constantine the Tyrant, accords not with that 
which follows in the plain course of History.198.  For the Vandals 
having broke in and wasted all Belgia, even to those places from whence 
easiest passage is into Britain,199. the Roman Forces here, doubting to 
be suddenly invaded, were all in uproar, and in tumultuous manner set up 
Marcus, who it may seem was then Deputy.  But him not found agreeable to 
their heady courses, they as hastily kill;200. for the giddy favour of a 
mutinying Rout is as dangerous as their Fury.  The like they do by 
Gratian a British Roman, in four Months advanc'd, ador'd, and 
destroy'd.201.  There was among them a common Soldier whose name was 
Constantine, with him on a sudden so taken they are, upon the Conceit 
put in them of the luckiness in his Name, as without other visible Merit 
to create him Emperor.  It fortun'd that the Man had not his Name for 
nought; so well he knew to lay hold, and make good use of an unexpected 
Offer.  He therfore with a waken'd Spirit, to the extent of his Fortune 
dilating his mind, which in his mean condition before lay contracted and 
shrunk up, orders with good Advice his Military Affairs: and with the 
whole Force of the Province, and what of British was able to bear Arms, 
he passes into France,  aspiring at least to an equal share with 
Honorius in the Empire.  Where, by the Valour of Edobecus a Frank, and 
Gerontius a Britain, and partly by persuasion, gaining all in his way, 
he comes to Arles.202.  With like felicity by his Son Constans, whom of 
a Monk he had made a C[ae]sar, and by the Conduct of Gerontius he reduces 
all Spain to his Obedience.  But Constans after this, displacing 
Gerontius, the Affairs of Constantine soon went to wrack; for he by this 
means alienated, set up Maximus one of his Friends against him in 
Spain;203. and passing into France, took Vienna by assault, and having 
slain Constans in that City, calls on the Vandals against Constantine; 
who by him incited, as by him before they had been repress'd, breaking 
forward, over-run most part of France.  But when Constantius Comes, the 
Emperor's General, with a strong Power came out of Italy, Gerontius 
deserted by his own Forces, retires into Spain; 204. where also growing 
into contempt with the Soldiers, after his flight out of France, by whom 
his House in the night was beset,205. having first with a few of his 
Servants defended himself valiantly, and slain above 300, though when 
his Darts and other Weapons were spent, he might have scap'd at a 
private Door, as all his Servants did, not enduring to leave his Wife 
Nonnichia, whom he lov'd, to the violence of an enraged Crew, he first 
cuts off the Head of his Friend Alanus, as was agreed; next his Wife, 
though loth and delaying, yet by her entreated and importun'd, refusing 
to outlive her Husband, he dispatches: for which her Resolution, 
Sozomenus an Ecclesiatic Writer gives her high praise, both as a Wife, 
and as a Christian.  Last of all, against himself he turns his Sword; 
but missing the mortal place, with his Poniard finishes the Work.  Thus 
far is pursu'd the Story of a famous Britain, related negligently by our 
other Historians.  As for Constantine, his ending was not answerable to 
his setting out; for he with his other Son Julian besieg'd by 
Constantius in Arles, and mistrusting the change of his wonted Success, 
to save his head, poorly turns Priest; but that not availing him, is 
carried into Italy, and there put to death; having four Years acted the 
Emperor.  While these things were doing, the Britains at home, destitute 
of Roman Aid,206. and the chief strength of their own Youth, that went 
first with Maximus, then with Constantine, not returning home,207. vex'd 
and harass'd by their wonted Enemies, had sent Messages to Honorius;208. 
but he at that time not being able to defend Rome it self, which the 
same Year was taken by Alaric, advises them by his Letter to consult how 
best they might for their own Safety, and acquits them of the Roman 
Jurisdiction.209.  They therfore thus reliquish'd, and by all Right the 
Government relapsing into their own hands, thenceforth betook themselves 
to live after their own Laws, defending their Bounds as well as they 
were able; and the Armoricans, who not long after were call'd the 
Britains of France, follow'd their Example.  Thus expir'd this great 
Empire of the Romans; first in Britain, soon after in Italy it self: 
having born chief sway in this Island, though never throughly subdu'd, 
or all at once in subjection, if we reckon from the coming in of Julius 
to the taking of Rome by Alaric,210. in which year Honorius wrote those 
Letters of Discharge into Britain, the space of 462 Years.211.  And with 
the Empire fell also what before in this Western World was chiefly 
Roman; Learning, Valour, Eloquence, History, Civility, and even Language 
it self, all these together, as it were, with equal pace, diminishing 
and decaying.  Henceforth we are to steer by another sort of Authors; 
near enough to the things they write, as in their own Country, if that 
would serve; in time not much belated, some of equal Age, in expression 
barbarous; and to say how judicious, I suspend a while: This we must 
expect; in Civil Matters to find them dubious Relaters, and still to the 
best advantage of what they term Holy Church, meaning indeed themselves: 
in most other Matters of Religion, blind, astonish'd, and strook with 
Superstition as with a Planet; in one word, Monks.  Yet these Guides, 
where can be had no better, must be follow'd; in gross, it may be true 
enough; in circumstance each Man as his Judgment gives him, may reserve 
his Faith, or bestow it.  But so different a state of things requires a 
several relation.

THE THIRD BOOK.
------------------------------------------------------------

This third Book having to tell of Accidents as various and exemplary as 
the Intermission of Change of Government hath any where brought forth, 
may deserve Attention more then common, and repay it with like benefit 
to them who can judiciously read: considering especially that the late 
civil Broils had cast us into a condition not much unlike to what the 
Britains then were in, when the imperial Jurisdiction departing hence 
left them to the sway of their own Councils; which times by comparing 
seriously with these later, and that confused Anarchy with this 
Interreign, we may be able from two such remarkable turns of State, 
producing like Events among us, to raise a Knowledge of our selves both 
great and weighty, by judging hence what kind of Men the Britains 
generally are in Matters of so high Enterprise; how by Nature, Industry, 
or Custom, fitted to attempt or undergo Matters of so main Consequence: 
for if it be a high point of Wisdom in every private Man, much more is 
it in a Nation to know it self; rather then puft up with vulgar 
Flatteries and Encomiums, for want of self-knowledge, to enterprise 
rashly and come off miserably in great Undertakings.

[Note:  The following Paragraphs, mark'd with Quotation Marks, have been 
omitted in all the former Editions of our Author's History of Britain. ]

"Of these who sway'd most in the late Troubles, few words as to this 
point may suffice.  They had Arms, Leaders, and Successes to their wish; 
but to make use of so great an Advantage was not their skill.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">To other Causes therfore, and not to the want of Force, or warlike 
Manhood in the Britains, both those, and these lately, we must impute 
the ill Husbanding of those fair Opportunities, which might seem to have 
put Liberty so long desired, like a Bridle into their hands.  Of which 
other Causes equally belonging to Ruler, Priest, and People, above hath 
been related: which, as they brought those Ancient Natives to Misery and 
Ruin, by Liberty, which, rightly used, might have made them happy; so 
brought they these of late, after many Labours, much Blood-shed, and 
vast Expence, to ridiculous Frustration: in whom the like Defects, the 
like Miscarriages notoriously appeared, with Vices not less hateful or 
inexcusable.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">For a Parliament being call'd, to redress many things, as 'twas 
thought, the People with great Courage, and expectation to be eased of 
what discontented them, chose to their behoof in Parliament, such as 
they thought best affected to the Publick Good, and some indeed Men of 
Wisdom and Integrity; the rest, (to be sure the greater part,) whom 
Wealth or ample Possessions, or bold and active Ambition (rather then 
Merit) had commended to the same place.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">But when once the superficial Zeal and popular Fumes that acted 
their New Magistracy were cool'd, and spent in them, straight every one 
betook himself (setting the Common-wealth behind, his private Ends 
before) to do as his own Profit or Ambition led him.  Then was Justice 
delayed, and soon after deny'd: Spight and Favour determined all: Hence 
Faction, thence Treachery, both at home and in the field: Every where 
Wrong, and Oppression: Foul and horrid Deeds committed daily, or 
maintain'd, in secret, or in open.  Some who had been called from Shops 
and Ware-houses, without other Merit, to sit in supreme Councils and 
Committees, (as their Breeding was) fell to huckster the Commonwealth.  
Others did thereafter as Men could sooth and humour them best; so he who 
would give most, or under covert of hypocritical Zeal, insinuate basest, 
enjoyed unworthily the Rewards of Learning and Fidelity; or escaped the 
Punishmment of his Crimes and Misdeeds.  Their Votes and Ordinances, 
which Men look'd should have contained the repealing of bad Laws, and 
the immediate Constitution of better, resounded with nothing else, but 
new Impositions, Taxes, Excises; Yearly, Monthly, Weekly.  Not to reckon 
the Offices, Gifts, and Preferments bestowed and shared among 
themselves: They in the mean while, who were ever faithfullest to this 
Cause, and freely aided them in Person, or with their Substance, when 
they durst not compel either, slighted and bereaved after, of their just 
Debts by greedy Sequestrations, were tossed up and down after miserable 
Attendance  from one Committee to another with Petitions in their hands, 
yet either miss'd the obtaining of their suit, or though it were at 
length granted, (mere Shame and Reason oft-times extorting from them at 
least a shew of Justice) yet by their Sequestrators and Sub-Committees 
abroad, Men for the most part of insatiable hands, and noted Disloyalty, 
those Orders were commonly disobeyed: which for certain durst not have 
been, without secret Compliance, if not compact with some Superiors able 
to bear them out.  Thus were their Friends confiscate in their Enemies, 
while they forfeited their Debtors to the State, as they called it, but 
indeed to the ravening Seizure of innumerable Thieves in Office: Yet 
were withal no less burthened in all extraordinary Assessments and 
Oppressions, then those whom they took to be disaffected: Nor were we 
happier Creditors to what we call'd the State, then to them who were 
sequestred as the State's Enemies.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">For that Faith which ought to have been kept as sacred and 
inviolable as any thing holy, The Publick Faith, after infinite Sums 
received, and all the Wealth of the Church not better imploy'd, but 
swallowed up into a private Gulph, was not ere long ashamed to confess 
Bankrupt.  And now besides the sweetness of Bribery, and other gain, 
with the love of Rule, their own Guiltiness, and the dreaded name of 
just Account, which the People had long call'd for, discovered plainly 
that there were of their own number, who secretly contrived and fomented 
those Troubles and Combustions in the Land, which openly they sate to 
remedy; and would continually find such work, as should keep them from 
being ever brought to that Terrible Stand, of laying down their 
Authority for lack of new Business, or not drawing it out to any length 
of Time, tho' upon the Ruin of a whole Nation.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">And if the State were in this plight, Religion was not in much 
better; to reform which, a certain number of Divines were called, 
neither chosen by any Rule or Custom Ecclesiastical, nor eminent for 
either Piety or Knowledge above others left out; only as each Member of 
Parlament in his private Fancy thought fit, so elected one by one.  The 
most part of them were such, as had preach'd and cry'd down, with great 
shew of Zeal, the Avarice and Pluralities of Bishops and Prelates; that 
one Cure of Souls was a full Employment for one Spiritual Pastor how 
able soever, if not a Charge rather above human strength.  Yet these 
consciencious Men (ere any part of the Work done for which they came 
together, and that on the publick Salary) wanted not Boldness, to the 
Ignominy and Scandal of their Pastor-like Profession, and especially of 
their boasted Reformation, to seize into their hands, or not unwillingly 
to accept (besides one, sometimes two or more of the best Livings) 
Collegiate Masterships in the Universities, rich Lectures in the City, 
setting sail to all winds that might blow Gain into their covetous 
Bosoms: By which means these great Rebukers of Non-Residence, among so 
many distant Cures, were not ashamed to be seen so quickly Pluralists 
and Non-Residents themselves, to a fearful Condemnation doubtless by 
their own mouths.  And yet the main Doctrine for which they took such 
pay, and insisted upon with more vehemence then Gospel, was but to tell 
us in effect, that their Doctrine was worth nothing, and the Spiritual 
Power of their Ministry less available then bodily Compulsion; 
persuading the Magistrate to use it, as a stronger means to subdue and 
bring in Conscience, then Evangelical Persuasion: Distrusting the virtue 
of their own spiritual weapons, which were given them, if they be 
rightly called, with full warrant of sufficiency to pull down all 
thoughts and imaginations that exalt themselves against God.  But while 
they taught compulsion without convincement, which not long before they 
complained of, as executed unchristianly, against themselves; these 
intents are clear to have been no better then Antichristian: setting up 
a Spiritual Tyranny by a Secular Power, to the advancing of their own 
Authority above the Magistrate, whom they would have made their 
Executioner, to punish Church-Delinquencies, wherof Civil Laws have 
cognizance.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">And well did their Disciples manifest themsleves to be no better 
principled then their Teachers, trusted with Committeeships and other 
gainful Offices, upon their commendations for Zealous, (and as they 
stickt not to term them) Godly men; but executing their places like 
Children of the Devil, unfaithfully, unjustly, unmercifully; and where 
not corruptly, stupidly.  So that between them the Teachers, and these 
the Disciples, there hath not been a more ignominious and mortal wound 
to Faith, to Piety, to the work of Reformation, nor more cause of 
Blaspheming given to the Enemies of God and Truth, since the first 
Preaching of Reformation.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The People therfore looking one while on the Statists, whom they 
beheld without constancy or firmness, labouring doubtfully beneath the 
weight of their own too high Undertakings, busiest in petty things, 
trifling in the main deluded and quite alienated, expressed divers ways 
their disaffection; some despising whom before they honoured, some 
deserting, some inveighing, some conspiring against them.  Then looking 
on the Church-men, whom they saw under subtle Hypocrisy to have preached 
their own Follies, most of them not the Gospel, Time-servers, Covetous, 
Illiterate Persecutors, not lovers of the Truth, like in most things 
wherof they accused their Predecessors: Looking on all this, the People 
which had been kept warm a while with the counterfeit Zeal of their 
Pulpits, after a false heat, became more cold and obdurate then before, 
some turning to Lewdness, some to flat Atheism, put beside their old 
Religion, and foully scandalized in what they expected should be new.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Thus they who of late were extoll'd as our greatest Deliverers, 
and had the People wholly at their devotion, by so discharging their 
Trust as we see, did not only weaken and unfit themselves to be 
dispensers of what Liberty they pretended, but unfitted also the People, 
now grown worse and more disordinate, to receive or to digest any 
Liberty at all.  For Stories teach us, that Liberty sought out of 
season, in a corrupt and degenerate Age, brought Rome itself into a 
farther Slavery: For Liberty hath a sharp and double edge, fit only to 
be handled by just and vertuous Men; to bad and dissolute, it becomes a 
mischief unwieldy in their own hands: neither is it compleatly given, 
but by them who have the happy skill to know what is grievance, and 
unjust to a People, and how to remove it wisely; what good Laws are 
wanting, and how to frame them substantially, that good Men may enjoy 
the Freedom which they merit, and the bad the Curb which they need.  But 
to do this, and to know these exquisite proportions, the Heroick Wisdom 
which is required, surmounted far the Principles of these narrow 
Politicians: what wonder then if they sunk as these unfortunate Britains 
before them, entangled and opprest with things too hard and generous 
above their strain and temper?  For Britain, to speak a truth not often 
spoken, as it is Land fruitful enough of Men stout and courageous in 
War, so is it naturally not over-fertile of Men able to govern justly 
and prudently in Peace, trusting only in their Mother-Wit; who consider 
not justly, that Civility, Prudence, love of the Publick Good, more then 
of Money or vain Honour, are to this Soil in a manner outlandish; grow 
not here, but in minds well implanted with solid and elaborate Breeding, 
too impolitick else and rude, if not headstrong and intractable to the 
industry and vertue either of executing or understanding true Civil 
Government.  Valiant indeed, and prosperous to win a field; but to know 
the end and reason of winning, unjudicious, and unwise: in good or bad 
Success alike unteachable.  For the Sun which we want, ripens Wits as 
well as Fruits; and as Wine and Oil are imported to us from abroad; so 
must ripe Understanding, and many civil Vertues, be imported into our 
minds from foreign Writings, and Examples of best Ages, we shall else 
miscarry still, and come short in the attempts of any great Enterprise.  
Hence did their Victories prove as fruitless, as their losses dangerous; 
and left them still conquering under the same grievances, that men 
suffer conquered: which was indeed unlikely to go otherwise, unless men 
more then vulgar bred up, as few of them were, in the knowledge of 
antient and illustrious Deeds, invincible against many and vain Titles, 
impartial to Friendships and Relations, had conducted their Affairs: but 
then from the Chapman to the Retailer, many whose Ignorance was more 
audacious then the rest, were admitted with all their sordid Rudiments 
to bear no mean sway among them, both in Church and State.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">From the confluence of all their Errors, Mischiefs, and 
Misdemeanors, what in the eyes of Man could be expected, but what befel 
those Antient Inhabitants whom they so much resembled, Confusion in the 
end?
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">But on these things, and this Parallel, having enough insisted, I 
return to the story which gave us matter of this Digression." 

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The Britains thus, as we heard, being left without protection from 
the Empire, and the Land in a manner emptied of all her Youth, consum'd 
in Wars abroad, or not caring to return home, themselves through long 
Subjection, servile in Mind,1. slothful of Body, and with the use of 
Arms unacquainted,2. sustain'd but ill for many Years the Violence of 
those barbarous Invaders, who now daily grew upon them.3.   For although 
at first greedy of Change, and to be thought the leading Nation to 
Freedom from the Empire, they seem'd a while to bestir them with a shew 
of Diligence in their new Affairs, some secretly aspiring to rule, 
others adoring the name of Liberty, yet so soon as they felt by proof 
the weight of what it was to govern well themselves, and what was 
wanting within them, not stomach or the love of Licence, but the Wisdom, 
the Vertue, the Labour, to use and maintain true Liberty, they soon 
remitted their heat, and shrunk more wretchedly under the Burden of 
their own Liberty, then before under a foreign Yoke.  Insomuch that the 
Residue of those Romans which had planted themselves here, despairing of 
their ill Deportment at home, and weak Resistance in the field by those 
few who had the Courage or the Strength to bear Arms, nine Years after 
the sacking of Rome remov'd out of Britain into France,4. hiding for 
haste great part of their Treasure, which was never after found.5.  And 
now again the Britains, no longer able to support themselves against the 
prevailing Enemy,6. solicit Honorius to their aid, with mournful 
Letters, Embassages and Vows of perpetual Subjection to Rome,7. if the 
Northern Foe were but repuls'd.  He at their request spares them one 
Legion,8. which with great slaughter of the Scots and Picts drove them 
beyond the borders, rescu'd the Britains, and advis'd them to build a 
Wall cross the Island, between Sea and Sea, from the place where 
Edinburgh now stands to the Frith of Dunbritton, by the City Alcluith.9.  
But the Material being only Turf, and by the rude multitude 
unartificially built up without better Direction, avail'd them little.10  
For no sooner was the Legion departed, but the greedy Spoilers 
returning, land in great numbers from their Boats and Pinnaces, wasting, 
slaying, and treading down all before them.  Then are Messengers again 
posted to Rome in lamentable sort, beseeching that they would not suffer 
a whole Province to be destroy'd, and the Roman Name, so honourable yet 
among them, to become the Subject of Barbarian Scorn and Insolence.11.  
The Emperor, at their sad Complaint, with what speed was possible, sends 
to their succour.  Who coming suddenly on those ravenous multitudes that 
minded only Spoil, surprise them with a terrible slaughter.  They who 
escap'd fled back to those Seas, from whence yearly they were wont to 
arrive, and return laden with Booties.  But the Romans, who came not now 
to rule, but charitably to aid, declaring that it stood not longer with 
the ease of their Affairs to make such laborious Voyages in pursuit of 
so base and vagabond Robbers, of whom neither Glory was to be got, not 
Gain, exhorted them to manage their own Warfare; and to defend like Men 
their Country, their Wives, their Children, and what was to be dearer 
then Life, their Liberty, against an Enemy not stronger then themselves, 
if their own Sloth and Cowardice had not made them so; if they would but 
only find hands to grasp defensive Arms, rather then basely stretch them 
out to receive Bonds.12.  They gave them also their help to build a new 
Wall, not of Earth as the former, but of Stone, (both at the public 
Cost, and by particular Contributions)13. traversing the Isle in a 
direct Line from East to West, between certain Cities plac'd there as 
Frontiers to bear off the Enemy, where Severus had wall'd once before.  
They rais'd it 12 foot high, 8 broad.  Along the South-Shore, because 
from thence also like Hostility was fear'd, they place Towers by the 
Sea-side at certain distances, for safety of the Coast.  Withal they 
instruct them in the Art of War, leaving Patterns of their Arms and 
Weapons behind them; and with animating Words, and many Lessons of 
Valour to a faint-hearted Audience, bid them finally farewel, without 
purpose to return.  And these two freindly Expeditions, the last of any 
hither by the Romans, were perfrom'd, as may be gather'd out of Beda and 
Diaconus, the two last Years of Honorius.  Their Leader, as some 
modernly write, was Gallio of Ravenna; 15. Buchanan, who departs not 
much from the Fables of his Predecessor Boethius, names him 
Maximianus,16. and brings against him to this Battel Fergus first King 
of Scots, after their second suppos'd coming into Scotland, Durstus King 
of Picts, both there slain, and Dioneth an imaginary King of Britain, or 
Duke of Cornwal, who improbably sided with them against his own Country, 
hardly escaping.17.  With no less exactness of particular Circumstances 
he takes upon him to relate all those tumultuary Inroads of the Scots 
and Picts intoBritain, as if they had but yesterday happen'd, their 
order of Battel, manner of Fight, number of Slain, Articles of Peace, 
things whereof Gildas and Beda are utterly silent, Authors to whom the 
Scotch Writers have none to cite comparable in Antiquity; no more 
therfore to be believ'd for bare Assertions, however quaintly drest, 
then our Geoffrey of Monmouth when he varies most from authentick Story.  
But either the inbred Vanity of some, in that respect unworthily call'd 
Historians, or the fond Zeal of praising their Nations above Truth, hath 
so far transported them, that where they find nothing faithfully to 
relate, they fall confidently to invent what they think may either best 
set off their History, or magnify their Country.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The Scots and Picts in Manners differing somewhat from each other, 
but still unanimous to rob and spoil, hearing that the Romans intended 
not to return from their Gorroghs or leathern Frigates,18. pour out 
themselves in swarms upon the Land more confident then ever; and from 
the North-end of the Isle to the very Wall-side, then first took 
possession as Inhabitants; while the Britains with idle Weapons in their 
hands stand trembling on the Battlements, till the half-naked Barbarians 
with their long and formidable Iron Hooks pull them down headlong.  The 
rest not only quitting the Wall, but Towns and Cities, leave them to the 
bloody Pursuer, who follows killing, wasting, and destroying all in his 
way.  From these Confusions arose a Famine, and from thence Discord and 
civil Commotion among the Britains; each Man living by what he robb'd or 
took violently from him Neighbour.  When all Stores were consum'd and 
spent where Men inhabited, they betook them to the Woods, and liv'd by 
hunting, which was their only Sustainment. 19. To the heaps of these 
Evils from without were added new Divisions within the Church.20.  For 
Agricola the Son of Severianus a Pelagian Bishop had spread his Doctrine 
wide among the Britains, not uninfected before.  The sounder part 
neither willing to embrace his Opinion to the overthrow of Divine Grace, 
nor able to refute him, crave Assistance from the Churches of France: 
who send them Germanus Bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus of Troyes.21.  They 
by continual Preaching in Churches, in Streets, in Fields, and not 
without Miracles, as is written, confirm'd some, regain'd others, and at 
Verulam in a public Disputation put to silence their chief 
Adversaries.22.  This Reformation in the Church was believ'd to be the 
cause of their success a while after in the Field.23.  For the Saxons 
and Picts with joint force, which was no new thing before the Saxons at 
least had any dwelling in this Island, during the Abode of Germanus 
here, had made a strong impression from the North.24.  The Britains 
marching out against them, and mistrusting their own Power, send to 
Germanus and his Collegue, reposing more in the spiritual Strength of 
those two Men, then in their own thousands arm'd.  They came, and their 
Presence in the Camp was not less then if a whole Army had come to 
second them.  It was then the time of Lent, and the People instructed by 
the daily Sermons of these two Pastors, came flocking to receive 
Baptism.  There was a place in the Camp set apart as a Church, and 
trick'd up with Boughs upon Easter-day.  The Enemy understanding this, 
and that the Britains were taken up with Religions more then with feats 
of Arms, advances after the Paschal Feast, as to a certain Victory.  
German, who also had intelligence of their approach, undertakes to be 
Captain that day; and riding out with selected Troops to discover what 
Advantages the place might offer, lights on a Valley compass'd about 
with Hills, by which the Enemy was to pass.  And placing there his 
Ambush, warns them, that what word they heard him pronounce aloud, the 
same they should repeat with universal shout.  The Enemy passes on 
securely, and German thrice aloud cries Hallelujah; which answered by 
the Soldiers with a sudden burst of Clamour, is from the Hills and 
Valleys redoubled.  The Saxons and Picts on a sudden supposing it the 
noise of a huge Host, throw themselves into flight, casting down their 
Arms, and great numbers of them are drown'd in the River which they had 
newly pass'd.  This Victory, thus won without hands, left to the 
Britains plenty of Spoil, and the Person and the Preaching of German 
greater Authority and Reverence then before.  And the Exploit might pass 
for current, if Constantius, the Writer of his Life in the next Age, had 
resolv'd us how the British Army came to want baptizing; for of any 
Paganism at that time, or long before, in the Land we read not, or that 
Pelagianism was rebaptiz'd.  The place of this Victory, as is reported, 
was in Flintshire, by a Town call'd Guid-cruc, and the River Allen, 
where a Field retains the Name of Maes German to this day.25.  But so 
soon as German was return'd home, the Scots and Picts, though now so 
many of them Christians,26. that Palladius a Deacon was ordain'd and 
sent by Celestine the Pope to be a Bishop over them,27. were not so well 
reclaim'd,28. or not so many of them, as to cease from doing mischief to 
their Neighbours,29. where they found no impeachment to fall in yearly 
as they were wont.30.  They therfore of the Britains who perhaps were 
not yet wholly ruin'd, in the strongest and south-west parts of the 
Isle, send Letters to [ae]tius, then third time Consul of Rome, with this 
Superscription; To [ae]tius thrice Consul, the Groans of the Britains.31.  
And after a few words thus:32. The Barbarians drive us to the Sea, the 
Sea drives us back to the Barbarians; thus bandied up and down between 
two Deaths, we perish either by the Sword or by the Sea.  But the 
Empire, at that time overspread with Hunns and Vandals, was not in 
condition to lend them aid.  Thus rejected and wearied out with 
continual flying from place to place, but more afflicted with Famine, 
which then grew outrageous among them, many for Hunger yielded to the 
Enemy; others either more resolute, or less expos'd to wants, keeping 
within Woods and mountainous places, not only defended themselves, but 
sallying out at length gave a stop to the insulting Foe, with many 
seasonable Defeats; led by some eminent Person, as may be thought, who 
exhorted them not to trust in their own Strength, but in Divine 
Assistance.  And perhaps no other here is meant then the foresaid 
Deliverance by German, if computation would permit, which Gildas either 
not much regarded, or might mistake; but that he tarried so long here, 
the Writers of his Life assent not.33.  Finding therfore such 
opposition, the Scots or Irish Robbers, for so they are indifferently 
term'd, without delay get them home.  The Picts, as before was 
mention'd, then first began to settle in the utmost parts of the Island, 
using now and then to make Inroads upon the Britains.  But they in the 
mean while thus rid of their Enemies, begin afresh to till the Ground; 
which after Cessation yields her Fruit in such abundance, as had not 
formerly been known for many Ages.  But Wantonness and Luxury, the 
wonted Companions of Plenty, grow up as fast, and with them, if Gildas 
deserve belief, all other Vices incident to human Corruption.  That 
which he notes especially to be the chief perverting of all Good in the 
Land, and so continued in his days, was the hatred of Truth, and all 
such as durst appear to vindicate and maintain it.  Against them, as 
against the only Disturbers, all the Malice of the Land was bent.  Lyes 
and Falsities, and such as could best invent them, were only in request.  
Evil was embrac'd for Good, Wickedness honour'd and esteem'd as Vertue.  
And this quality their Valour had; against a foreign Enemy to be ever 
backward and heartless; to civil Broils eager and prompt.  In Matters of 
Government, and the search of Truth, weak and shallow; in Falshood and 
wicked Deeds pregnant and industrious.  Pleasing to God, or not 
pleasing, with them weighed alike; and the worse most an end was the 
weightier.  All things were done contrary to public Welfare and Safety; 
nor only by secular Men, for the Clergy also, whose Example should have 
guided others, were as vicious and corrupt.  Many of them besotted with 
continual Drunkenness, or swoln with Pride and Wilfulness, full of 
Contention, full of Envy, indiscreet, incompetent Judges to determine 
what in the practice of Life is good or evil, what lawful or unlawful.  
Thus furnished with Judgment, and for Manners thus qualified both Priest 
and Lay, they agree to choose them several Kings of their own; as near 
as might be, likest themselves; and the words of my Author import as 
much.  Kings were anointed, saith he, not of God's anointing, but such 
as were cruellest; and soon after as inconsiderately, without examining 
the truth, put to death, by their Anointers, to set up others more 
fierce and proud.  As for the Election of their Kings (and that they had 
not all one Monarch, appears both in Ages past and by the Sequel) it 
began, as nigh as may be guess'd, either this Year34. or the following, 
when they saw the Romans had quite deserted their claim.35.  About which 
time also Pelagianism again prevailing by means of some few,36. the 
British Clergy too weak, it seems, at dispute, entreat the second time 
German to their assistance.  Who coming with Severus a Disciple of 
Lupus, that was his former Associate, stands not now to argue, for the 
People generally continu'd right; but enquiring those Authors of new 
Disturbance, adjudges them to Banishment.37.  They therfore by consent 
of all were deliver'd to German;38. who carrying them over with him, 
dispos'd of them in such place where neither they could infect 
others,39. and were themselves under cure of better Instruction.  But 
Germanus the same year died in Italy; and the Britains not long after 
found themselves again in much perplexity, with no slight rumour that 
their old Troublers the Scots and Picts had prepar'd a strong Invasion, 
purposing to kill all, and dwell themselves in the Land from end to end.  
But ere their coming in, as if the Instruments of Divine Justice had 
been at strife, which of them first should destroy a wicked Nation, the 
Pestilence forestalling the Sword, left scarce alive whom to bury the 
dead; and for that time, as one Extremity keeps off another, preserv'd 
the Land from a worse Imcumbrance of those barbarous dispossessors, whom 
the Contagion gave not leave now to enter far.40.  And yet the Britains, 
nothing better'd by these heavy Judgments, the one threaten'd, the other 
felt, instead of acknowledging the hand of Heaven, run to the Palace of 
their King Vortigern with Complaints and Cries of what they suddenly 
fear'd from the Pictish Invasion.  Vortigern, who at that time was chief 
rather then sole King, unless the rest had perhaps left their Dominions 
to the common Enemy, is said by him of Monmouth to have procur'd the 
Death first of Constantine, then of Constance his Son; who of a Monk was 
made King, and by that means to have usurp'd the Crown.  But they who 
can remember how Constantine with his Son Constance the Monk, the one 
made Emperor, the other C[ae]sar, perish'd in France, may discern the 
simple fraud of this Fable.  But Vortigern however coming to reign, is 
decypher'd by truer stories a proud unfortunate Tyrant, and yet of the 
People much belov'd, because his vices sorted so well with theirs.  For 
neither was he skill'd in War, nor wise in Counsel, but covetous, 
lustful, luxurious, and prone to all Vice; wasting the public Treasure 
in Gluttony and Riot, careless of the common danger, and through a 
haughty Ignorance, unapprehensive of his own.  Nevertheless importun'd 
and awak'd at length by unusual clamours of the People, he summons a 
general Council, to provide some better means then heretofore had been 
us'd against these continual annoyances from the North.  Wherein by 
advice of all it was determin'd, that the Saxons be invited into Britain 
against the Scots and Picts; whose breaking in they either shortly 
expected, or already found they had not strength enough to oppose.  The 
Saxons were a barbarous and heathen Nation, famous for nothing else but 
Robberies and Cruelties done to all their Neighbours, both by Sea and 
Land; in particular to this Island, witness that military Force, which 
the Roman Emperors maintain'd here purposely against them, under a 
special Commander, whose title, as is found on good record, was Count of 
the Saxon shore in Britain;41. and the many mischiefs done by their 
landing here, both alone and with the Picts, as above hath been related, 
witness as much.  They were a People thought by good Writers,42. to be 
descended of the Sac[ae], a kind of Scythian in the North of Asia, thence 
call'd Sacasons , or Sons of Sac[ae], who with a Flood of other Northern 
Nations came into Europe, toward the declining of the Roman Empire; and 
using Piracy from Denmark all along these Seas, possess'd at length by 
intrusion all that Coast of Germany, and the Netherlands,43. which from 
thence North as far as Eidora, the River bounding Holsatia, though not 
so firmly, or so largely, but that their multitude wander'd yet 
uncertain of Habitation.  Such Guests as these the Britains resolve now 
to send for, and entreat into their Houses and Possessions, at whose 
very name heretofore they trembled afar off.  So much do men through 
impatience count ever that the heaviest which they bear at present, and 
to remove the evil which they suffer, care not to pull on a greater; as 
if variety and change in evil also were acceptable.  Or whether it be 
that men in the despair of better, imagine fondly a kind of refuge from 
one misery to another.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The Britains therfore with Vortigern,44. who was then accounted 
King over them all,45. resolve in full Council to send Embassadors of 
their choicest men with great Gifts, and saith a Saxon Writer in these 
words, desiring their aid;46. Worthy Saxons, hearing the fame of your 
prowess, the distressed Britains wearied out, and overprest by a 
continual invading Enemy, have sent us to beseech your aid.  They have a 
Land fertile and spacious, which to your commands they bid us surrender.  
Heretofore we have liv'd with freedom, under the obedience and 
protection of the Roman Empire.  Next to them we know none worthier then 
your selves; and therefore become suppliants to your Valour.  Leave us 
not below our present Enemies, and to aught by you impos'd, willingly we 
shall submit.  Yet Ethelwerd writes not that they promis'd Subjection, 
but only Amity and League.  They therfore who had chief Rule among them, 
hearing themselves entreated by the Britains,47. to that which gladly 
they would have wish'd to obtain of them by entreating, to the British 
Embassy return this answer:48. Be assur'd henceforth of the Saxons, as 
of faithful Friends to the Britains, no less ready to stand by them in 
their need, then in their best of fortune.  The Embassadors return 
joyful, and with news as welcome to their Country, whose sinister fate 
had now blinded them for destruction.49.  The Saxons, consulting first 
their Gods (for they had answer, that the Land wherto they went, they 
should hold 300 years, half that time conquering, and half quietly 
possessing)50. furnish out three long Galleys, or Kyules, with a chosen 
company of warlike Youth, under the conduct of two Brothers, Hengist and 
Horsa, descended in the fourth degree from Woden; of whom, deify'd for 
the fame of his Acts, most Kings of those Nations derive their Pedigree.  
These, and either mixt with these, or soon after by themselves, two 
other Tribes, or neighbouring People, Jutes and Angles, the one from 
Jutland, the other from Anglen by the City of Sleswick, both Provinces 
of Denmark, arrive in the first year of Martian the Greek Emperor, from 
the Birth of Christ 450,51. receiv'd with much good-will of the People 
first, then of the King,52. who after some assurances given and taken, 
bestows on them the Isle of Tanet, 53.  where they first landed, hoping 
they might be made hereby more eager against the Picts, when they fought 
as for their own Country, and more loyal to the Britains, from whom they 
had receiv'd a place to dwell in, which before they wanted.  The British 
Nennius writes, that these Brethren were driven into Exile out of 
Germany, and to Vortigern who reign'd in much fear, one while of the 
Picts, then of the Romans and Ambrosius, came opportunely into the 
Haven.54.  For it was the custom in old Saxony when their numerous Off-
spring overflow'd the narrowness of their bounds, to send them out by 
lot into new Dwellings wherever they found room, either vacant or to be 
forced.  But whether sought, or unsought, they dwelt not here long 
without Employment.55.  For the Scots and Picts were now come down, some 
say, as far as Stamford, in Lincolnshire, whom, perhaps not imagining to 
meet new opposition, the Saxons, though not till after a sharp 
Encounter, put to flight;56. and that more then once;57. slaying in 
fight, as some Scotch  Writers affirm, their King Eugenius the Son of 
Fergus.58.  Hengist perceiving the Island to be rich and fruitful, but 
her Princes and other Inhabitants given to vicious ease, sends word 
home, inviting others to a share of his good Success.  Who returning 
with 17 Ships, were grown up now to a sufficient Army, and entertain'd 
without suspicion on these terms, that they should bear the brunt of War 
against the Picts, receiving stipend and some place to inhabit.  With 
these was brought over the Daughter of Hengist, a Virgin wondrous fair, 
as is reported, Rowen the British call her: she by commandment of her 
Father, who had invited the King to a Banquet, coming in presence with a 
Bowl of Wine to welcome him, and to attend on his Cup till the Feast 
ended, won so much upon his fancy, though already wiv'd, as to demand 
her in marriage upon any Conditions.  Hengist at first, though it fell 
out perhaps according to his drift, held off, excusing his meanness; 
then obscurely intimating a desire and almost a necessity, by reason of 
his augmented numbers, to have his narrow bounds of Tanet enlarg'd to 
the Circuit of Kent, had it straight by Donation; though Guorangonus 
till then, was King of that place; and so, as it were overcome by the 
great munificence of Vortigern, gave his Daughter.  And still 
encroaching on the King's Favour, got further leave to call over Octa 
and Ebissa, his own and his Brother's Son; pretending that they, if the 
North were given them, would sit there as a continual defence against 
the Scots, while himself guarded the East.59.  They therfore sailing 
with forty Ships, even to the Orcades, and every way curbing the Scots 
and Picts, possess'd that part of the Isle which is now Northumberland.  
Notwithstanding this they complain that their monthly Pay was grown much 
into Arrear; which when the Britains found means to satisfy, though 
alledging withal that they to whom promise was made of Wages, were 
nothing so many in number: quieted with this a while, but still seeking 
occasion to fall off, they find fault next, that their Pay is too small 
for the danger they undergo, threatening open War unless it be 
augmented.  Guortimer, the King's Son, perceiving his Father and the 
Kingdom thus betray'd, from that time bends his utmost endeavour to 
drive them out.  They on the other side making League with the Picts and 
Scots, and issuing out of Kent, wasted without resistance almost the 
whole Land even to the Western Sea, with such a horrid devastation, that 
Towns and Colonies overturn'd, Priests and People slain, Temples and 
Palaces, what with Fire and Sword, lay altogether heap'd in one mix'd 
ruin.  Of all which multitude, so great was the sinfulness that brought 
this upon them, Gildas adds, that few or none were likely to be other 
then lewd and wicked Persons.  The residue of these, part overtaken in 
the Mountains were slain; others subdu'd with Hunger preferr'd slavery 
before instant Death; some getting to Rocks, Hills, and Woods 
inaccessible, preferr'd the fear and danger of any Death, before the 
shame of a secure Slavery; many fled over Sea into other Countries;60. 
some into Holland, where yet remain the ruins of Brittenburgh, an old 
Castle on the Sea, to be seen at low Water not far from Leyden, either 
built, as Writers of their own affirm, or seiz'd on by those Britains, 
in their escape from Hengist:61. Others into Armorica, peopl'd, as some 
think, with Britains long before, either by gift of Constantine the 
Great, or else of Maximus to those British Forces which had serv'd them 
in foreigh Wars, to whom those also that miscarried not with the latter 
Constantine at Arles;62. and lastly, these Exiles driven out by Saxons, 
fled for Refuge.  But the ancient Chronicles of those Provinces attest 
their coming thither to be then first when they fled the Saxons, and 
indeed the name of Britain in France is not read till after that time.  
Yet how a sort of Fugitives, who had quitted without stroke, their own 
Country, should so soon win another, appears not, unless join'd to some 
party of their own settled there before.63.  Vortigern nothing better'd 
by these Calamities,64. grew at last so obdurate as to commit incest 
with his Daughter, tempted or tempting him out of an ambition to the 
Crown.  For which being censur'd and condemn'd in a great Synod of 
Clercs, and Laics, and partly for fear of the Saxons, according to the 
Counsel of his Peers, he retir'd into Wales, and built him there a 
strong Castle in Radnorshire, by the advice of Ambrosius a young 
Prophet, whom others call Merlin.65.  Nevertheless Faustus, who was the 
Son then incestuously begotten, under the instructions of German, or 
some of his Disciples, for German was dead before, prov'd a religious 
man, and liv'd in devotion by the River Remnis, in Glamorganshire.66.  
But the Saxons, though finding it so easy to subdue the Isle, with most 
of their Forces, uncertain for what cause, return'd home: whenas the 
easiness of their Conquest might seem rather likely to have call'd in 
more; which makes more probable that which the British write of 
Guortemir.67.  For he coming to reign, instead of his Father depos'd for 
Incest, is said to have thrice driven and besieged the Saxons in the 
Isle of Tanet; and when they issu'd out with powerful Supplies sent from 
Saxony, to have fought with them four other Battels, wherof three are 
named; the first on the River Darwent, the second at Episford, wherin 
Horsa the Brother of Hengist fell, and on the British part Catigern the 
other Son of Vortigern.  The third in a Field by Stonar, then call'd 
Lapis tituli, in Tanet, where he beat them into their Ships that bore 
them home, glad to have so 'scap'd, and not venturing to land again for 
five years after.  In the space wherof Guortemir dying, commanded they 
should bury him in the Port of Stonar; perswaded that his Bones lying 
there would be terror enough to keep the Saxons from ever landing in 
that place: they, saith Ninnius, neglecting his command, buried him in 
Lincoln.68.  But concerning these times, ancientest Annals of the Saxons 
relate in this manner.69.  In the year 455 Hengist and Horsa fought 
against Vortigern, in a place call'd Eglesthrip, now Ailsfor in Kent, 
where Horsa lost his Life, of whom Horsted, the place of his burial, 
took name.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">After this first Battel and the Death of his Brother, Hengist with 
his Son Esca took on him Kingly Title, and peopl'd Kent with Jutes;70. 
who also then, or not long after, possess'd the Isle of Wight, and part 
of Hampshire lying opposite.71.  Two years after in a fight at 
Creganford, or Craford, Hengist and his Son slew of the Britains four 
chief Commanders, and as many thousand men: the rest in great disorder 
flying to London, with the total loss of Kent.  And eight years passing 
between, he made new War on the Britains;72. of whom in a Battel at 
Wippeds-fleot, twelve Princes were slain, and Wipped the Saxon Earl, who 
left his name to that place, though not sufficient to direct us where it 
now stands.73.   His last encounter was at a place not mention'd, where 
he gave them such an overthrow, that flying in great fear they left the 
spoil of all to their Enemies.  And these perhaps are the four Battels, 
according to Nennius, fought by Guortemir, though by these Writers far 
differently related; and happening besides many other bickerings, in the 
space of 20 years, as Malmsbury reckons.  Nevertheless it plainly 
appears that the Saxons, by whomsoever, were put to hard shifts, being 
all this while fought withal in Kent, their own allotted dwelling, and 
sometimes on the very edge of the Sea, which the word Wippeds-fleot 
seems to intimate.74.  But Guortemir now dead, and none of Courage left 
to defend the Land, Vortigern either by the power of his Faction, or by 
consent of all reassumes the Government: and Hengist thus rid of his 
grand opposer, hearing gladly the restorement of his old favourer, 
returns again with great forces; but to Vortigern whom he well knew how 
to handle without warring, as to his Son-in-law, now that the only 
Author of dissension between them was remov'd by death, offers nothing 
but all terms of new League and Amity.  The King, both for his Wife's 
sake and his own sottishness, consulting also with his Peers not unlike 
himself, readily yields; and the place of Parly is agreed on; to which 
either side was to repair without Weapons.  Hengist, whose meaning was 
not Peace, but Treachery, appointed his men to be secretly arm'd, and 
acquainted them to what intent.  The Watch-word was, Nemet eour Saxes, 
that is, Draw your Daggers;75. which they observing, when the Britains 
were throughly heated with Wine (for the Treaty it seems was not without 
Cups) and provok'd, as was plotted, by some Affront, dispatch'd with 
those Poniards every one his next man, to the number of 300, the chief 
of those that could do aught against him, either in Counsel or in Field.  
Vortigern they only bound and kept in custody, until he granted them for 
his ransom three Provinces, which were called afterward Essex, Sussex, 
and Middlesex.  Who thus dismist, retiring again to his solitary abode 
in the Country of Guorthigirniaun, so call'd by his name, from thence to 
the Castle of his own building in North-Wales, by the River Tiebi; and 
living there obscurely among his Wives, was at length burnt in his Tower 
by Fire from Heaven, at the Prayer, as some say, of German, but that 
coheres not;76. as others, by Ambrosius Aureolian;77. of whom as we have 
heard at first, he stood in great fear, and partly for that cause 
invited in the Saxons.78.  Who, whether by constraint, or of their own 
accord, after much mischief done, most of them returning back into their 
own Country, left a fair opportunity to the Britains of avenging 
themselves easier on those who staid behind.  Repenting therfore, and 
with earnest supplication imploring divine help to prevent their final 
rooting out, they gather from all parts, and under the leading of 
Ambrosius Aurelianus, a vertuous and modest man, the last here of the 
Roman Stock, advancing now onward against the late Victors, defeat them 
in a memorable Battel.  Common opinion, but grounded chiefly on the 
British Fables, makes this Ambrosius to be a younger Son of that 
Constantine, whose eldest, as we heard, was Constance the Monk; who both 
lost their Lives abroad, usurping the Empire.  But the express words 
both of Gildas and Bede assure us, that the Parents of this Ambrosius 
having here born regal Dignity, were slain in these Pictish Wars and 
Commotions in the Island.  And if the fear of Ambrose induc'd Vortigern 
to call in the Saxons, it seems Vortigern usurp'd his Right.  I perceive 
not that Nennius makes any difference between him and Merlin; for that 
Child without Father that prophesy'd to Vortigern, he names not Merlin, 
but Ambrose, makes him the Son of a Roman Consul; but conceal'd by his 
Mother, as fearing that the King therfore sought his Life: yet the Youth 
no sooner had confess'd his Parentage, but Vortigern either in reward of 
his Predictions, or as his Right, bestow'd upon him all the West of 
Britain; himself retiring to a solitary Life.79.  Whose-ever Son he was, 
he was the first according to surest Authors, that led against the 
Saxons, and overthrew them; but whether before this time or after, none 
have written.  This is certain, that in a time when most of the Saxon 
Forces were departed home, the Britains gather'd strength; and either 
against those who were left remaining, or against their whole Powers, 
the second time returning obtain'd this Victory.  Thus Ambrose as chief 
Monarch of the Isle succeeded Vortigern; to whose third Son Pascentius 
he permitted the rule of two Regions in Wales, Buelth and 
Guorthigirniaun.80.  In his days, saith Nennius, the Saxons prevail'd 
not much: against whom Arthur, as being then Chief General for the 
British Kings, made great War, but more renown'd in Songs and Romances, 
then in true stories.  And the sequel itself declares as much.  For in 
the year 477,81. Ella the Saxon, with his three Sons, Cymen, Pleting, 
and Cissa, at a place in Sussex call'd Cymenshore,82. arrive in three 
Ships, kill many of the Britains,83. chasing them that remain'd into the 
Wood Andreds Leage.84.  Another Battel was fought at Mercreds-
Burnamsted,85. wherin Ella had by far the Victory; but Huntingdon makes 
it so doubtful,86. that the Saxons were constrain'd to send home for 
supplies.  Four years after died Hengist, the first Saxon King of 
Kent;87. noted to have attain'd that Dignity by craft,88. as much as 
Valour, and giving scope to his own cruel nature, rather then proceeding 
by Mildness or Civility.89.  His Son Oeric, surnam'd Oisc, of whom the 
Kentish Kings were call'd Oiscings, succeeded him, and sate content with 
his Father's winnings, more desirous to settle and defend, then to 
enlarge his Bounds: he reign'd 24 years.90.  By this time Ella and his 
Son Cissa besieging Andredchester, suppos'd now to be Newenden in 
Kent,91. take it by force, and all within it put to the Sword.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Thus Ella three years after the death of Hengist, began his 
Kingdom of the South-Saxons;92. peopling it with new Inhabitants, from 
the Country which was then old Saxony, at this day Holstein in Denmark, 
and had besides at his command all those Provinces which the Saxons had 
won on this side Humber.93.  Animated with these good Successes, as if 
Britain were become now the field of Fortune, Kerdic another Saxon 
Prince, the tenth by Lineage from Woden,94. an old and practis'd 
Soldier, who in many prosperous Conflicts against the Enemy in those 
parts, had nurs'd up a Spirit too big to live at home with Equals, 
coming to a certain place which from thence took the name of Kerdic-
shore,95. with five ships, and Kenric his Son, the very same day 
overthrew the Britains that oppos'd him; and so effectually, that 
smaller Skirmishes after that day were sufficient to drive them still 
further off, leaving him a large Territory.96.   After him Porta another 
Saxon,97. with his two Sons Bida and Megla, in two Ships arrive at 
Portsmouth thence call'd,98. and at their landing slew a young British 
Nobleman, with many others who unadvisedly set upon them.99.  The 
Britains to recover what they had lost, draw together all their Forces 
led by Natanleod, or Nazaleod, a certain King in Britain,100. and the 
greatest, saith one;101. but with him 5000 of his Men Kerdic puts to 
rout and slays.102.  From whence the place in Hantshire, as far as 
Kerdicsford,103. now Chardford, was call'd of old Nazaleod.104.  Who 
this King should be, hath bred much question; some think it to be the 
British name Ambrose; others to be the right name of his Brother, who 
for the terror of his eagerness in fight, became more known by the 
Surname of Uther, which in the Welsh Tongue signifies Dreadful.  And if 
ever such a King in Britain there were as Uther Pendragon, for so also 
the Monmouth Book surnames him, this in all likelihood must be he.  
Kerdic by so great a blow given to the Britains had made large room 
about him; not only for the Men he brought with him, but for such also 
of his Friends, as he desir'd to make great; for which cause, and withal 
the more to strengthen himself, his two Nephews Stuff and Withgar,105. 
in three Vessels bring him new Levies to Kerdic Shores.106.  Who, that 
they might not come sluggishly to possess what others had won for them, 
either by their own seeking, or by appointment, are set in place where 
they could not but at their first coming give proof of themselves upon 
the Enemy; and so well they did it, that the Britains after a hard 
encounter left them Masters of the Field.107.  About the same time, Ella 
the first South-Saxon King died; whom Cissa, his youngest, succeeded; 
the other two failing before him.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Nor can it be much more or less then about this time, for it was 
before the West-Saxon Kingdom,108. that Uffa the 8th from Woden, made 
himself King of the East-Angles; who by their name testify the Country 
above-mention'd;109. from thence they came in such multitudes, that 
their native Soil is said to have remain'd in the days of Beda 
uninhabited.110.  Huntingdon defers the time of their coming in to the 
ninth year of Kerdic's Reign:111. for, saith he, at first many of them 
strove for Principality, seizing every one his Province, and for some 
while so continu'd, making petty Wars among themselves; till in the end 
Uffa, of whom those Kings were call'd Uffings, over-topt them all in the 
year 571;112. then Titilus his Son, the Father of Redwald, who became 
potent.113. 
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">And not much after the East-Angles, began also the East-Saxons to 
erect a Kingdom under Sleda,114. the tenth from Woden.   But Huntingdon, 
as before, will have it later by 11 years, and Erchenwin to be the first 
King.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Kerdic the same in power,115. though not so fond of Title, forbore 
the name 24 Years after his arrival; but then founded so firmly the 
Kingdom of West-Saxons,116. that it subjected all the rest at length, 
and became the sole Monarchy of England.117.  The same year118. he had a 
Victory against the Britains at Kerdic's Ford, by the River Aven: and 
after eight years, another great fight at Kerdic's Leage, but which won 
the day is not by any set down.  Hitherto hath been collected what there 
is of certainty with circumstance of time and place to be found 
register'd, and no more then barely register'd in Annals of best note; 
without describing after Huntingdon the manner of those Battels and 
Encounters, which they who compare, and can judge of Books, may be 
confident he never found in any current Author whom he had to follow.  
But this Disease hath been incident to many more Historians: and the Age 
wherof we now write, hath had the ill hap, more then any since the first 
fabulous times, to be surcharg'd with all the idle fancies of Posterity.  
Yet that we may not rely altogether on Saxon Relaters, Gildas in 
antiquity far before these, and every way more credible, speaks of these 
Wars in such a manner, though nothing conceited of the British Valour, 
as declares the Saxons in his time and before to have been foil'd not 
seldomer then the Britains.  For besides that first Victory of Ambrose, 
and the interchangeable Success long after, he tells that the last 
overthrow which they receiv'd at Badon Hill was not the least; which 
they in their oldest Annals mention not at all.  And because the time of 
this Battel, by any who could do more then guess, is not set down, or 
any Foundation given from whence to draw a solid compute, it cannot be 
much wide to insert it in this place.  For such Authors as we have to 
follow, give the Conduct and Praise of this Exploit to Arthur; and that 
this was the last of twelve great Battels which he fought victoriously 
against the Saxons.  The several places written by Nennius in their 
Welch Names, were many hundred years ago unknown, and so here 
omitted.119.  But who Arthur was, and whether ever any such reign'd in 
Britain, hath been doubted heretofore, and may again with good reason.  
For the Monk of Malmsbury, and others, whose credit hath sway'd most 
with the learneder sort, we may well perceive to have known no more of 
this Arthur 500 years past, nor of his doings, then we, now living; and 
what they had to say, transcrib'd out of Nennius, a very trivial Writer 
yet extant, which hath already bin related; or out of a British Book, 
the same which he of Monmouth set forth, utterly unknown to the World, 
till more then 600 Years after the days of Arthur, of whom (as Sigebert 
in his Chronicle confesses) all other Histories were silent, both 
Foreign and Domestic, except only that fabulous Book.  Others of later 
time have sought to assert him by old Legends and Cathedral Regests.  
But he who can accept of Legends for good Story, may quickly swell a 
Volume with Trash, and had need be furnish'd with two only Necessaries, 
Leisure and Belief; whether it be the Writer, or he that shall read.  As 
to Arthur, no less is in doubt who was his Father; for if it be true, as 
Nennius or his Notist avers, that Arthur was call'd Mab-Uther, that is 
to say, a cruel Son, for the fierceness that Men saw in him of a Child, 
and the intent of his Name Arturus imports as much, it might well be 
that some in After-ages who sought to turn him into a Fable, wrested the 
word Uther into a proper Name, and so feign'd him the Son of Uther; 
since we read not in any certain Story, that ever such Person liv'd till 
Geoffrey of Monmouth set him off with the Surname of Pendragon.  And as 
we doubted of his Parentage, so may we also of his Puissance; for 
whether that Victory at Badon Hill were his or no, is uncertain; Gildas 
not naming him, as he did Ambrose in the former.  Next, if it be true as 
Caradoc relates,120. that Melvas, King of that Country which is now 
Somerset, kept from him Gueniver his Wife a whole Year in the Town of 
Glaston,121. and restor'd her at the entreaty of Gildas,122. rather then 
for any enforcement that Arthur with all his Chivalry could make against 
a small Town defended only by a moory situation; had either his 
knowledge in War, or the force he had to make, been answerable to the 
fame they bear, that petty King had neither dar'd such affronts nor he 
been so long, and at last without effect, in revenging it.  Considering 
lastly how the Saxons pain'd upon him every where all the time of his 
suppos'd Reign, which began, as some write, in the tenth year of Kerdic,  
who wrung from him by long War the Countries of Somerset and 
Hampshire;123. there will remain neither place nor circumstance in 
story, which may administer any likelihood of those great Acts that are 
ascrib'd him.124.  This only is alledg'd by Nennius in Arthur's 
behalf,125. that the Saxons tho' vanquished never so oft, grew still 
more numerous upon him by continual Supplies out of Germany.126.  And 
the truth is, that Valour may be overtoil'd, and overcome at last with 
endless overcoming.  But as for this Battel of Mount Badon, where the 
Saxons were hemm'd in, or besieg'd, whether by Arthur won, or 
whensoever, it seems indeed to have given a most undoubted and important 
blow to the Saxons, and to have stopped their proceedings for a good 
while after.  Gildas himself witnessing that the Britains having thus 
compell'd them to sit down with Peace, fell therupon to civil discord 
among themselves.  Which words may seem to let in some light toward the 
searching out when this Battel was fought.  And we shall find no time 
since the first Saxon War, from whence a longer Peace ensu'd, then from 
the fight at Kerdic's Leage, in the year 527, which all the Chronicles 
mention, without Victory to Kerdic; and give us argument from the custom 
they have of magnifying their own deeds upon all occasions, to presume 
there his ill speeding.  And if we look still onward, even to the 44th 
year after, wherin Gildas wrote, if his obscure utterance be understood, 
we shall meet with very little war between the Britains and Saxons.127.  
This only remains difficult, that the Victory first won by Ambrose, was 
not so long before this at Badon Siege, but that the same Men living 
might be eye-witness of both; and by this rate hardly can the latter be 
thought won by Arthur, unless we reckon him a grown youth at least in 
the days of Ambrose, and much more then a youth, if Malmsbury be heard, 
who affirms all the Exploits of Ambrose to have been done chiefly by 
Arthur as his General, which will add much Unbelief to the common 
Assertion of his reigning after Ambrose and Uther, especially the fight 
at Badon, being the last of his twelve Battels.  But to prove by that 
which follows, that the fight at Kerdic's Leage, though it differ in 
name from that of Badon, may be thought the same by all effects; Kerdic 
three years after,128. not proceeding onward, as his manner was, on the 
Continent, turns back his Forces on the Isle of Wight;129. which, with 
the slaying of a few only in Withgarburgh, he soon masters; and not long 
surviving, left it to his Nephews by the Mother's side, Stuff and 
Withgar:130. the rest of what he had subdu'd, Kenric his Son held; and 
reign'd 26 Years, in whose tenth Year Withgar war buried in the Town of 
that Island which bore his Name.131.  Notwithstanding all these 
unlikelihoods of Arthur's Reign and great Atchievements, in a Narration 
crept in I know not how among the Laws of Edward the Confessor, Arthur 
the famous King of Britains, is said not only to have expell'd hence the 
Saracens, who were not then known in Europe, but to have conquer'd 
Friesland, and all the North-east Isles as far as Russia, to have made 
Lapland the Eastern Bound of his Empire, and Norway the Chamber of 
Britain.  When should this be done? from the Saxons, till after twelve 
Battels, he had no rest at home; after those, the Britains contented 
with the quiet they had from their Saxon Enemies, were so far from 
seeking Conquests abroad, that by report of Gildas above cited, they 
fell to civil Wars at home.  Surely Arthur much better had made War in 
old Saxony, to repress their flowing hither, then to have won Kingdoms 
as far as Russia, scarce able here to defend his own.  Buchanan our 
Neighbour Historian reprehends him of Monmouth, and others, for fabling 
in the Deeds of Arthur;  yet what he writes therof himself, as of better 
credit, shews not whence he had but from those Fables; which he seems 
content to believe in part, on condition that the Scots and Picts may be 
thought to have assisted Arthur in all his Wars, and Atchievements; 
wherof appears as little ground by any credible Story, as of that which 
he most counts fabulous.  But not further to contest about such 
Uncertainties.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">In the Year 547,132. Ida the Saxon, sprung also from Woden in the 
tenth Degree, began the Kingdom of Bernicia in Northumberland; built the 
Town Bebenburgh, which was after wall'd; and had twelve Sons, half by 
Wives, and half by Concubines.133.  Hengist by leave of Vortigern, we 
may remember, had sent Octave and Ebissa, to seek them Seats in the 
North,134. and there, by warring on the Picts, to secure the Southern 
parts.135.  Which they so prudently effected, that what by force and 
fair proceeding, they well quieted those Countries; and though so far 
distant from Kent, nor without Power in their hands, yet kept themselves 
nigh 180 Years within moderation; and, as inferior Governors, they and 
their Off-spring gave obedience to the Kings of Kent, as to the elder 
Family.  Till at length following the Example of that Age, when no less 
then Kingdoms were the prize of every fortunate Commander, they thought 
it but reason, as well as others of their Nation, to assume Royalty.  Of 
whom Ida was the first,137. a Man in the prime of his Years, and of 
Parentage as we heard; but how he came to wear the Crown, aspiring or by 
free choice, is not said.  Certain enough it is, that his Vertues made 
him not less noble then his Birth, in War undaunted, and unfoil'd; in 
Peace tempering the awe of Magistracy with a natural mildness, he 
reign'd about 12 Years.138.  In the mean while Kenric in a fight at 
Searesbirig,139. now Salisbury, kill'd and put to flight many of the 
Britains; and the fourth year after at Beranvirig,140. now Banbury, as 
some think, with Keaulin his Son, put them again to flight.141.  Keaulin 
shortly after succeeded his Father in the West-Saxons.  And Alla 
descended also of Woden, but by another Line, set up a second Kingdom in 
Deira, the South part of Northumberland, and held it 30 Years;142. while 
Adda, the Son of Ida, and five more after him reign'd without other 
memory in Bernicia:143. And in Kent, Ethelbert the next Year began.144.  
But Esca the Son of Hengist had left Otha, and he Emeric to rule after 
him; both which, without adding to their Bounds, kept what they had in 
peace 63 Years.  But Ethelbert in length of Reign equal'd both his 
Progenitors, and as Beda counts, three Years exceeded.145.  Young at his 
first entrance, and unexperienc'd, he was the first raiser of Civil War 
among the Saxons; claiming from the priority of time wherin Hengist took 
possession here, a kind of Right over the later Kingdoms; and thereupon 
was troublesome to their Confines: but by them twice defeated, he who 
but now thought to seem dreadful, became almost contemptible.146.  For 
Keaulin and Cutha his Son, pursuing him into his own Territory, slew 
there in Battel,147. at Wibbandun, two of his Earls, Oslac and Cnebban.  
By this means the Britains, but chiefly by this Victory at Badon, for 
the space of 44 Years, ending in 571, receiv'd no great Annoyance from 
the Saxons: But the Peace they enjoy'd, by ill using it, prov'd more 
destructive to them then War.  For being rais'd on a sudden by two such 
eminent Successes, from the lowest condition of Thraldom, they whose 
Eyes had beheld both those Deliverances, that by Ambrose, and this at 
Badon, were taught by their experience of either Fortune, both Kings, 
Magistrates, Priests, and private Men, to live orderly.148.  But when 
the next Age, unacquainted with past Evils, and only sensible of their 
present ease and quiet, succeeded, straight follow'd the apparent 
subversion of all Truth, and Justice, in the minds of most Men: scarce 
the least footstep, or impression of Goodness left remaining through all 
Ranks and Degrees in the Land; except in some so very few, as to be 
hardly visible in a general Corruption: which grew in short space not 
only manifest, but odious to all the Neighbour Nations.  And first their 
Kings, among  whom also the Sons or Grand-children of Ambrose, were 
foully degenerated to all Tyranny and vicious Life.  Wherof to hear some 
Particulars out of Gildas, will not be impertinent.  They avenge, saith 
he, and they protect; not the Innocent, but the Guilty: They swear oft, 
but perjure; they wage War, but civil andunjust War.  They punish 
rigorously them that rob by the High-way; but those Grand Robbers that 
fit with them at Table, they honour and reward.  They give Alms largely, 
but in the face of their Alms deeds, pile up Wickedness to a far higher 
heap.  They sit in the Seat of Judgment, but go seldom by the Rule of 
Right; neglecting and proudly overlooking the modest and harmless, but 
countenancing the audacious, though guilty of abominablest Crimes; they 
stuff their Prisons, but with Men committed rather by Circumvention then 
any just Cause.  Nothing better were the Clergy, but at the same pass, 
or rather worse then when the Saxons came first in; unlearned, 
unapprehensive, yet impudent; subtle Prowlers, Pastors in Name, but 
indeed Wolves; intent upon all occasions, not to feed the Flock, but to 
pamper and well-line themselves: not call'd but seizing on the Ministry 
as a Trade not as a spiritual Charge; teaching the People not by sound 
Doctrine, but by evil Example; usurping the Chair of Peace, but through 
the blindness of their own worldly Lusts, they stumble upon the Seat of 
Judas; deadly haters of Truth, broachers of Lyes; looking on the poor 
Christian with eyes of Pride and Contempt; but fawning on the wickedest 
rich Men without shame: great promoters of other mens Alms, with their 
set Exhortations; but themselves contributing ever least: slightly 
touching the many Vices of the Age, but preaching without end their own 
Grievances, as done to Christ; seeking after Preferments and Degrees in 
the Church, more then after Heaven; and so gain'd, make it their whole 
study how to keep them by any Tyranny.  Yet lest they should be thought 
things of no use in their eminent Places, they have their Niceties and 
trivial Points to keep in awe the superstitious Multitude; but in true 
saving Knowledge leave them still as gross and stupid as themselves; 
bunglers at the Scripture, nay, forbidding and silencing them that know; 
but in worldly Matters, practis'd and cunning Shifters; in that only Art 
and Simony, great Clerks and Masters, bearing their heads high, but 
their thoughts abject and low.  He taxes them also as gluttonous, 
incontinent, and daily Drunkards.  And what shouldst thou expect from 
these, poor Laity, so he goes on, these Beasts, all Belly?  Shall these 
amend thee, who are themselves laborious in evil doings?  Shalt thou see 
with their eyes, who see right forward nothing but Gain?  Leave them 
rather, as bids our Saviour, lest ye fall both blindfold into the same 
Perdition.  Are all thus?  Perhaps not all, or not so grosly.  But what 
avail'd it Eli to be himself blameless, while he conniv'd at others that 
were abominable?  Who of them hath been envy'd for his better Life?  Who 
of them hath hated to consort with these, or withstood their entring the 
Ministry, or endeavour'd zealously their casting out?  Yet some of these 
perhaps by others are legended for great Saints.  This was the state of 
Government, this of Religion among the Britains, in that long calm of 
Peace, which the fight at Badon Hill had brought forth.  Wherby it came 
to pass, that so fair a Victory came to nothing.  Towns and Cities were 
not reinhabited, but lay rein'd and waste; nor was it long ere Domestic 
War breaking out, wasted them more.  For Britain, as at other times, had 
then also several Kings:149. Five of whom Gildas, living then in 
Armorica at a safe distance, boldly reproves by name: First Constantine 
(fabled Son of Cador, Duke of Cornwal, Arthur's Half-Brother, by the 
Mother's side) who then reign'd in Cornwal and Devon, a tyrannical and 
bloody King, polluted also with many Adulteries: He got into his power 
two young Princes of the Blood Royal, uncertain whether before him in 
right, or otherwise suspected; and after solemn Oath given of their 
Safety the Year that Gildas wrote, slew them with their two Governors in 
the Church, and in their Mother's Arms, through the Abbot's Cope which 
he had thrown over them, thinking by the reverence of his Vesture to 
have withheld the Murderer.  These are commonly suppos'd to be the Sons 
of Mordred, Arthur's Nephew, said to have revolted from his Uncle, given 
him in a Battel his Death's Wound, and by him after to have bin slain.  
Which things, were they but true, would much diminish the blame of 
Cruelty in Constantine, revenging Arthur on the Sons of so false a 
Mordred.  In another part, but not express'd where, Aurelius Conanus was 
King: him he charges also with Adulteries, and Parricide; Cruelties 
worse then the former; to be a hater of his Country's Peace, thirsting 
after Civil War and Prey.  His Condition, it seems, was not very 
prosperous, for Gildas wishes him, being now left alone, like a Tree 
withering in the midst of a barren Field, to remember the Vanity and 
Arrogance of his Father, and elder Brethren, who came all in untimely 
Death in their Youth.  The third reigning in Demetia, or South Wales, 
was Vortipor, the Son of a good Father; he was, when Gildas wrote, grown 
old, not in Years only, but in Adulteries; and in governing, full of 
Falshood and cruel Actions.  In his latter days, putting away his Wife, 
who died in Divorce, he became, if we mistake not Gildas, incestuous 
with his Daughter.  The fourth was Cuneglas, imbru'd in Civil War; he 
also had divorc'd his Wife, and taken her Sister, who had vow'd 
Widowhood: he was a great Enemy to the Clergy, high-minded, and trusting 
to his Wealth.  The last, but greatest of all in Power, was Maglocune, 
and greatest also in Wickedness: he had driven out, or slain, many other 
Kings or Tyrants, and was call'd the Island Dragon, perhaps having his 
Seat in Anglesey; a profuse Giver, a great Warrior, and of a goodly 
stature.  While he was yet young, he overthrew his Uncle, though in the 
head of a compleat Army, and took from him the Kingdom: Then touch'd 
with remorse of his doings, not without deliberation, took upon him the 
profession of a Monk; but soon forsook his Vow, and his Wife also; which 
for that Vow he had left, making love to the Wife of his Brother's Son 
then living.  Who not refusing the Offer, if she were not rather the 
first that entic'd, found means both to dispatch her own Husband, and 
the former Wife of Maglocune, to make her Marriage with him the more 
unquestionable.  Neither did he this for want of better Instructions, 
having had the learnedest and wisest Man, reputed of all Britain, the 
instituter of his Youth.  Thus much, the utmost that can be learnt by 
truer story, of what past among the Britains from the time of their 
useless Victory at Badon, to the time that Gildas wrote, that is to say, 
as may be guess'd, from 527 to 571, is here set down altogether; not to 
be reduc'd under any certainty of Years.150.  But now the Saxons, who 
for the most part all this while had been still, unless among 
themselves, began afresh to assault them, and ere long to drive them out 
of all which they yet maintain'd on this side Wales.  For Cuthulf, the 
Brother of Keaulin,151. by a Victory obtain'd at Bedanford, now Bedford, 
took from them four good Towns Liganburgh, Eglesburgh, Bensington now 
Benson in Oxfordshire, and Ignesham;152. but outliv'd not many months 
his good Success.  And after six years more,153. Keaulin, and Cuthwin 
his Son, gave them a great overthrow at Deorrham in Gloucestershire, 
slew three of their Kings, Comail, Condidan, and Farinmaile; and took 
three of their chief Cities, Gloucester, Cirencester, and 
Badencester.154.  The Britains notwithstanding, after some space of 
time, judging to have out-grown their Losses, gather to a head and 
encounter Keaulin, with Cutha his Son, at Fethanleage; whom valiantly 
fighting, they slew among the thickest, and, as is said, forc'd the 
Saxons to retire. 155. But Keaulin reinforcing the Fight, put them to a 
main rout; and following his Advantage, took many Towns, and return'd 
laden with rich Bounty.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The last of those Saxons, who rais'd their own Atchievements to a 
Monarchy, was Crida, much about this time, first Founder of the Mercian 
Kingdom, drawing also his Pedigree from Woden.157.  Of whom all to write 
the several Genealogies,158. though it might be done without long 
search, were in my opinion to encumber the story with a sort of 
barbarous Names, to little purpose.159.  This may suffice that of 
Woden's three Sons, from the eldest issu'd Hengist, and his Succession; 
from the second, the Kings of Mercia;160. from the third, all that 
reign'd in West-Saxony, and most of the Northumbers, of whom Alla was 
one, the first King of Deira; which, after his Death, the Race of Ida 
seiz'd, and made it one Kingdom with Bernicia,161. usurping on the 
Childhood of Edwin, Alla's Son: whom Ethelric the Son of Ida 
expell'd.162.  Notwithstanding others write of him, that from a poor 
Life, and beyond hope in his old Age, coming to the Crown, he could 
hardly, by the Access of a Kingdom, have overcome his former obscurity, 
had not the Fame of his Son preserv'd him.163  Once more the Britains, 
ere they quitted all on this side the Mountains, forgot not to shew some 
Manhood;164. for meeting Keaulin at Woden's Beorth, that is to say at 
Woden's Mount in Wiltshire;165. whether it were by their own Forces, or 
assisted by the Angles,166. whose hatred Keaulin had incur'd,167. they 
ruin'd his whole Army, and chas'd him out of his Kingdom;168. from 
whence flying, he died the next year in poverty,169. who a little before 
was the most potent, and indeed sole King of all the Saxons on this side 
Humber.170.  But who was chief among the Britains in this Exploit, had 
been worth remembring, whether it were Maglocune, of whose Prowess hath 
been spoken, or Teudric King of Glamorgan, whom the Regest of Landaff 
recounts to have been always victorious in fight; to have reign'd about 
this time, and at length to have exchang'd his Crown for an Hermitage; 
till in the aid of his Son Mouric, whom the Saxons had reduc'd to 
extremes, taking Arms again, he defeated them at Tinterne by the River 
Wye; but himself receiv'd a mortal Wound.  The same Year with Keaulin, 
whom Keola the Son of Cuthulf, Keaulin's Brother, succeeded, Crida also 
the Mercian King deceas'd, in whose room Wibba succeeded;171. and in 
Northumberland, Ethelfrid, in the room of Ethelric, reigning 24 Years.  
Thus omitting Fables, we have the view of what with reason can be rely'd 
on for truth, done in Britain since the Romans forsook it.  Wherin we 
have heard the many Miseries and Desolations brought by Divine Hand on a 
perverse Nation; driven, when nothing else would reform them, out of a 
fair Country, into a mountainous and barren Corner, by Strangers and 
Pagans.  So much more tolerable in the eye of Heaven is Infidelity 
profest, then Christian Faith and Religion dishonour'd by unchristian 
Works.  Yet they also at length renounc'd their Heathenism; which how it 
came to pass, will be the matter next related.

THE

HISTORY

OF

B R I T A I N.

------------------------------------------------------------
THE FOURTH BOOK.
------------------------------------------------------------

The Saxons grown up now to seven absolute Kingdoms, and the latest of 
them establish'd by Succession, finding their Power arrive well nigh at 
the utmost of what was to be gain'd upon the Britains, and as little 
fearing to be displanted by them, had time now to survey at leisure one 
another's Greatness.  Which quickly bred among them either Envy or 
mutual Jealousies; till the West Kingdom at length grown over-powerful, 
put an end to all the rest.1.  Mean while, above others, Ethelbert of 
Kent, who by this time had well ripen'd his young Ambition, with more 
Ability of Years and Experience in War, what before he attempted to his 
loss, now successfully attains; and by degrees brought all the other 
Monarchies between Kent and Humber to be at his devotion.  To which 
design the Kingdom of West Saxons, being the firmest of them all, at 
that time sore shaken by their overthrow at Wodens-beorth, and the Death 
of Keaulin, gave him, no doubt, a main advantage; the rest yielded not 
Subjection, but as he earn'd it by continual Victories.2.  And to win 
him the more regard abroad, he marries Bertha the French King's 
Daughter, though a Christian, and with this condition, to have the free 
exercise of her Faith, under the Care and Instruction of Letardus a 
Bishop, sent by her Parents along with her; the King notwithstanding and 
his People retaining their old Religion.3.  Beda out of Gildas lays it 
sadly to the Britains charge, that they never would vouchsafe their 
Saxon Neighbours the means of Conversion;4. but how far to blame they 
were, and what hope there was of converting in the midst of so much 
Hostility, at least Falshood, from their first Arrival, is not now easy 
to determine.5.  Howbeit not long after they had the Christian Faith 
preach'd to them by a more remote, and (as report went, accounted old in 
Beda's time) upon this occasion.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">The Northumbrians had a Custom at that time, and many hundred 
years after not abolish'd, to sell their Children for a small value into 
any foreign Land.  Of which number two comely Youths were brought to 
Rome, whose fair and honest Countenances invited Gregory Arch-deacon of 
that City, among others that beheld them, pitying their condition, to 
demand whence they were; it was answer'd by some who stood by, that they 
were Angli of the Province Deira, Subjects to Alla King of 
Northumberland; and by Religion, Pagans.  Which last Gregory deploring, 
fram'd on a sudden this allusion to the three names he heard; that the 
Angli so like to Angels should be snatch'd de ira, that is, from the 
Wrath of God, to sing Hallelujah: and forthwith obtaining Licence of 
Benedict the Pope, had come and preach'd here among them, had not the 
Roman People, whose Love endur'd not the Absence of so vigilant a Pastor 
over them, recall'd him then on his Journey, though but deferr'd his 
pious Intention.6.  For a while after, succeeding in the Papal Seat, and 
now in his fourth Year, admonish'd, saith Beda, by divine Instinct, he 
sent Augustine, whom he had design'd for Bishop of the English Nation, 
and other zealous Monks with him, to preach to them the Gospel.  Who 
being now on their way, discourag'd by some Reports, or their own carnal 
Fear, sent back Austin, in the name of all, to beseech Gregory they 
might return home, and not be sent a Journey so full of hazard, to a 
fierce and infidel Nation, whose Tongue they understood not.  Gregory 
with pious and Apostolic Persuasions exhorts them not to shrink back 
from so good a Work, but cheerfully to go on in the Strength of Divine 
Assistance.  The Letter itself yet extant among our Writers of 
Ecclesiastic Story, I omit here, as not professing to relate of those 
matters more then what mixes aptly with civil Affairs.  The Abbott 
Austin, for so he was ordain'd over the rest, re-incourag'd by the 
Exhortations of Gregory, and his Fellows by the Letter which he brought 
them, came safe to the Isle of Tanet,7. in number about 40, besides some 
of the French Nation whom they took along as Interpreters.  Ethelbert 
the King, to whom Austin at his landing had sent a new and wondrous 
Message, that he came from Rome to proffer Heaven and eternal Happiness 
in the knowledge of another God then the Saxons knew, appoints them to 
remain where they landed, and Necessaries to be provided them, 
consulting in the mean time what was to be done.  And after certain days 
coming into the Island, chose a place to meet them under the open Sky, 
possest with an old persuasion, that all Spells, if they should use any 
to deceive him, so it were not within doors, would be unavailable.  They 
on the other side call'd to his presence, advancing for their Standard a 
silver Cross, and the painted Image of our Saviour, came slowly forward, 
singing their solemn Litanies: which wrought in Ethelbert more suspicion 
perhaps that they us'd Enchantments; till sitting down as the King 
will'd them, they there preach'd to him and all in that Assembly, the 
tydings of Salvation.  Whom having heard attentively, the King thus 
answer'd: Fair indeed and ample are the Promises which ye bring, and 
such things as have the appearance in them of much good; yet such as 
being new and uncertain, I cannot hastily assent to, quitting the 
Religion which from my Ancestors, with all the English Nation, so many 
years I have retain'd.  Nevertheless because ye are Strangers, and have 
endur'd so long a Journey, to impart us the knowledge of things, which I 
persuade me you believe to be the truest and the best, ye may be sure, 
we shall not recompence you with any Molestation, but shall provide 
rather how we may friendliest entertain ye; nor do we forbid whom ye can 
by preaching gain to your Belief.  And accordingly their Residence he 
allotted them in Doverne or Canterbury his chief City, and made 
provision for their maintenance, with free leave to preach their 
Doctrine where they pleased.  By which, and by the example of their holy 
Life, spent in Prayer, Fasting, and continual Labour in the Conversion 
of Souls, they won many; on whose Bounty and the King's, receiving only 
what was necessary, they subsisted.  There stood without the City on the 
East-side, an ancient Church built in honour of St. Martin, while yet 
the Romans remained here: in which Bertha the Queen went out usually to 
pray:8. Here they also began first to preach, baptize, and openly to 
exercise Divine Worship.  But when the King himself, convinc'd by their 
good Life and Miracles, became Christian, and was baptized, which came 
to pass in the very first Year of their Arrival, then multitudes daily, 
conforming to their Prince, thought it honour to be reckon'd among those 
of his Faith.  To whom Ethelbert  indeed principally shewed his favour, 
but compell'd none.9.  For so he had bin taught by them who were both 
the Instructors and the Authors of his Faith, that Christian Religion 
ought to be voluntary, not compell'd.  About this time Kelwulf the Son 
of Cutha, Keaulin's Brother, reign'd over the West-Saxons, after his 
Brother Keola or Kelric,10. and had continual War either with English, 
Welch, Picts, or Scots.11.  But Austin, whom with his Fellows, Ethelbert 
now had endow'd with a better place for their Abode in the City,12. and 
other Possessions necessary to Livelihood,13. crossing into France, was 
by the Archbishop of Arles, at the appointment of Pope Gregory, ordain'd 
Archbishop of the English; and returning, sent to Rome Laurence and 
Peter, two of his Associates, to acquaint the Pope of his good Success 
in England, and to be resolv'd of certain Theological, or rather 
Levitical Questions: with Answers to which, not proper in this place, 
Gregory sends also to the great Work of Converting, that went on so 
happily, a Supply of Labourers, Mellitus, Justus, Paulinus, Rufinian, 
and many others; who what they were, may be guess'd by the stuff which 
they brought with them, Vessels and Vestments for the Altar, Copes, 
Reliques, and for the Archbishop Austin a Pall to say Mass in: to such a 
rank Superstition that Age was grown, though some of them yet retaining 
an Emulation of Apostolic Zeal.  Lastly, to Ethelbert they brought a 
Letter with many Presents.  Austin thus exalted to Archiepiscopal 
Authority, recover'd from the Ruins and other prophane Uses, a Christian 
Church in Canterbury built of old by the Romans, which he dedicated by 
the name of Christ's Church, and joining to it built a Seat for himself 
and his Successors; a Monastary also near the City Eastward, where 
Ethelbert at his motion built St. Peter's, and enrich'd it with great 
Endowments, to be a place of Burial for the Archbishops and Kings of 
Kent: so quickly they stept up into Fellowship of Pomp with Kings.14.  
While thus Ethelbert and his People had their Minds intent, Ethelfrid 
the Northumbrian King was not less busied in far different Affairs: for 
being altogether warlike, and covetous of Fame, he more wasted the 
Britains then any Saxon King before him; winning from them large 
Territories, which either he made tributary, or planted with his own 
Subjects.15.  Whence Edan King of those Scots that dwelt in Britain, 
jealous of his Successes, came against him with a mighty Army, to a 
place call'd Degsastan; but in the fight losing most of his Men, himself 
with a few escap'd: only Theobald the King's Brother, and the whole Wing 
which he commanded, unfortunately cut off, made the Victory to Ethelfrid 
less intire.  Yet from that time no King of Scots in hostile manner 
durst pass into Britain for a hundred and more Years after: and what 
some Years before Kelwulf the West-Saxon is annal'd to have done against 
the Scots and Picts, passing through the Land of Ethelfrid a King so 
potent, unless in his Aid and Alliance, is not likely.  Buchanan writes 
as if Ethelfrid, assisted by Keaulin whom he mis-titles King of East-
Saxons, had before this time a battel with Aidan, wherin Cutha, 
Keaulin's Son, was slain.  But Cutha, as is above-written from better 
Authority, was slain in fight against the Welch 20 years before.16.  The 
number of Christians began now to increase so fast,17. that Augustin 
ordaining Bishops under him, two of his Assistants Mellitus and Justus, 
sent them out both to the Work of their Ministry.  And Mellitus by 
preaching converted the East-Saxons, over whom Sebert the Son of Sleda, 
by permission of Ethelbert, being born of his Sister Ricula, then 
reign'd.  Whose Conversion Ethelbert to gratulate, built them the great 
Church of St. Paul in London to be their Bishop's Cathedral; as Justus 
also had his built at Rochester, and both gifted by the same King with 
fair Possessions.  Hitherto Austin labour'd well among Infidels, but not 
with like Commendation soon after among Christians.  For by means of 
Ethelbert summoning the Britain Bishops to a place on the edge of 
Worcestershire, call'd from that time Augustin's Oak, he requires them 
to conform with him in the same day of celebrating Easter, and many 
other points wherin they differ'd from the Rites of Rome: which when 
they refus'd to do, not prevailing by Dispute, he appeals to a Miracle, 
restoring to sight a blind Man whom the Britains could not cure.  At 
this something mov'd, though not minded to recede from their own 
Opinions without further Consultation, they request a second meeting: to 
which came seven Britain Bishops, with many other learned Men, 
especially from the famous Monastery of Bangor, in which were said to be 
so many Monks, living all by their own Labour, that being divided under 
seven Rectors, none had fewer then 300.  One Man there was who staid 
behind, a Hermit by the Life he led, who by his Wisdom effected more 
then all the rest, who went: being demanded, for they held him as an 
Oracle, how they might know Austin to be a Man from God, that they might 
follow him, he answer'd, that if they found him meek and humble, they 
should be taught by him, for it was likeliest to be the Yoke of Christ, 
both what he bore himself, and would have them bear; but if he bore 
himself proudly, that they should not regard him, for he was then 
certainly not of God.  They took his Advice, and hasted to the place of 
meeting.  Whom Austin, being already there before them, neither arose to 
meet, nor receiv'd in any brotherly sort, but sat all the while 
pontifically in his Chair.  Wherat the Britains, as they were counsel'd 
by the holy Man, neglected him, and neither hearken'd to his Proposals 
of Conformity, nor would acknowledge him for an Archbishop: And in name 
of the rest, Dinothus, then Abbot of Bangor, is said thus sagely to have 
answer'd him:18. As to the Subjection which you require, be thus 
persuaded of us, that in the bond of Love and Charity we are all 
Subjects and Servants to the Church of God, yea to the Pope of Rome, and 
every good Christian to help them forward, both by Word and Deed, to be 
the Children of God: other obedience then this we know not to be due to 
him whom you term the Pope; and this Obedience we are ready to give both 
to him and to every Christian continually.  Besides, we are govern'd 
under God by the Bishop of Caerleon, who is to oversee us in spiritual 
matters.  To which Austin thus presaging, some say menacing, replies, 
Since ye refuse to accept of Peace with your Brethren, ye shall have War 
from your Enemies; and since ye will not with us preach the Word of Life 
to whom ye ought, from their hands ye shall receive Death.  This, though 
Writers agree not whether Austin spake it as his Prophecy, or as his 
Plot against the Britains, fell out accordingly.  For many years were 
not past,19. when Ethelfrid whether of his own accord, or at the request 
of Ethelbert, incens'd by Austin, with a powerful Host came to 
Westchester, then Caer-legion.20.  Where being met by the British 
Forces,21. and both sides in readiness to give the onset, he discerns a 
Company of Men, not habited for War, standing together in a place of 
some safety; and by them a Squadron arm'd.  Whom having learnt upon some 
enquiry to be Priests and Monks, assembled thither after three days 
fasting, to pray for the good Success of their Forces against him, 
therfore they first, saith he, shall feel our Swords; for they who pray 
against us, fight heaviest against us by their Prayers, and are our 
dangerousest Enemies.  And with that turns his first Charge upon the 
Monks: Brocmail the Captain set to guard them, quickly turns his back, 
and leaves above 1200 Monks to a sudden Massacre, wherof scarce fifty 
escap'd.  But not so easy work found Ethelfrid against another part of 
Britains that stood in arms, whom though at last he overthrew, yet with 
Slaughter nigh as great to his own Soldiers.  To excuse Austin of this 
Bloodshed, lest some might think it his revengeful Policy, Beda writes 
that he was dead long before, although if the time of his sitting 
Archbishop be right computed sixteen years, he must survive this 
Action.22.  Other just ground of charging him with this Imputation 
appears not, save what evidently we have from Geoffrey Monmouth, whose 
weight we know.  The same year23. Kelwulf made war on the South-Saxons, 
bloody, saith Huntingdon, to both sides, but most to them of the South: 
and four years after dying,24. left the Government of West-Saxons to 
Kinegils and Cuichelm, the Sons of his Brother Keola.25.  Others, as 
Florent of Worcester, and Matthew of Westminster, will have Cuichelm Son 
of Kinegils, but admitted to reign with his Father, in whose third 
year26. they are recorded with joint Forces or Conduct to have fought 
against the Britains in Beandune,27. now Bindon in Dorsetshire, and to 
have slain of them above two thousand.  More memorable was the second 
year following,28. by the Death of Ethelbert the first Christian King of 
Saxons,29. and no less a Favourer of all Civility in that rude Age.  He 
gave Laws and Statutes after the example of Roman Emperors, written with 
the Advice of his sagest Counsellors, but in the English Tongue, and 
observ'd long after.  Wherin his special care was to punish those who 
had stolen aught from Church or Churchman, therby shewing how gratefully 
he receiv'd at their hands the Christian Faith.  Which, he no sooner 
dead, but his Son Eadbald took the course as fast to extinguish; not 
only falling back to Heathenism, but that which Heathenism was wont to 
abhor, marrying his Father's second Wife.  Then soon was perceiv'd what 
multitudes for fear or countenance of the King had profess'd 
Christianity, returning now as eagerly to their old Religion.  Nor staid 
the Apostacy within one Province, but quickly spread over to the East-
Saxons; occasion'd there likewise, or set forward by the Death of their 
Christian King Sebert: whose three Sons, of whom two are nam'd Sexted 
and Seward,30. neither in his life-time would be brought to Baptism, and 
after his Decease re-establish'd the free Exercise of Idolatry; nor so 
content, they set themselves in despight to do some open Profanation 
against the other Sacrament.  Coming therfore into the Church where 
Mellitus the Bishop was ministring, they requir'd him in abuse and scorn 
to deliver to them unbaptiz'd the consecrated Bread; and him refusing, 
drove disgracefully out of their Dominion.  Who cross'd forthwith into 
Kent, where things were in the same plight, and thence into France, with 
Justus Bishop of Rochester.  But Divine Vengeance defer'd not long the 
punishment of Men so impious; for Eadbald, vext with an evil Spirit, 
fell often into fouls fits of Distraction; and the Sons of Sebert, in a 
Fight against the West-Saxons, perish'd with their whole Army.  But 
Eadbald, within the year, by an extraordinary means became penitent.  
For when Laurence the Archbishop and Successor of Austin was preparing 
to ship for France, after Justus and Mellitus, the story goes, if it be 
worth believing, that St. Peter, in whose Church he spent the Night 
before in watching and praying, appear'd to him, and to make the Vision 
more sensible, gave him many stripes for offering to desert his Flock; 
at sight wherof the King (to whom next Morning he shew'd the marks of 
what he had suffer'd, by whom and for what cause) relenting and in great 
fear, dissolv'd his incestuous Marriage, and apply'd himself to the 
Christian Faith more sincerely then before, with all his People.  But 
the Londoners addicted still to Paganism, would not be persuaded to 
receive again Mellitus their Bishop, and to compel them was not in his 
power.  Thus much through all the South was troubled in Religion,31. as 
much were the North-parts disquieted through Ambition.  For Ethelfrid of 
Bernicia, as was touch'd before, having thrown Edwin out of Deira, and 
join'd that Kingdom to his own, not content to have bereav'd him of his 
Right, whose known virtues and high parts gave cause of suspicion to his 
Enemies, sends Messengers to demand him of Redwald King of East-Angles; 
under whose Protection, after many years wandering obscurely through all 
the Island, he had plac'd his safety.  Redwald, though having promis'd 
all defence to Edwin as to his suppliant, yet tempted with continual and 
large offers of Gold, and not contemning the puissance of Ethelfrid, 
yielded at length, either to dispatch him, or to give him into their 
hands: but earnestly exhorted by his Wife, not to betray the Faith and 
inviolable Law of Hospitality and Refuge given,32. prefers his first 
promise as the more religious; nor only refuses to deliver him, but 
since War was thereupon denounc'd, determines to be beforehand with the 
danger; and with a sudden Army rais'd, surprises Ethelfrid, little 
dreaming an Invasion, and in a Fight near to the East-side of the River 
Idle, on the Mercian border, now Nottinghamshire, slays him,33. 
dissipating easily those few Forces which he had got to march out over-
hastily with him; who yet as a testimony of his Fortune, not his Valour 
to be blam'd, slew first with his own hands, Reiner the King's Son.  His 
two Sons Oswald and Oswi, by Acca, Edwin's Sister, escap'd into 
Scotland.  By this Victory Redwald became so far superior to the other 
Saxon Kings, that Beda reckons him the next after Ella and Ethelbert; 
who besides this Conquest of the North, had likewise all on the hither 
side Humber at his obedience.34.  He had formerly in Kent receiv'd 
Baptism, but coming home, and persuaded by his Wife, who still it seems 
was his chief Counsellor to good or bad alike, relaps'd into his old 
Religion: yet not willing to forgo his new, thought it not the worst 
way, lest perhaps he might err in either, for more assurance to keep 
them both; and in the same Temple erected one Altar to Christ, another 
to his Idols.  But Edwin, as with more deliberation he undertook, and 
with more sincerity retain'd the Christian Profession, so also in Power 
and extent of Dominion far exceeded all before him; subduing all, saith 
Beda, English or British, even to the Isles, then call'd Mevanian, 
Anglesey, and Man; settled in his Kingdom by Redwald, he sought in 
marriage Edelburga, whom others call Tate, the Daughter of Ethelbert.  
To whose Embassadors Eadbald her Brother made answer, that to wed their 
Daughter to a Pagan, was not the Christian Law.  Edwin reply'd, that to 
her Religion he would be no hindrance, which with her whole Houshold she 
might freely exercise.  And moreover, that if examin'd it were found the 
better, he would embrace it.  These ingenuous offers, opening so fair a 
way to advancement of Truth, are accepted, and Paulinus as a spiritual 
Guardian sent along with the Virgin.35.  He being to that purpose made 
Bishop by Justus, omitted no occasion to plant the Gospel in those 
parts, but with small success, till the next year, Cuichelm, at that 
time one of the two West-Saxon Kings,36. envious of the greatness which 
he saw Edwin growing up to, sent privily Eumerus a hir'd Sword-man to 
assasin him; who under pretence of doing a message from his Master, with 
a poison'd Weapon, stabs at Edwin, conferring with him in his House, by 
the River Derwent in Yorkshire, on an Easter-day; which Lilla one of the 
King's Attendants, at the instant perceiving, with a Loyalty that stood 
not then to deliberate, abandon'd his whole Body to the blow; which not 
withstanding made passage through to the King's person, with a wound not 
to be slighted.  The murderer encompass'd now with Swords, and 
desperate, fore-revenges his own fall with the Death of another, whom 
his Poniard reach'd home.  Paulinus omitting no opportunity to win the 
King from misbelief, obtain'd at length this promise from him; that if 
Christ, whom he so magnify'd, would give him to recover of his wound, 
and victory of his Enemies who had thus assaulted him, he would then 
become Christian, in pledge wherof he gave his young Daughter Eanfled, 
to be bred up in Religion; who with 12 others of his Family, on the day 
of Pentecost was baptiz'd.  And by that time well recover'd of his 
wound, to punish the Authors of so foul a Fact, he went with an Army 
against the West-Saxons: whom having quell'd by War, and of such as had 
conspir'd against him, put some to death, others pardon'd, he return'd 
home victorious, and from that time worship'd no more his Idols, yet 
ventur'd not rashly into Baptism, but first took care to be instructed 
rightly what he learnt, examining and still considering with himself and 
others, whom he held wisest; though Boniface the Pope, by large Letters 
of Exhortation both to him and his Queen, was not wanting to quicken his 
belief.  But while he still defer'd, and his deferring might seem now to 
have pass'd the maturity of Wisdom to a faulty lingring, Paulinus by 
Revelation, as was believ'd, coming to the knowledge of a Secret, which 
befel him strangely in the time of his troubles, on a certain day went 
in boldly to him, and laying his right hand on the head of the King, 
ask'd him if he remember'd what that sign meant; the King trembling, and 
in a maze rising up, streight fell at his feet.  Behold, saith Paulinus, 
raising him from the ground, God hath deliver'd you from your Enemies, 
and given you the Kingdom as you desir'd: perform now what long since 
you promis'd him, to receive his Doctrine, which I now bring you, and 
the Faith, which if you accept, shall to your temporal Felicity, add 
eternal.  The Promise claim'd of him by Paulinus, how and wherfore made, 
though favouring much of Legend, is thus related.  Redwald, as we heard 
before, dazl'd with the Gold of Ethelfrid, or by his threatning over-
aw'd, having promis'd to yield up Edwin, one of his faithful Companions, 
of which he had some few with him in the Court of Redwald, that never 
shrunk from his Adversity, about the first hour of night comes in haste 
to his Chamber, and calling him forth for better secrecy, reveals to him 
his danger, offers him his aid to make escape; but that course not 
approv'd, as seeming dishonourable without more manifest cause to begin 
distrust towards one who had so long been his only refuge, the friend 
departs.  Edwin left alone without the Palace-Gate, full of sadness and 
perplext Thoughts, discerns about the dead of Night, a man neither by 
Countenance nor by Habit to him known, approaching towards him.  Who 
after salutation, ask'd him why at this hour, when all others were at 
rest, he alone so sadly sat waking on a cold stone?  Edwin not a little 
misdoubting who he might be, ask'd him again, what his sitting within 
doors, or without, concern'd him to know?  To whom he again, Think not 
that who thou art, or why sitting here, or what danger hangs over thee, 
is to me unknown: But what would you promise to that man, who ever would 
befriend you out of all these troubles, and persuade Redwald to the 
like?  All that I am able, answer'd Edwin.  And he, what if the same man 
should promise to make you greater then any English King hath been 
before you?  I should not doubt, quoth Edwin, to be answerably grateful.  
And what if to all this he would inform you, said the other, in a way to 
Happiness, beyond what any of your Ancestors hath known?  Would you 
hearken to his Counsel?  Edwin without stopping promis'd he would.  And 
the other laying his right hand on Edwin's Head, When this Sign, saith 
he, shall next befal thee, remember this time of Night, and this 
Discourse, to perform what thou hast promis'd; and with these words 
disappearing, he left Edwin much reviv'd; but not less fill'd with 
wonder, who this unknown should be.  When suddenly the Friend who had 
been gone all this while to listen further what was like to be decreed 
of Edwin, comes back and joyfully bids him rise to his repose, for that 
the King's mind, though for a while drawn aside, was now fully resolv'd 
not only not to betray him, but to defend him against all Enemies, as he 
had promis'd.  This was said to be the cause why Edwin adminish'd by the 
Bishop of a Sign which had befallen him so strangely, and as he thought 
so secretly, arose to him with that reverence and amazement, as to one 
sent from Heaven, to claim that Promise of him which he perceiv'd well 
was due to a Divine Power, that had assisted him in his Troubles.  To 
Paulinus therfore he makes answer, that the Christian Belief he himself 
ought by promise, and intended to receive; but would confer first with 
his chief Peers and Counsellors, that if they likewise could be won, all 
at once might be baptiz'd.  They therfore being ask'd in Council what 
their opinion was concerning the new Doctrine, and well perceiving what 
way the King inclin'd, every one therafter shape'd his Reply.  The Chief 
Priest speaking first, discover'd an old grudge he had against his Gods, 
for advancing others in the King's favour above him their Chief Priest: 
another hiding his Court-compliance with a grave Sentence, commended the 
choice of certain before uncertain, upon due examination; to like 
purpose answer'd all the rest of his Sages, none openly dissenting from 
what was likely to the King's Creed: wheras the Preaching of Paulinus 
could work no such effect upon them, toiling till that time without 
success.  Wherupon Edwin renouncing Heathenism, became Christian: and 
the Pagan Priest offering himself freely to demolish the Altars of his 
former Gods, made some amends for his teaching to adore them.  With 
Edwin, his two Sons Osfrid and Eanfrid, born to him by Quenburga,37. 
Daughter, as saith Beda, of Kearle King of Mercia, in the time of his 
Banishment, and with them most of the People, both Nobles and Commons, 
easily converted, were baptiz'd; he with his whole Family at York, in a 
Church hastily built up of Wood, the multitude most part in Rivers.  
Northumberland thus christen'd, Paulinus crossing Humber, converted also 
the Province of Lindsey, and Blecca the Governour of Lincoln, with his 
Houshold and most of that City; wherin he built a Church of Stone, 
curiously wrought, but of small continuance; for the Roof in Beda's 
time, uncertain whether by Neglect or Enemies, was down; the Walls only 
standing.  Mean while in Mercia, Kearle a Kinsman of Wibba, saith 
Huntingdon, not a Son, having long withheld the Kingdom from Penda 
Wibba's Son, left it now at length to the fiftieth Year of his Age: with 
whom Kinegils and Cuichelm, the West-Saxon Kings, two years after,38. 
having by that time it seems recover'd Strength, since the Inroad made 
upon them by Edwin,39. fought at Cirencester, then made Truce.  But 
Edwin seeking every way to propagate the Faith, which with so much 
deliberation he had receiv'd, persuaded Eorpwald the Son of Redwald, 
King of East-Angles, to embrace the same belief;40. willingly or in awe, 
is not known, retaining under Edwin the name only of a King.41.  But 
Eorpwald not long surviv'd his Conversion, slain in fight by Ricbert a 
Pagan:42. wherby the People having lightly follow'd the Religion of 
their King, as lightly fell back to their old Superstitions for above 
three Years after: Edwin in the mean while, to his Faith adding Virtue, 
by the due Administration of Justice wrought such Peace over all his 
Territories, that from Sea to Sea, Man or Woman might have travelled in 
safety.  His care also was of Fountains by the way side, to make them 
fittest for the use of Travellers.  And not unmindful of regal State, 
whether in War or in Peace, he had a Royal Banner carried before him.  
But having reign'd with much Honour seventeen years, he was at length by 
Kedwallay or Cadwallon, King of the Britains, who with aid of the 
Mercian Penda had rebell'd against him, slain in a Battel with his Son 
Osfrid, at a place call'd Hethfield, and his whole Army overthrown or 
disperst in the Year 633,43. and the 47th of his Age, in the eye of Man 
worthy a more peaceful end.  His Head brought to York was there buried 
in the Church by him begun.  Sad was this overthrow, both to Church and 
State of the Northumbrians: for Penda being a Heathen, and the British 
King, though in name a Christian, but in deeds more bloody then the 
Pagan, nothing was omitted of barbarous Cruelty in the Slaughter of Sex 
or Age; Kedwalla threatning to root out the whole Nation, though then 
newly Christian.  For the Britains, and as Beda saith, even to his days, 
accounted Saxon Christianity no better then Paganism, and with them held 
as little Communion.  From these Calamitites no refuge being left but 
flight, Paulinus taking with him Ethilburga the Queen and her Children, 
aided by Bassus, one of Edwin's Captains, made escape by Sea to Eadbald 
King of Kent: who receiving his Sister with all kindness, made Paulinus 
Bishop of Rochester, where he ended his days.  After Edwin, the Kingdom 
of Northumberland became divided as before, each rightful Heir seizing 
his part; in Deira Osric, the Son of Elfric, Edwin's Uncle, by 
profession a Christian, and baptiz'd by Paulinus: in Bernicia, Eanfrid 
the Son of Ethelfrid; who all the time of Edwin, with his Brother 
Oswald, and many of the young Nobility, liv'd in Scotland exil'd, and 
had bin there taught and baptiz'd.  No sooner had they gotten each a 
Kingdom, but both turn'd recreant, sliding back into their old Religion; 
and both were the same year slain; Osric by a sudden eruption of 
Kedwalla, whom he in a strong Town had unadvisedly besieg'd; Eanfrid 
seeking Peace, and inconsiderately with a few surrendering himself.  
Kedwalla now rang'd at will through both those Provinces, using cruelly 
his Conquest; when Oswald the Brother of Eanfrid with a small but 
Christian Army unexpectedly coming on,44. defected and destroyed both 
him and his huge Forces, which he boasted to be invincible, by a little 
River running into Tine, near the ancient Roman Wall then call'd 
Denisburn, the place afterwards Heaven-field, from the Cross reported 
miraculous for Cures, which Oswald there erected before the Battel, in 
token of his Faith against the great number of his Enemies.  Obtaining 
the Kingdom, he took care to instruct again the People in Christianity.  
Sending therfore to the Scotish Elders, Beda so terms them, among whom 
he had receiv'd Baptism, requested of them some faithful Teacher, who 
might again settle Religion in his Realm, which the late Troubles had 
much impair'd; they as readily hearkening to his Request, send Aidan, a 
Scotch Monk and Bishop, but of singular Zeal and Meekness, with others 
to assist him, whom at their own desire he seated in Lindisfarne, as the 
Episcopal Seat, now Holy Island: and being the Son of Ethelfrid, by the 
Sister of Edwin, as right Heir, others failing, easily reduc'd both 
Kingdom of Northumberland as before into one; nor of Edwin's Dominion 
lost any part, but enlarg'd it rather; over all the four British 
Nations, Angles, Britains, Picts and Scots, exercising regal Authority.  
Of his Devotion, Humility, and Alms-deeds, much is spoken; that he 
disdain'd not to be the Interpreter of Aidan, preaching in Scotch or 
English, to his Nobles and Houshold Servants; and had the Poor 
continually served at his Gate, after the promiscuous manner of those 
times: his meaning might be upright, but the manner more ancient of 
private or of Church-Contribution, is doubtless more Evangelical.45.  
About this time the West-Saxons, antiently call'd Gevissi, by the 
preaching of Berinus,46. a Bishop, whom Pope Honorius had sent, were 
converted to the Faith with Kinegils their King: him Oswald receiv'd out 
of the Font, and his Daughter in Marriage.47.  The next Year Cuichelm 
was baptiz'd in Dorchester, but liv'd not to the year's end.  The East-
Angles also this year were reclaim'd to the Faith of Christ, which for 
some years past they had thrown off.  But Sigbert the Brother of 
Eorpwald now succeeded in that Kingdom, prais'd for a most Christian and 
Learned Man: who while his Brother yet reign'd, living in France an 
Exile, for some displeasure conceiv'd against him by Redwald his Father, 
learn'd there the Christian Faith; and reigning soon after, in the same 
instructed his People, by the preaching of Felix a Burgundian Bishop.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">In the year 640 Eadbald deceasing,48. left to Ercombert his Son by 
Emma the French King's Daughter, the Kingdom of Kent; recorded the first 
of English Kings, who commanded through his limits the destroying of 
Idols; laudably, if all Idols without exception; and the first to have 
establish'd Lent among us,  under strict Penalty, not worth remembring, 
but only to inform us, that no Lent was observ'd here till his time by 
compulsion:49. especially being noted by some to have fraudulently 
usurp'd upon his elder Brother Ermenred, whose right was precedent to 
the Crown.  Oswald having reign'd eight years, worthy also as might seem 
of longer Life,50. fell into the same fate with Edwin, and from the same 
hand, in a great Battel overcome and slain by Penda,51. at a place 
call'd Maserfield, now Oswestre in Shropshire, miraculous, as saith 
Beda, after his Death.52.  His Brother Oswi succeeded him; reigning, 
though in much trouble, 28 Years;53. oppos'd either by Penda, or his own 
Son Alfred, or his Brother's Son Ethilwald.  Next Year Kinegils the 
West-Saxon dying, left his Son Kenwalk in his stead, though as yet 
unconverted.54.  About this time Sigebert King of East-Angles having 
learnt in France, ere his coming to reign, the manner of their Schools, 
with the Assistance of some Teachers out of Kent, instituted a School 
here after the same Discipline, thought to be the University of 
Cambridge, then first founded; and at length weary of his Kingly Office, 
betook him to a Monastical Life; commending the care of Government to 
his Kinsman Egric, who had sustain'd with him part of that Burden 
before.  It happen'd some Years after, that Penda made war on the East-
Angles: they expecting a sharp Encounter, besought Sigebert, whom they 
esteem'd an expert Leader, with his Presence to confirm the Soldiery; 
and his refusing, carried by force out of the Monastery into the Camp; 
where acting the Monk rather then the Captain, with a single Wand in his 
hand, he was slain with Egric, and his whole Army put to flight.  Anna 
of the Royal Stock, as next in right, succeeded; and hath the Praise of 
a virtuous and most Christian Prince.55.  But Kenwalk the West-Saxon 
having marry'd the Sister of Penda, and divorc'd her,56. was by him with 
more appearance of a just cause vanquish'd in Fight, and depriv'd of his 
Crown: whence retiring to Anna King of East-Angles, after three Years 
abode in his Court, he there became Christian, and afterwards regain'd 
his Kingdom.57.  Oswi in the former Years of his Reign had sharer with 
him, Oswin Nephew of Edwin, who rul'd in Deira seven Years, commended 
much for his Zeal in Religion, and for Comeliness of Person, with other 
princely Qualities, belov'd of all.  Notwithstanding which, Dissensions 
growing between them, it came to Arms.  Oswin seeing himself much 
exceeded in numbers, thought it more Prudence, dismissing his Army, to 
reserve himself for some better occasion.  But committing his Person 
with one faithful Attendant to the Loyalty of Hunwald an Earl, his 
imagin'd Friend, he was by him treacherously discover'd, and by Command 
of Oswi slain.58.  After whom within twelve days, and for grief of him 
whose Death he foretold, died Bishop Aidan, famous for his Charity, 
Meekness, and Labour in the Gospel.59.  The Fact of Oswi was detestable 
to all; which therfore to expiate, a Monastery was built in the place 
where it was done, and Prayers there daily offer'd up for the Souls of 
both Kings, the Slain and the Slayer.  Kenwalk by this time re-install'd 
in his Kingdom, kept it long, but with various Fortune;60. for Beda 
relates him oft-times afflicted by his Enemies, with great Losses: and 
in 652, by the Annals,61. fought a Battel (Civil War Ethelwerd calls it) 
at Bradanford by the River Afene; against whom, and for what cause, or 
who had the Victory, they write not.  Camden names the place Bradford in 
Wiltshire, by the River Avon, and Cuthred his near Kinsman, against whom 
he fought, but cites no Authority; certain it is, that Kenwalk four 
Years before had given large Possessions to his Nephew Cuthred, the most 
unlikely therfore now to have rebell'd.
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8"> The next Year Peada,62. whom his Father Penda, though a Heathen, 
had for his Vertues made Prince of Middle-Angles, belonging to the 
Mercians, was with that People converted to the Faith.  For coming to 
Oswi with request to have in marriage Alfleda his Daughter, he was 
deny'd her, but on condition, that he with all his People should receive 
Christianity.  Hearing therfore not unwillingly what was preach'd to him 
of Resurrection and Eternal Life, much persuaded also by Alfrid the 
King's Son, who had his Sister Kyniburg to Wife, he easily assented, for 
the Truth's sake only as he profess'd, whether he obtain'd the Virgin or 
no, and was baptiz'd with all his Followers.  Returning, he took with 
him four Presbyters to teach the People of his Province; who by their 
daily preaching won many.  Neither did Penda, though himself no Beliver, 
prohibit any in his Kingdom to hear or believe the Gospel, but rather 
hated and despised those, who professing to believe, attested not their 
Faith by good Works; condemning them for miserable and justly to be 
despis'd, who obey not that God in whom they choose to believe.  How 
well might Penda, this Heathen, rise up in judgment against many 
pretended Christians, both of his own and these days! yet being a Man 
bred up to War63. (as no less were others then reigning, and oft-times 
one against another, though both Christians)64. he warr'd on Anna King 
of the East-Angles, perhaps without cause, for Anna was esteem'd a just 
Man, and at length slew him.  About this time the East-Saxons, who, as 
above hath been said, had expell'd their Bishop Mellitus, and renounc'd 
their Faith, were by the means of Oswi thus reconverted.  Sigebert, 
surnam'd the small, being the Son of Seward, without other memory of his 
Reign, left his Son King of that Province, after him Sigebert the 
Second; who coming often to visit Oswi his great Friend, was by him at 
seveal times fervently dissuaded from Idolatry, and convinc'd at length 
to forsake it, was there baptiz'd; on his return home taking with him 
Kedda a laborious Preacher, afterwards made Bishop; by whose teaching, 
with some help of others, the People were again recover'd from 
Misbelief.  But Sigebert some Years after, though standing fast in 
Religion, was by the Conspiracy of two Brethren, in place near about 
him, wickedly murder'd; who being ask'd what mov'd them to a Deed so 
heinous, gave no other then this barbarous Answer; that they were angry 
with him for being so gentle to his Enemies, as to forgive them their 
Injuries whenever they besought him.  Yet his Death seems to have 
happen'd not without some cause by him given of Divine Displeasure.  For 
one of those Earls who slew him living in unlawful Wedloc, and thefore 
excommunicated so severely by the Bishop, that no Man might presume to 
enter into his House, much less to sit at Meat with him, the King not 
regarding this Church-Censure, went to feast with him at his Invitation.  
Whom the Bishop meeting in his Return, though penitent for what he had 
done, and faln at his feet, touch'd with the Rod in his hand, and 
angrily thus foretold: Because thou hast neglected to abstain from the 
House of that Excommunicate, in that House thou shalt die; and so it 
fell out, perhaps from that Prediction, God bearing witness to his 
Minister in the Power of Church-Discipline, spiritually executed, not 
juridically on the Contemner therof.  This year 655 prov'd fortunate to 
Oswi, and fatal to Penda;65. for Oswi by the continual Inroads of Penda 
having long endur'd much Devastation, to the endangering once by Assault 
and Fire Bebbanburg, his strongest City, now Bamborrow- Castle66. , 
unable to resist him, with many rich Presents offe'r to buy his Peace, 
which not accepted by the Pagan,67. who intended nothing but Destruction 
to that King, though more then once in affinity with him, turning Gifts 
into Vows, he implores Divine Assistance, devoting, if he were deliver'd 
from his Enemy, a Child of one year old, his Daughter, to be a Nun, and 
12 portions of Land wheron to build Monasteries.  His Vows, as may be 
thought, found better success then his profer'd Gifts; for herupon with 
his Son Alfrid, gathering a small Power, he encounter'd and discomfited 
the Mercians, 30 times exceeding his in number, and led on by expert 
Captains, at a place call'd Loydes, now Leeds in Yorkshire.68.  Besides 
this Ethelwald, the Son of Oswald, who rul'd in Deira, took part with 
the Mercians; but in the Fight withdrew his Forces, and in a safe place 
expected the event: with which unseasonable Retreat the Mercians, 
perhaps terrify'd and misdoubting more Danger, fled; their Commanders, 
with Penda himself, most being slain, among whom Edilhere the Brother of 
Anna, who rul'd after him the East-Angles, and was the Author of this 
War; many more flying were drown'd in the River, which Beda calls 
Winwed, then swoln above its Banks.69.  The Death of Penda, who had been 
the death of so many good Kings, made general rejoicing, as the Song 
witness'd.  At the River Winwed, Anna was aveng'd.  To Edelhere 
succeeded Ethelwald his Brother, in the East-Angles; to Sigebert, in the 
East-Saxons Suidhelm the Son of Sexbald, saith Bede, the Brother of 
Sigebert, saith Malmsbury;70. he was baptiz'd by Kedda, then residing in 
the East-Angles, and by Ethelwald the King receiv'd out of the Font.  
But Oswi in the strength of his late Victory, within three years 
after71. subdu'd all Mercia, and of the Pictish Nation greatest part,72. 
at which time he gave to Peada his Son-in-law the Kingdom of South-
Mercia, divided from the Northern by Trent.  But Peada the Spring 
following,73. as was said, by the Treason of his Wife the Daughter of 
Oswi, married by him for a special Christian,74. on the Feast of Easter, 
not protected by the holy time, was slain.  The Mercian Nobles, Immin, 
Eaba, and Eadbert, throwing off the Government of Oswi, set up Wulfer 
the other Son of Penda to be their King, whom till then they had kept 
his, and with him adher'd to the Christian Faith.  Kenwalk the West-
Saxon, now settled at home, and desirous to enlarge his Dominion, 
prepares against the Britains, joins battel with them at Pen in 
Somersetshire, and overcoming, pursues them to Pedridan.  Another Fight 
he had with them before, at a place call'd Witgeornesburg, barely 
mention'd by the Monk of Malmsbury.  Nor was it long75. ere he fell at 
variance with Wulfer the Son of Penda, his old Enemy, scarce yet warm in 
his Throne, 76. fought with him at Possentesburg, on the Easter Holy-
days, and as Ethelwerd saith, took him prisoner; but the Saxon Annals, 
quite otherwise, that Wulfer winning the Field, wasted the West-Saxon 
Country as far as Eskesdun; nor staying there, took and wasted the Isle 
of Wight, but causing the Inhabitants to be baptiz'd, till then 
Unbvelievers, gave the Island to Ethelwald King of South Saxons, whom he 
had received out of the Font.  The Year 664 a Synod of Scotish and 
English Bishops,77. in the presence of Oswi and Alfred his Son,78. was 
held at a Monastery in those parts, to debate on what day Easter should 
be kept; a Controversy which long before had disturb'd the Greek and 
Latin Churches: wherin the Scots not agreeing with the way of Rome; nor 
yielding to the Disputants on that side, to whom the King most inclin'd, 
such as were Bishops here, resign'd and return'd home with their 
Disciples.  Another clerical Question was there also much controverted, 
not so superstitious in my opinion as ridiculous, about the right 
shaving of Crowns.  The same year was seen an Eclipse of the Sun in May, 
followed by a sore Pestilence beginning in the South, but spreading to 
the North, and over all Ireland, with great Mortality.79.  In which time 
the East-Saxons, after Swithelm's Decease, being govern'd by Siger the 
Son of Sigebert the small, and Sebbi of Seward, though both subject to 
the Mercians; Siger and his People unsteady of Faith supposing that this 
Plague was come upon them for renouncing their old Religion, fell off 
the second time to Infidelity.  Which the Mercian King Wulfer 
understanding, sent Jarumannus a faithful Bishop, who with other his 
Fellow-labourers, by sound Doctrine and gentle dealing, soon recured 
them of their second Relapse.  In Kent, Ercombert expiring, was 
succeeded by his Son Echert.80.  In whose fourth Year, by means of 
Theodore, a learned Greekish Monk of Tarsus,81. whom Pope Vitalian had 
ordain'd Archbishop of Canterbury, the Greek and Latin Tongue, with 
other liberal Arts, Arithmetic, Music, Astronomy, and the like began 
first to flourish among the Saxons; as did also the whole Land, under 
potent and religious Kings, more then ever before, as Bede affirms, till 
his own days.  Two Years after in Northumberland died Oswi,82. much 
addicted to Romish Rites, and resolv'd, had his Disease releas'd him, to 
have ended his days at Rome.83.  Ecfrid the eldest of his Sons begot in 
wedloc, succeeded him.  After other three Years, Ecbert in Kent  
deceasing,84. left nothing memorable behind him, but the general 
suspicion to have slain or conniv'd at the slaughter of his Uncle's two 
Sons, Elbert and Egelbright.85.  In recompence wherof he gave to the 
Mother of them, part of Tanet, wherin to build an Abbey; the Kingdom 
fell to his Brother Lothair.86.  And much about this time, by best 
account it should be, however plac'd in Beda,87. that Ecfrid of 
Northumberland having War with the Mercian Wulfer, won from him Lindsey, 
and the Country therabout.  Sebbi having reign'd over the East-Saxons 
thirty years, not long before his death, though long before desiring, 
took on him the Habit of a Monk; and drew his Wife at length, though 
unwilling, to the same Devotion.  Kenwalk also dying,88. left the 
Government to Sexburga his Wife, who out-liv'd him in it but one Year, 
driven out, saith Mat. Westm. by the Nobles disdaining Female 
Government.  After whom several petty Kings,89. as Beda calls them, for 
ten years space divided the West-Saxons; others name two, Escwin the 
Nephew of Kinegils, and Kentwin the Son, not petty by their Deeds:90. 
for Escwin fought a Battel with Wulfer, at Bedanhafde, 91. and about a 
year after both deceas'd;92. but Wulfer not without a stain left behind 
him, of selling the Bishoprick of London to Wini the first Simonist we 
read of in this Story; Kenwalk had before expell'd him from his Chair at 
Winchester.  Ethelred the Brother of Wulfer obtaining next the Kingdom 
of Mercia, not only recover'd Lindsey, and what besides in those parts 
Wulfer had lost to Ecfrid some years before, but found himself strong 
enough to extend his Arms another way, as far as Kent, wasting that 
Country without respect to Church or Monastery, much also endamaging the 
City of Rochester, notwithstanding what Resistance Lothair could make 
against him.93.  In August 678 was seen a Morning Comet for three Months 
following,94. in manner of a firy Pillar.  And the South-Saxons, about 
this time were converted to the Christian Faith, upon this occasion.  
Wilfrid Bishop of the Northumbrians entring into Contention with Ecfrid 
the King, was by him depriv'd of his Bishoprick, and long wandring up 
and down as far as Rome, return'd at length into England;95. but not 
daring to approach the North, whence he was banish'd, bethought him 
where he might to best purpose elsewhere exercise his Ministry.  The 
South of all other Saxons remain'd yet Heathen; but Edilwalk their King 
not long before had been baptiz'd inMercia, persuaded by Wulfer, and by 
him, as hath been said, receiv'd out of the Font.96.  For which 
relation's sake he had the Isle of Wight, and a Province of the Meannari 
adjoining given him on the Continent about Meanesborow in Hantshire, 
which Wulfer had a little before gotten from Kenwalk.97.  Thither 
Wilfrid takes his Journey, and with the help of other spiritual 
Labourers about him, in short time planted there the Gospel.  It had not 
rain'd, as is said, of three years before in that Country, whence many 
of the People daily perish'd by Famine; till on the first day of their 
public Baptism, soft and plentiful Showers descending, restor'd all 
abundance to the Summer following.  Two Years after this Kentwin the 
other West-Saxon King above-nam'd,98. chac'd the Welch-Britains, as is 
chronicled without Circumstance, to the very Sea-shore.99.  But in the 
Year, by Beda's reckoning, 683, Kedvalla a West-Saxon of the Royal 
Line,100. (whom the Welch will have to be Cadwallader, last King of the 
Britains )101. thrown out by Faction, return'd from Banishment, and 
invaded both Kentwin, if then living, or whoever else had divided the 
Succession of Kenwalk, slaying in fight Edelwalk the South-Saxon, who 
oppos'd him in their Aid;102. but soon after was repuls'd by two of his 
Captains, Bertune and Andune, who for a while held the Province in their 
power.103.  But Kedwalla gathering new Force,104. with the Slaughter of 
Bertune, and also of Edric the Successor of Edlewalk, won the 
Kingdom;105. but reduc'd the People to heavy Thraldom.  Then addressing 
to conquer the Isle of Wight, till that time Pagan, saith Beda, (others 
otherwise, as above hath been related) made a Vow, though himself yet 
unbaptiz'd, to devote the fourth part of that Island, and the Spoils 
therof to holy Uses.  Conquest obtain'd, paying his Vow as then was the 
Belief, he gave his fourth to Bishop Wilfrid, by chance there present; 
and he to Bertwin a Priest, his Sister's Son, with commission to baptize 
all the vanquish'd, who meant to save their Lives.  But the two young 
Sons of Arwald, King of that Island, met with much more Hostility; for 
they at the Enemy's approach flying out of the Isle, and betray'd where 
they were hid not far from thence, were led to Kedwalla, who lay then 
under cure of some Wounds receiv'd, and by his appointment, after 
Instruction and Baptism first given them, harshly put to death, which 
the Youths are said above their Age to have christianly suffer'd.  In 
Kent Lothair died this Year of his Wounds receiv'd in fight against the 
South-Saxons, led on by Edric, who descending from Ermenrid, it seems 
challeng'd the Crown, and wore it, though not commendably, one year and 
a half:106. but coming to a violent death, left the Land expos'd a Prey 
either to home-bred Usurpers, or neighbouring Invaders.107.  Among whom 
Kedwalla taking advantage from their civil Distempers, and marching 
easily through the South-Saxons, whom he had subdu'd, sorely harrass'd 
the Country, untouch'd of a long time by any hostile Incursion.  But the 
Kentish Men, all Parties uniting against a common Enemy, with joint 
Power so oppos'd him, that he was constrain'd to retire back; his 
Brother Mollo in the flight with 12 Men in his company, seeking shelter 
in a House, was beset, and therin burnt by the Pursuers:108. Kedwalla 
much troubled at so great a Loss,109. recalling and soon rallying his 
disorder'd Forces, return'd fiercely upon the chasing Enemy;110. nor 
could he be got out of the Province, till both by Fire and Sword he had 
avang'd the Death of his Brother.  At length Victred the Son of Ecbert, 
attaining the Kingdom,111. both settled at home all things in Peace, and 
secur'd his Borders from all outward Hostility.  While thus Kedwalla 
disquieted both West and East,112. after his winning the Crown, Ecfrid 
the Northumbrian, and Ethelred the Mercian, fought a sore Battel by the 
River Trent; wherin Elfwin Brother to Ecfrid, a Youth of 18 years, much 
belov'd, was slain; and the accident likely to occasion much more 
shedding of Blood, Peace was happily made up by the grave Exhortation of 
Archbishop Theodore, a pecuniary Fine only paid to Ecfrid, as some 
satisfaction for the loss of his Brother's Life.  Another Adversity 
befel Ecfrid in his Family, by means of Ethildrith his Wife, King Anna's 
Daughter, who having taken him for her Husband, and professing to love 
him above all other men, persisted twelve years in the obstinate refusal 
of his Bed, therby thinking to live the purer Life.  So perversly then 
was Chastity instructed against the Apostle's rule.  At length obtaining 
of him with much importunity her departure, she veil'd her self a Nun, 
then made Abbess of Ely, died 7 years after the Pestilence; and might 
with better warrant have kept faithfully her undertaken Wedlock, though 
now canoniz'd St. Audrey of Ely.  In the mean while Ecfrid had sent 
Bertus with a power to subdue Ireland, a harmless Nation, saith Beda, 
and ever friendly to the English; in both which they seem to have left a 
Posterity much unlike them at this day; miserably wasted, without regard 
had to places hallow'd or profane; they betook themselves partly to 
their Weapons. partly to implore divine Aid; and, as was thought, 
obtain'd it in their full avengement upon Ecfrid.  For he the next year, 
against the mind and persuasion of his sagest Friends, and especially of 
Cudbert a famous Bishop of that Age, marching unadvisedly against the 
Picts, who long before had been subject to Northumberland, was by them 
feigning flight, drawn unawares into narrow streights, overtopt with 
Hills, and cut off with most of his Army.  From which time, saith Bede, 
military Valour began among the Saxons to decay, not only the Picts till 
then peaceable, but some part of the Britains also recoverd by Arms 
their Liberty for many years after.  Yet Alfrid elder, but base Brother 
to Ecfrid, a man said to be learn'd in the Scriptures, recall'd from 
Ireland, to which place in his Brother's Reign he had retir'd, and now 
succeeding, upheld with much honour, though in narrower bounds, the 
residue of his Kingdom.  Kedwalla having now with great disturbance of 
his Neighbours reign'd over the West-Saxons two years, besides what time 
he spent in gaining it, wearied perhaps with his own turbulence, went to 
Rome, desirous there to receive Baptism, which till then his worldly 
Affairs had defer'd; and accordingly, on Easter Day, 689. he was 
baptized by Sergius the Pope, and his name chang'd to Peter.  All which 
notwithstanding, surpris'd with a Disease, he outliv'd not the Ceremony 
so far sought, much above the space of five Weeks, in the thirtieth year 
of his Age, and in the Church of St. Peter was there buried, with a 
large Epitaph on his Tomb.  Him succeeded Ina of the Royal Family, and 
from the time of his coming in, for many years oppress'd the Land with 
like Grievances, as Kedwalla had done before him, insomuch that in those 
times there was no Bishop among them.  His first Expedition was into 
Kent, to demand satisfaction for the burning of Mollo: Victred loth to 
hazard all for the rash act of a few, deliver'd up 30 of those that 
could be found accessory, or as others say, pacify'd Ina with a great 
sum of Money.113.  Mean while, at the incitement of Ecbert, a devout 
Monk, Wilbrod a Priest eminent for Learning, past over Sea, having 12 
others in company, with intent to preach the Gospel in Germany.114.  And 
coming to Pepin Chief Regent of the Franks, who a little before had 
conquer'd the hither Frisia, by his Countenance and Protection, promise 
also of many Benefits to them who should believe, they found the work of 
Conversion much the easier, and Wilbrod the first Bishoprick in that 
Nation.  But two Priests, each of them Hewald by name, and for 
distinction surnam'd from the colour of their Hair, the black and the 
white, by his example, piously affected to the Souls of their Countrymen 
the old Saxons, at their coming thither to convert them met with much 
worse entertainment.  For in the House of a Farmer who had promis'd to 
convey them, as they desir'd, to the Governour of that Country, 
discover'd by their daily Ceremonies to be Christian Priests, and the 
cause of their coming suspected, they were by him and his Heathen 
Neighbours cruelly butcher'd; yet not unaveng'd, for the Governor 
enrag'd at such violence offer'd to his Strangers, sending armed Men 
slew all those Inhabitants, and burnt their Village.  After three years 
in Mercia,115. Ostrid the Queen, Wife to Ethelred, was kill'd by her own 
Nobles, as Beda's Epitome records; Florence calls them Southimbrians, 
negligently omitting the cause of so strange a fact.116.  And the year 
following, Berthred a Northumbrian General was slain by the Picts.  
Ethelred seven years after the violent Death of his Queen,117. put on 
the Monk, and resign'd his Kingdom to Kenred the Son of Wulfer his 
Brother.118.  The next year, Alfrid in Northumberland died, leaving 
Osred a Child of 8 years to succeed him.119.  Four years after which, 
Kenred having a while with praise govern'd the Mercian Kingdom, went to 
Rome in the time of Pope Constantine, and shorn a Monk spent there the 
residue of his Days.  Kelred succeeded him, the Son of Ethelred, who had 
reign'd the next before.  With Kenred went Offa the Son of Siger, King 
of the East-Saxons, and betook him to the same Habit, leaving his Wife 
and Native Country; a comely Person in the prime of his Youth, much 
desir'd of the People; and such his Virtue by report, as might have 
otherise been worthy to have reign'd.  Ina the West-Saxon one year after 
fought a Battel,120. at first doubtful,121. at last successful, against 
Gerent King of Wales.122.  The next year Bertfrid,123. another 
Nothumbrian Captain, fought with the Picts,124. and slaughter'd them, 
saith Huntingdon, to the full avengement of Ecfrid's Death.  The fourth 
year after Ina125. had another doubtful and cruel Battel at Woodnesburgh 
in Wiltshire,126. with Kelred the Mercian,127. who died the year 
following a lamentable Death:128. for as he sat one day feasting with 
his Nobles, suddenly possess'd with an evil Spirit, he expir'd in 
despair, as Boniface Archbishop of Ments, an English-man, who taxes him 
for a defiler of Nuns, writes by way of Caution to Ethelbald his next of 
kin, who succeeded him.  Osred also a young Northumbrian King, slain by 
his Kindred in the 11th of his Reign for his vicious Life and Incest 
committed with Nuns, was by Kenred succeeded and aveng'd; he reigning 
two years, left Osric in his room.  In whose 7th year,129. if Beda 
calculate right, Victred King of Kent deceas'd, having reign'd 34 years, 
and some part of them with Suebbard, as Beda testifies.130.  He left 
behind him three Sons, Ethelbert, Eadbert, and Alric his Heirs.131.  
Three years after which132. , appear'd two Comets about the Sun, 
terrible to behold, the one before him in the Morning, the other after 
him in the Evening, for the space of two Weeks in January, bending their 
blaze toward the North; at which time the Saracens furiously invaded 
France, but were expell'd soon after with great overthrow.  The same 
year in Northumberland, Osric dying or slain, adopted Kelwulf the 
Brother of Kenred his Successor, to whom Beda dedicates his story;133. 
but writes this only of him, that the beginning, and the process of his 
Reign met with many adverse Commotions, wherof the event was then 
doubtfully expected.  Mean while Ina seven years before, having slain 
Kenwulf, to whom Florent gives the addition of Clito, given usually to 
none but of the Blood Royal, and the fourth year after overthrown and 
slain Albright another Clito, driven from Taunton to the South-Saxons 
for aid, vanquish'd also the East-Angles in more then one Battle, as 
Malmsbury writes, but not the year; whether to expiate so much Blood, or 
infected with the contagious humour of those times, Malmsbury saith, at 
the persuasion of Ethelburga his Wife, went to Rome, and there ended his 
days; yet this praise left behind him, to have made good Laws, the first 
of Saxon that remain extant to this day, and to his Kinsman Edelard 
bequeath'd the Crown, no less then the whole Monarchy of England and 
Wales.  For Ina, if we believe a digression in the Laws of Edward 
Confessor, was the first King crown'd of English and British, since the 
Saxons entrance; of the British by means of his second Wife, some way 
related to Cadwallader last King of Wales, which I had not noted, being 
unlikely, but for the place where I found it.  After Ina, by a surer 
Author,134. Ethelbald King of Mercia commanded all the Provinces on this 
side Humber, with their Kings:135. the Picts were in league with the 
English, the Scots peaceable within their bounds, and of the Britains 
part were in their own Government, part subject to the English.  In 
which peaceful state of the Land, many in Northumberland, both Nobles 
and Commons, laying aside the exercise of Arms, betook them to the 
Cloister: and not content so to do at home, many in the days of Ina, 
Clerks and Laics, Men and Women, hasting to Rome in Herds, thought 
themselves no where sure of Eternal Life, till they were cloister'd 
there.  Thus representing the state of things in this Island, Beda 
surceas'd to write.  Out of whom chiefly has been gather'd since the 
Saxons arrival, such as hath been deliver'd, a scatter'd story pickt out 
here and there, with some trouble and tedious work, from among his many 
Legends of Visions and Miracles; toward the latter end so bare of civil 
matters, as what can be thence collected may seem a Calendar rather then 
a History, taken up for the most part with succession of Kings, and 
computation of years, yet those hard to be reconcil'd with the Saxon 
Annals.  Their actions we read of, were most commonly Wars, but for what 
cause waged, or by what Councils carried on, no care was had to let us 
know; wherby their Strength and Violence we understand, of their Wisdom, 
Reason, or Justice, little or nothing, the rest Superstition and 
monastical Affectation; Kings one after another, leaving their Kingly 
Charge, to run their heads fondly into a Monk's Cowle: which leaves us 
uncertain whether Beda was wanting to his matter, or his matter to him.  
Yet from hence to the Danish Invasion it will be worse with us, 
destitute of Beda.  Left only to obscure and blockish Chronicles; whom 
Malmsbury, and Huntingdon (for neither they nor we had better Authors of 
those times) ambitious to adorn the History, make no scruple, oft-times 
I doubt, to interline with conjectures and surmises of their own; them 
rather then imitate, I shall choose to represent the truth naked, though 
as lean as a plain Journal.  Yet William of Malmsbury must be 
acknowledg'd, both for stile and judgment, to be by far the best Writer 
of them all: but what labour is to be endur'd turning over Volumes of 
rubbish in the rest, Florence of Worcester, Huntingdon, Simeon of 
Durham, Hoveden, Matthew of Westminster, and many others of obscurer 
note, with all their Monachisms, is a penance to think.  Yet these are 
our only Registers, transcribers one after another for the most part, 
and sometimes worthy enough for the things they register.  This travail 
rather then not know at once what may be known of our ancient story, 
sifted from fables and impertinences, I voluntarily undergo; and to save 
others, if they please, the like unpleasing labour; except those who 
take pleasure to be all their Life-time raking in the Foundations of old 
Abbeys and Cathedrals.  But to my Task now as it befals.  In the year 
733, on the 18th Kalends of September,136. was an Eclipse of the Sun 
about the third hour of day,137. obscuring almost his whole Orb as with 
a black Shield.138.  Ethelbald of Mercia besieg'd and took the Castle or 
Town of Somerton: and two years after Beda our Historian died,139. some 
say the year before.  Kelwulf in Northumberland three years after became 
a Monk in Lindisfarne,140. yet none of the severest,141. for he brought 
those Monks from Milk and Water, to Wine and Ale; in which Doctrine no 
doubt but they were soon docil, andwell might, for Kelwulf brought with 
him good Provision, great Treasure and Revenues of Land, recited by 
Simeon, yet all under pretence of following (I use the Author's words) 
poor Christ, by voluntary Poverty; no marvel then if such applause were 
given by Monkish Writers to Kings turning Monks, and much cunning 
perhaps us'd to allure them.  To Eadbert his Uncle's Son, he left the 
Kingdom, whose Brother Ecbert, Archbishop of York, built a Library 
there.142.  But two years after, while Eadbert was busied in War against 
the Picts, Ethelbald the Mercian, by foul fraud, assaulted part of 
Northumberland in his absence, as the supplement to Beda's Epitome 
records.  In the West-Saxons, Edelard who succeeded Ina, having been 
much molested in the beginning of his Reign, with the Rebellion of 
Oswald his Kinsman, who contended with him for the right of Succession, 
overcoming at last those troubles, died in Peace 741,143. leaving 
Cuthred one of the same Lineage to succeed him;144. who at first had 
much War with Ethelbald the Mercian, and various success,145. but 
joining with him in league two years after, made war on the Welch;146. 
Huntingdon doubts not to give them a great Victory.147.  And Simeon 
reports another Battel fought between Britains and Picts the year 
ensuing. 148. Now was the Kingdom of East-Saxons drawing to a 
Period,149. for Sigeard and Senfred the Sons of Sebbi having reign'd a 
while,150. and after them youg Offa,151. who soon quitted his Kingdom to 
go to Rome with Kenred, as hath been said, the Government was confer'd 
on Selred the Son of Sigebert the good, who having rul'd 38 years, came 
to a violent Death;152. how or wherfore, is not set down.  After whom 
Swithred was the last King, driven out by Ecbert the West-Saxon: but 
London, with the Countries adjacent, obey'd the Mercians till they also 
were dissolv'd.153.  Cuthred had now reign'd about nine years,154. when 
Kenric his Son, a valiant young Prince, was in a military Tumult slain 
by his own Soldiers.155.  The same year Eadbert dying in Kent, his 
Brother Edilbert reign'd in his stead.  But after two years,156. the 
other Eadbert in Northumberland whose War with the Picts hath been above 
mentioned, made now such Progress there, as to subdue Kyle, so saith the 
Auctarie of Bede, and other Countries thereabout, to his Dominion; while 
Cuthred the West-Saxon had a fight with Ethelhun, one of his Nobles, a 
stout Warrior, envy'd by him in some matter of the Commonwealth, as far 
as by the Latin of Ethelwerd can be understood157. (others interpret it 
Sedition)158. and with much ado overcoming, took Ethelhun for his Valour 
into favour, by whom faithfully serv'd in the twelfth or thirteenth of 
his Reign,159. he encounter'd in a set Battel with Ethelbald the Mercian 
at Beorford, now Burford in Oxfordshire; one year after against the 
Welch,160. which was the last but one of his Life.  Huntingdon, as his 
manner is to comment upon the annal Text, makes a terrible description 
of that Fight between Cuthred and Ethelbald, and the Prowess of 
Ethelhun, at Beorford, but so affectedly, and therfore suspicously, that 
I hold it not worth rehearsal; and both in that and the latter Conflict, 
gives Victory to Cuthred;161. after whom Sigebert,162. uncertain by what 
right, his Kinsman saith Florent,163. stept into the Throne, whom hated 
for his Cruelty and other evil doings, Kinwulf joining with most of the 
Nobility, dispossess'd of all but Hampshire, that Province he lost also 
within a year,164. together with the love of all those who till then 
remain'd his Adherents, by slaying Cambran, one of his Chief Captains, 
who for a long time had faithfully serv'd, and now dissuaded him from 
incensing the People by such Tyrannical Practices.165.  Thence flying 
for safety into Andrew's Wood, forsaken of all, he was at length slain 
by the Swineherd of Cumbran166. in revenge of his Master, and Kinwulf 
who had undoubted right to the Crown, joyfully saluted King.  The next 
year Eadbert the Northumbrian167. joining Forces with Unust King of the 
Picts, as Simeon writes,168. besieg'd and took by surrender the City of 
Alcluith, now Dunbritton in Lennox, from the Britains of Cumberland;169. 
and ten days after, the whole Army perish'd about Niwanbirig, but to 
tell us how, he forgets.170.  In Mercia, Ethelbald was slain at a place 
call'd Secandune, 171. now Seckington in Warwickshire, the year 
following,172. in a bloody Fight against Cuthred, as Huntingdon 
surmises,173. but Cuthred was dead two or three years before; others 
write him murder'd in the night by his own Guard, and the Treason, as 
some say, of Beornred, who succeeded him; but ere many Months, was 
defeated and slain by Offa.  Yet Ethelbald seems not without cause, 
after a long and prosperous Reign, to have fallen by a violent Death; 
not shaming, on the vain confidence of his many Alms, to commit 
Uncleanness with consecrated Nuns, besides Laic Adulteries, as the Arch-
bishop of Ments in a Letter taxes him and his Predecessor, and that by 
his Example most of his Peers did the like; which adulterous doings he 
foretold him were likely to produce a slothful Off-spring, good for 
nothing but to be the ruin of that Kingdom, as it fell out not long 
after.174.  The next year Osmund, according to Florence, ruling the 
South-Saxons, and Swithred the East, Eadbert in Northumberland, 
following the steps of his Predecessor, got him into a Monk's Hood; the 
more to be wonder'd, that having reign'd worthily 21 Years,175. with the 
love and high estimation of all, both at home and abroad, able still to 
govern, and much entreated by the Kings his Neighbours, not to lay down 
his Charge; with offer on that condition to yield up to him part of 
their own Dominion, he could not be mov'd from his Resolution, but 
relinquish'd his Regal Office to Oswulf his Son; who at the year's 
end,176. though without just cause, was slain by his own Servants.  And 
the year after died Ethelbert, Son of Victred, the second of that name 
in Kent.177.  After Oswulf, Ethelwald, otherwise call'd Mollo, was set 
up King;178. who in his third year had a great Battel at Eldune,179. by 
Melros, slew Oswin a great Lord, rebelling, and gain'd the Victory.  But 
the third year after,180. fell by the Treachery of Alcred, who assum'd 
his place.  The fourth year after which, Cataracta an ancient and fair 
City in Yorkshire,181. was burnt by Arnred a certain Tyrant,182. who the 
same year came to like end.  And after five years more Alcred the 
King,183. depos'd and forsaken of all his People, fled with a few, first 
to Bebba, a strong City of those parts, thence to Kinot, King of the 
Picts.184.  Ethelred the Son of Mollo, was crown'd in his stead.  Mean 
while Offa the Mercian, growing powerful, had subdu'd a neighbouring 
People by Simeon, call'd Hastings; and fought successfully this year 
with Alric the King of Kent, at a place call'd Occanford: the Annals 
also speak of wondrous Serpents then seen in Sussex.  Nor had Kinwulf 
the West-Saxon given small proof of his Valour in several Battels 
against the Welch heretofore; but this year 775, meeting with Offa,185. 
at a place call'd Besington,186. was put to the worse, and Offa won the 
Town for which they contended.  In Northumberland, Ethelred having 
caus'd three of his Nobles, Aldulf, Kinwulf and Ecca, treacherously to 
be slain187. by two other Peers,188. was himself the next year driven 
into Banishment, Elfwald the Son of Oswulf succeeding in his place, yet 
not without civil Broils; for in his second year189. Osbald and 
Athelheard, two Noblemen,190. raising Forces against him, routed Bearne 
his General, and pursuing, burnt him at a place called Seletune.  I am 
sensible how wearisome it may likely be to read of so many bare and 
reasonless Actions, so many names of Kings one after another, acting 
little more then mute Persons in a Scene: what would it be to have 
inserted the long Bead-roll of Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Abbesses, 
and their doings, neither to Religion profitable, nor to Morality, 
swelling my Authors each to a voluminous Body, by me studiously omitted; 
and left as their Propriety, who have a mind to write the Ecclesiastical 
matters of those Ages? neither do I care to wrinkle the smoothness of 
History with rugged names of places unknown, better harp'd at in Camden, 
and other Chorographers.  Six years therfore pass'd over in silence,191. 
as wholly of such Argument, bring us to relate next the unfortunate end 
of Kinwulf the West-Saxon;192. who having laudably reign'd about 31 
years,193. yet suspecting that Kincard Brother of Sigebert the former 
King, intended to usurp the Crown after his decease, or revenge his 
Brother's Expulsion, had commanded him into Banishment:194. but he 
lurking here and there on the Borders with a small Company, having had 
intelligence that Kinwulf was in the Country therabout, at Merantun, or 
Merton in Surrey,195. at the House of a Woman whom he lov'd, went by 
night and beset the place.  Kinwulf over-confident either of his Royal 
Presence, or personal Valour, issuing forth with the few about him, runs 
fiercely at Kineard, and wounds him sore; but by his Followers hem'd in, 
is kill'd among them.  The report of so great an Accident soon running 
to a place not far off, where many more Attendants awaited the King's 
return, Osric and Wivert, two Earls, hasted with a great number to the 
House, where Kineard and his Fellows yet remain'd.  He seeing himself 
surrounded, with fair words and promises of great Gifts, attempted to 
appease them; but those rejected with disdain, fights it out to the 
last, and is slain with all but one or two of his Retinue, which were 
nigh a hundred.  Kinwulf was succeeded by Birthric, being both descended 
of Kerdic the Founder of that Kingdom.  Not better was the end of 
Elfwald in Northumberland,196. two years after slain miserably by the 
Conspiracy of Siggan,197. one of his Nobles, others say of the whole 
People at Scilcester by the Roman Wall;198. yet undeservedly, as his 
Sepulchre at Hagustald, now Hexam upon Tine, and some Miracles there 
said to be done, are alleg'd to witness, and Siggan five years after 
laid violent hands on himself.199.  Osred Son of Alcred advanc'd into 
the room of Elfwald,200. and within one year driven out, left his Seat 
vacant to Ethelred Son of Mollo, who after ten years of Banishment 
(Imprisonment, saith Alcuin)201. had the Scepter put again into his 
hand.  The third year of Birthric King of West-Saxons,202. gave 
beginning from abroad to a new and fatal revolution of Calamity on this 
Land.  For three Danish Ships, the first that had been seen here of that 
Nation, arriving in the West; to visit there, as was suppos'd, Foreign 
Merchants, the King's Gatherer of Customs taking horse from Dorchester, 
found them Spies and Enemies.  For being commanded to come and give 
account of their lading at the King's Custom-house, they slew him and 
all that came with him; as an earnest of the many Slaughters, Rapines 
and Hostilities, which they return'd not long after to commit over all 
the Island.  Of this Danish first arrival,203. and on a sudden worse 
then hostile Aggression, the Danish History far otherwise relates, as if 
their landing had been at the mouth of Humber, and their spoilful march 
far into the Country; though soon repell'd by the Inhabitants, they 
hasted back as fast to their Ships: But from what Cause, what Reason of 
State, what Authority or publick Council the Invasion proceeded, makes 
not mention, and our wonder yet the more, by telling us that Sigefrid 
then King in Denmark, and long after, was a Man studious more of Peace 
and Quiet then of warlike Matters.204.  These therfore seem rather to 
have been some Wanderers at Sea, who with public Commission, or without, 
through love of Spoil, or hatred of Christianity, seeking Booties on any 
Land of Christians, came by chance or weather on this shore.205.  The 
next year206. Osred in Northumberland, who driven out by his Nobles had 
given place to Ethelred, was taken, and forcibly shaven a Monk at York.  
And the year after,207. Oelf, and Oelfwin, Son of Elfwald, formerly 
King, were drawn by fair promises from the principal Church of York,208. 
and after by command of Ethelred, cruelly put to death at 
Wonwaldremere,209. a Village by the great Pool in Lancashire, now call'd 
Winandermere.  Nor was the third year less bloody;210. for Osred, who 
not liking a shaven Crown,211. had desired Banishment and obtain'd it, 
returning from the Isle of Man with small Forces,212. at the secret but 
deceitful call of certain Nobles, who by Oath had promis'd to assist 
him, were also taken,213. and by Ethelred dealt with in the same manner: 
who the better to avouch his Cruelties, therupon married Elfled the 
Daugher of Offa; for in Offa was found as little Faith or Mercy.  He the 
same year having drawn to his Palace Ethelbrite King of East-Angles, 
with fair Invitations to marry his Daughter, caus'd him to be there 
inhospitably beheaded, and his Kingdom wrongfully seiz'd, by the wicked 
Counsel of his Wife, saith Mat. Westm. annexing therto a long unlikely 
Tale.  For which violence and bloodshed to make Atonement, with Friers 
at least, he bestows the Reliques of St. Alban in a shrine of Pearl and 
Gold.  Far worse it far'd the next year214. with the Reliques in 
Lindisfarne;215. where the Danes landing, pillag'd that Monastery; and 
of Friers kill'd some, carried away others captive, sparing neither 
Priest nor Lay: which many strange Thunders and firy Dragons, with other 
impressions in the Air seen frequently before, were judg'd to 
foresignify.  This year Alric third Son of Victred ended in Kent his 
long Reign of 34 years; with him ended the Race of Hengist: thenceforth 
whomsoever Wealth or Faction advanc'd, took on him the name and state of 
a King.  The Saxon Annals of 784, name Ealmund then reigning in Kent; 
but that consists not with the time of Alric, and I find him no where 
else mention'd.  The year following216. was remarkable for the Death of 
Offa the Mercian,217. a strenuous and subtle King; he had much 
intercourse with Charles the Great, at first Enmity, to the interdicting 
of Commerce on either side, at length much Amity and firm League, as 
appears by the Letter of Charles himself yet extant, procur'd by Alcuin 
a learned and prudent Man, though a Monk, whom the Kings of England in 
those days had sent Orator into France, to maintain good Correspondence 
between them and Charles the Great.  He granted saith Huntingdon, a 
perpetual Tribute to the Pope out of every House in his Kingdom, 218. 
for yielding perhaps to translate the Primacy of Canterbury to 
Litchfield in his own Dominion.219.  He drew a Trench of wondrous length 
between Mercia and the British Confines from Sea to Sea.  Ecferth the 
Son of Offa, a Prince of great hope, who also had been crown'd nine 
years before his Father's Decease, restoring to the Church what his 
Father had seiz'd on, yet within four Months by a Sickness ended his 
Reign; and to Kenulf next in the right of the same Progeny bequeath'd 
his Kingdom.  Mean while the Danish Pirates who still wasted 
Northumberland, venturing on shore to spoil another Monastery at the 
mouth of the River Don, were assail'd by the English, their chief 
Captain slain on the place; then returning to sea, were most of them 
shipwreck'd; others driven again on shore, were put all to the Sword.  
Simeon attributes this their Punishment to the power of St. Cuthbert, 
offended with them for the rifling his Convent.  Two years after 
this,220. died Ethelred twice King, but not exempted at last from the 
fate of many of his Predecessors, miserably slain by his People,221. 
some say deservedly, as not inconscious with them who train'd Osred to 
his ruin.  Osbald a Nobleman exalted to the Throne, and, in less then a 
Month, deserted and expell'd, was forc'd to fly from Lindisfarne by Sea 
to the Pictish King, and died an Abbot.  Eardulf, whom Ethelred six 
years before had commanded to be put to death at Ripun, before the 
Abbey-Gate, dead as was suppos'd, and with solemn Dirge carried into the 
Church, after midnight found there alive, I read not how, then banish'd, 
now recall'd, was in York created King.  In Kent, Ethelbert or Pren, 
whom the Annals call Eadbright (so different they often are one from 
another, both in timing and in naming) by some means having usurp'd 
Regal Power, after two years Reign contending with Kenulf the Mercian, 
was by him taken prisoner, and soon after out of pious Commiseration let 
go: but not received of his own, what became of him, Malmsbury leaves in 
doubt.  Simeon writes, that Kenulf commanded to put out his eyes, and 
lop off his hands; but whether the Sentence were executed or not, is 
left as much in doubt by his want of Expression.  The second Year after 
this222. they in Northumberland who had conspired against Ethelred, now 
also raising War against Eardulf,223. under Wada their Chief Captain, 
after much havock on either side at Langho, by Whaley in Lancashire, the 
Conspirators at last flying, Eardulf return'd with Victory.  The same 
year London, with a great multitude of her Inhabitants, by a sudden Fire 
was consum'd.  The year 800 made way for great Alteration in 
England,224. uniting her seven Kingdoms into one, by Ecbert the famous 
West-Saxon; him Birthric dying childless left next to reign, the only 
Survivor of that Lineage, descended from Inegild the Brother of King 
Ina.225.  And according to his Birth liberally bred, he began early from 
his Youth to give signal hopes of more then ordinary worth growing up in 
him; which Birthric fearing, and withal his juster Title to the Crown, 
secretly sought his Life, and Ecbert perceiving, fled to Offa, the 
Mercian: but he having married Eadburg his Daughter to Birthric, easily 
gave ear to his Embassadors coming to require Ecbert:226. He again put 
to his shifts, escap'd thence into France; but after three years 
Banishment there, which perhaps contributed much to his Education, 
Charles the Great then reigning, he was call'd over by the public Voice 
(for Birthric was newly dead) and with general Applause created King of 
West-Saxons.  The same day Ethelmund at Kinnersford passing over with 
the Worcestershire Men, was met by Weolstan another Nobleman with those 
of Wiltshire, between whom happened a great fray, wherin the Wiltshire 
Men overcame, but both Dukes were slain, no reason of their Quarrel 
written; such bickerings to recount met often in these our Writers, what 
more worth is it then to chronicle the Wars of Kites or Crows, flocking 
and fighting in the Air?  The year following Eardulf the 
Northumbrian227. leading forth an Army against Kenwulf the Mercian for 
harbouring certain of his Enemies,228. by the diligent Mediation of 
other Princes and Prelates, Arms were laid aside, and Amity soon sworn 
between them.  But Eadburga the Wife of Birthric,229. a Woman every way 
wicked, in Malice especially cruel,230. could not or car'd not to 
appease the general Hatred justly conceiv'd against her; accustom'd in 
her Husband's day, to accuse any whom she spighted; and not prevailing 
to his Ruin, her practice was by Poison secretly to contrive his 
Death.231.  It fortun'd,232. that the King her Husband lighting on a Cup 
which she had temper'd, not for him, but for one of his great 
Favourites, whom she could not harm by accusing, sip'd therof only, and 
in a while after still pining away, ended his days; the Favourite 
drinking deeper, found speedier the Operation.  She fearing to be 
question'd for these Facts, with what Treasure she had, pass'd over Sea 
to Charles the Great, whom with rich Gifts coming to his Presence, the 
Emperor courtly receiv'd with this pleasant Proposal: Choose, Eadburga, 
which of us two thou wilt, me or my Son (for his Son stood by him) to be 
thy Husband.  She no Dissembler of what she lik'd best, made easy 
Answer: Were it in my choice, I should choose of the two your Son 
rather, as the younger Man.  To whom the Emperor, between jest and 
earnest, Hadst thou chosen me, I had bestow'd on thee by Son; but since 
thou hast chosen him, thou shalt have neither him nor me.  Nevertheless 
he assign'd her a rich Monastery to dwell in as Abbess; for that Life it 
may seem she chose next to profess: but being a while after detected of 
Unchastity with one of her Followers, she was commanded to depart 
thence; from that time wandring poorly up and down with one Servant, in 
Pavia a City of Italy, she finish'd at last in beggary her shameful 
Life.  In the year 805 Cuthred,233. whom Kenulf the Mercian had, instead 
of Pren,234. made King in Kent, having obscurely reign'd 8 years, 
deceas'd.235.  In Northumberland, Eardulf the Year following236. was 
driven out of his Realm by Alfwold, who reign'd two years in his 
room;237. after whom Eandred Son of Eardulf 33 years; but I see not how 
this can stand with the Sequel of Story out of better Authors:238. Much 
less that which Buchanan relates,239. the year following, of Achaius 
King of Scots,240. who having reign'd 32 years, and dying in 809,241. 
had formerly aided (but in what year of his Reign tells not) Hungus King 
of Picts with 10,000 Scots, against Athelstan a Saxon or English-man, 
then wasting the Pictish Borders; that Hungus by aid of those Scots, and 
the help of St. Andrew their Patron, in a vision by night, and the 
appearance of his Cross by day, routed the astonished English, and slew 
Athelstan in fight.  Who this Athelstan was, I believe no Man knows; 
Buchanan supposes him to have been some Danish Commander, on whom King 
Alured or Alfred had bestow'd Northumberland; but of this I find no 
Footstep in our antient Writers; and if any such thing were done in the 
time of Alfred, it must be little less then 100 years after: this 
Athelstan therfore, and this great Overthrow, seems rather to have been 
the fancy of some Legend then any warrantable Record.242.  Mean while 
Ecbert having with much Prudence, Justice and Clemency,243. a work of 
more then one year, establish'd his Kingdom and himself244. in the 
Affections of his People, turns his first Enterprise against the 
Britains, both them of Cornwal and those beyond Severn, subduing both.  
In Mercia, Kenulf the 6th year after having reign'd with great Praise of 
his religious Mind and Vertues both in Peace and War, deceas'd.245.  His 
Son Kenelm, a Child of seven Years, was committed to the care of his  
elder Sister Quendrid;246. who with a female Ambition aspiring to the 
Crown, hir'd one who had the charge of his Nurture to murder him, led 
into a woody place upon pretence of hunting.247.  The Murder, as is 
reported, was miracuously reveal'd; but to tell how, by a Dove dropping 
a written Note on the Altar at Rome, is a long Story, told, though out 
of order, by Malmsbury, and under the year 821 by Mat. West. where I 
leave it to be sought by such as are more credulous then I wish my 
Readers.  Only the Note was to this purpose:

Low in a Mead of Kine under a Thorn,
Of Head bereft, lieth poor Kenelm King-born.

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">Keolwulf the Brother of Kenulf, after one Year's Reign was driven 
out by one Bernulf an Usurper;248. who in his third Year,249. uncertain 
whether invading or invaded, was by Ecbert, though with great Loss on 
both sides, overthrown and put to flight at Ellandune or Wilton:250. yet 
Malmsbury accounts this Battel fought in 806, a wide difference, but 
frequently found in their Computations.251.  Bernulf thence retiring to 
the East-Angles, as part of his Dominion by the late seizure of Offa, 
was by them met in the Field and slain: but they doubting what the 
Mercians might do in revenge hereof, forthwith yielded themselves both 
King and People to the Sovereignty of Ecbert.  As for the Kings of East-
Angles, our Annals mention them not since Ethelwald; him succeeded his 
Brother's Sons,252. as we find in Malmsbury, Aldulf (a good King, well 
acquainted with Bede ) and Elwold who left the Kingdom to Beorn, he to 
Ethelred the Father of Ethelbrite, whom Offa perfidiously put to 
death.253.  Simeon and Hoveden, in the Year 749, write that Elfwald King 
of East-Angles dying, Humbeanna and Albert shar'd the Kingdom between 
them; but where to insert this among the former Successions is not easy, 
nor much material: after Ethelbrite, none is nam'd of that Kingdom till 
their submitting now to Ecbert: he from this Victory against Bernulf 
sent part of his Army under Ethelwulf his Son, with Alstan Bishop of 
Shirburn, and Wulferd a Chief Commander, into Kent.  Who finding Baldred 
there reigning in his 18th Year, overcame and drove him over the Thames; 
wherupon all Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and lastly Essex, with her King 
Swithred, became subject to the Dominion of Ecbert.  Neither were these 
all his Expolits of this Year, the first in order set down in Saxon 
Annals, being his Fight against the Devonshire Welch, at a place call'd 
Gafulford, now Camelford in Cornwal.254.  Ludiken the Mercian, after two 
years preparing to avenge Bernulf his Kinsman on the East-Angles, 255. 
was by them with his five Consuls, as the Annals call them, surpriz'd 
and put to the Sword:256. and Withlaf his Successor first vanquish'd, 
then upon Submission with all Mercia, made tributary to Ecbert.  Mean 
while the Northumbrian Kingdom of it self was fallen to shivers; their 
Kings one after another so often slain by the People, no Man daring, 
though never so ambitious, to take up the Scepter which many had found 
so hot, (the only effectual cure of Ambition that I have read) for the 
space of 33 Years after the Death of Ethelred Son of Mollo, as Malmsbury 
writes, there was no King: many Noblemen and Prelates were fled the 
Country.  Which Mis-rule among them the Danes having understood, oft-
times from their Ships entering far into the Land, infested those parts 
with wide Depopulation, wasting Towns, Churches, and Monasteries, for 
they were yet Heathen: The Lent before whose coming, on the North-side 
of St. Peter's Church in York, was seen from the Roof to rain Blood.  
The Causes of these Calamities, and the Ruin of that Kingdom, Alcuin, a 
learned Monk living in those days, attributes in several Epistles, and 
well may, to the general Ignorance and Decay of Learning, which crept in 
among them after the death of Beda, and of Ecbert the Archbishop; their 
neglect of breeding up Youth in the Scriptures, the spruce and gay 
Apparel of their Priests and Nuns, discovering their vain and wanton 
minds.  Examples are also read, even in Beda's days, of their wanton 
deeds: thence Altars defil'd with Perjuries, Cloisters violated with 
Adulteries, the Land polluted with the Blood of their Princes, civil 
Dissensions among the People; and finally, all the same Vices which 
Gildas alledg'd of old to have ruin'd the Britains.  In this estate 
Ecbert, who had now conquer'd all the South,257. finding them in the 
year 827, (for he was march'd thither with an Army to compleat his 
Conquest of the whole Island) no wonder if they submitted themselves to 
the Yoke without resistance, Eandred their King becoming tributary.258.  
Thence turning his Forces the year following he subdu'd more throughly 
what remain'd of North Wales.259.

THE

HISTORY

OF

B R I T A I N.

------------------------------------------------------------
THE   FIFTH   BOOK.
------------------------------------------------------------

The sum of things in this Island, or the best part theof, reduc'd now 
under the Power of one man, and him one of the worthiest, which as far 
as can be found in good Authors, was by none attain'd at any time here 
before, unless in Fables; Men might with some reason have expected from 
such union, peace and plenty, greatness, and the flourishing of all 
estates and degrees: but far the contrary fell out soon after, invasion, 
spoil, desolation, slaughter of many, slavery of the rest, by the 
forcible landing of a fierce Nation; Danes commonly call'd, and 
sometimes Dacians by others, the same with Normans; as barbarous as the 
Saxons themselves were at first reputed, and much more, for the Saxons 
first invited came hither to dwell; these unsent for, unprovok'd, came 
only to destroy.1.  But if the Saxons, as is above related, came most of 
them from Jutland and Anglen, a part of Denmark, as Danish writers 
affirm, and that Danes and Normans are the same; then in this Invasion, 
Danes drove out Danes, their own Posterity.  And Normans afterwards, 
none but ancienter Normans.2.  Which invasion perhaps, had the Heptarchy 
stood divided as it was, had either not been attempted, or not uneasily 
resisted; while each Prince and People, excited by their nearest 
concernments, had more industriously defended their own bounds, then 
depending on the neglect of a deputed Governour, sent oft-times from the 
remote residence of a secure Monarch.  Though as it fell out in those 
troubles, the lesser Kingdoms revolting from the West-Saxon yoke, and 
not aiding each other, too much concerned for their own safety, it came 
to no better pass; while severally they sought to repel the danger nigh 
at hand, rather then jointly to prevent it far off.  But when God hath 
decreed serviturde on a sinful Nation, fitted by their own Vices for no 
condition but servile, all Estates of Government are alike unable to 
avoid it.  God had purpos'd to punish our instrumental punishers, though 
now Christians, by other Heathen, according to his Divine Retaliation; 
invasion for invasion, spoil for spoil, destruction for destruction.  
The Saxons were now full as wicked as the Britainswere at their arrival, 
broken with Luxury and Sloth, either secular or superstitious; for 
laying aside the exercise of Arms, and the study of all virtuous 
Knowledge, some betook them to over-worldly or vicious practice, others 
to religious idleness and solitude, which brought forth nothing but vain 
and delusive Visions; easily perceiv'd such by their commanding of 
things, either not belonging to the Gospel, or utterly forbidden, 
Ceremonies, Reliques, Monasteries, Masses, Idols; add to these 
ostentation of Alms, got oft-times by rapine and oppression, or 
intermixt with violent and lustful deeds, sometimes prodigally bestow'd 
as the expiation of Cruelty and Bloodshed.  What longer suffering could 
there be, when Religion it self grew so void of sincerity, and the 
greatest shews of Purity were impur'd?

ECBERT.

Ecbert in full height of Glory, having now enjoy'd his Conquest seven 
peaceful years, his victorious Army long since disbanded, and the 
exercise of Arms perhaps laid aside, the more was found unprovided 
against a sudden storm of Danes from the Sea,3. who landing in the 32d 
of his Reign, wasted Shepey in Kent.4.  Ecbert the next year, gathering 
an Army,5. for he had heard of their arrival in 35 Ships, gave them 
Battel by the River Carr in Dorsetshire;6. the event wherof was, that 
the Danes kept their ground, and encamp'd where the Field was fought; 
two Saxon Leaders, Dudda and Osmund, and two Bishops, as some say, were 
there slain.  This was the only check of Fortune we read of, that Ecbert 
in all his time receiv'd.  For the Danes returning two years after7. 
with a great Navy, and joining Forces with the Cornish,8. who had 
enter'd League with them, were overthrown and put to flight.  Of these 
Invasions against Ecbert, the Danish History is not silent;9. whether 
out of their own Records or ours, may be justly doubted: for of these 
times at home, I find them in much uncertainty, and beholden rather to 
Out-landish Chronicles, then any Records of their own.  The Victor 
Ecbert, as one who had done enough, seasonably now, after prosperous 
success, the next year with glory ended his days,10. and was buried at 
Winchester.11. 

ETHELWOLF.

Ethelwolf the Son of Ecbert succeeded, by Malmsbury describ'd a man of 
mild Nature, not inclin'd to War, or delighted with much Dominion; that 
therfore contented with the ancient West-Saxon Bounds, he gave to 
Ethelstan his Brother, or Son, as some write, the Kingdom of Kent and 
Essex.  But the Saxon Annalist,12. whose Authority is elder, saith 
plainly, that both these Countries and Sussex, were bequeath'd to 
Ethelstan by Ecbert his Father.  The unwarlike disposition of Ethelwolf 
gave encouragement no doubt, and easier entrance to the Danes, who came 
again the next year with 33 Ships;13. but Wulfheard, one of the King's 
chief Captains, drove them back at Southampton with great slaughter;14. 
himself dying the same year, of Age, as I suppose, for he seems to have 
bin one of Ecbert's old Commanders, who was sent with Ethelwolf to 
subdue Kent.  Ethelhelm another of the King's Captains, with the 
Dorsetshire men, had at first like success against the Danes at 
Portsmouth; but they reinforcing stood their ground, and put the English 
to rout.  Worse was the success of Earl Herebert at a place call'd 
Mereswar, slain with the most part of his Army.  The year following in 
Lindsey also,15. East-Angles, and Kent, much mischief was done by their 
landing;16. where the next year,17. embolden'd by success, they came on 
as far as Canterbury, Rochester, and London it self,18. with no less 
cruel Hostility: and giving no respite to the peaceable mind of 
Ethelwolf, they yet return'd with the next year in 35 Ships,19. fought 
with him, as before with his Father at the River Carr, and made good 
their ground.20.  In Northumberland, Eandred the Tributary King 
deceasing,21. left the same Tenure to his Son Ethelred driven out in his 
fourth year,22. and succeeded by Readwulf,23. who soon after his 
Coronation hasting forth to Battel against the Danes at Alvetheli, fell 
with the most part of his Army; and Ethelred like in fortune to the 
former Ethelred, was re-exalted to his Seat.  And to be yet further like 
him in Fate, was slain the fourth year after.  Osbert succeeded in his 
room.24.  But more southerly, the Danes next year after met with some 
stop in the full course of their outragious Insolencies.25.  For Earnulf 
with the men of Somerset, Alstan the Bishop, and Osric with those of 
Dorsetshire, setting upon them at the River's mouth of Pedridan, 
slaughter'd them in great numbers, and obtain'd a just Victory.  This 
repulse quell'd them, for aught we hear, the space of six years;26. then 
also renewing their Invasion with little better success.27.  For Keorle 
an Eart,28. aided with the Forces of Devonshire, assaulted and overthrew 
them at Wigganbeaorch with great Destruction; as prosperously were they 
fought with the same year at Sandwich, by King Ethelstan, and Ealker his 
General, their great Army defeated, and nine of their Ships taken, the 
rest driven off; however to ride out the Winter on that shore, Asser 
saith, they then first winter'd in Shepey Isle.  Hard it is, through the 
bad expression of these Writers, to define this Fight, whether by Sea or 
Land; Hoveden terms it a Sea-fight.  Nevertheless with 50 Ships29. 
(Asser and others add 300)30. they entred the mouth of the Thames, and 
made Excursions as far as Canterbury and London, and as Ethelwerd 
writes, destroy'd both; of London, Asser signifies only that they 
pillag'd it.  Bertulf also the Mercian, Successor of Withlaf, with all 
his Army they forc'd to fly, and him beyond the Sea.  Then passing over 
Thames with their Powers into Surrey, and the West-Saxons, and meeting 
there with King Ethelwolf and Ethelbald his Son, at a place call'd Ak-
Lea, or Oke-Lea, they received a total Defeat with memorable Slaughter.  
This was counted a lucky year to England,31. and brought to Ethelwolf 
great Reputation.32.  Burhed therfore,33. who after Bertulf held of him 
the Mercian Kingdon, two years after this, imploring his Aid against the 
North-Welch, as then troublesome to his confines, obtain'd it of him in 
person, and therby reduc'd them to Obedience.  This done, Ethelwolf sent 
his Son Alfrid a Child of five years, well accompanied to Rome, whom Leo 
the Pope both consecrated to be King afterwards, and adopted to be his 
Son; at home Ealker with the Forces of Kent, and Huda with those of 
Surrey, fell on the Danes at their landing in Tanet, and at first put 
them back; but the slain and drown'd were at length so many on either 
side, as left the loss equal on both: which yet hinder'd not the 
Solemnity of a Marriage at the Feast of Easter, between Burhed the 
Mercian, and Ethelswida King Ethelwolf's Daughter.34.  Howbeit the Danes 
the next year35. winter'd again in Shepey.36.  Whom Ethelwolf, not 
finding human Health sufficient to resist, growing daily upon him, in 
hope of Divine Aid, register'd in a Book and dedicated to God the tenth 
part of his own Lands, and of his whole Kingdom, eas'd of all 
Impositions, but converted to the maintenance of Masses and Psalms 
weekly to be sung for the prospering of Ethelwolf and his Captains, as 
appears at large by the Patent it self, in William of Malmsbury.  Asser 
saith, he did it for the Redemption of his Soul, and the Soul of his 
Ancestors.  After which, as having done some great matter to shew 
himself at Rome, and be applauded of the Pope, he takes a long and 
cumbersome Journey thither with young Alfrid again, and there stays a 
year,37. when his place requir'd him rather here in the field against 
Pagan Enemies left wintring in his Land.38.  Yet so much Manhood he had, 
as to return thence no Monk; and in his way home took to Wife Judith 
Daughter to Charles the Bald, King of France.  But ere his return,39. 
Ethelbald his eldest Son, Alstan his trusty Bishop, and Enulf Earl of 
Somerset conspir'd against him; their Complaints were, that he had taken 
with him Alfrid his youngest Son to be there inaugurated King, and 
brought home with him an outlandish Wife; for which they endeavour'd to 
deprive him of his Kingdom.  The disturbance was expected to bring forth 
nothing less then War: but the King abhorring civil Discord, after many 
Conferences tending to Peace, condescended to divide the Kingdom with 
his Son; Division was made, but the matter so carried, that the Eastern 
and worst part was malignly afforded to the Father; the Western and best 
given to the Son: at which many of the Nobles had great indignation, 
offering to the King their utmost Assistance for the recovery of all; 
whom he peacefully dissuading, sat down contented with his Portion 
assign'd.  In the East-Angles, Edmund lineal from the ancient stock of 
those Kings, a Youth of 14 years only, but of great hopes, was with 
consent of all but his own crown'd at Bury.  About this time, as 
Buchanan relates,40. the Picts, who not long before had by the Scots 
been driven out of their Country, part of them coming to Osbert and 
Ella, then Kings of Northumberland, obtain'd Aid against Donaldus the 
Scotish King, to recover their ancient Possession.  Osbert, first put to 
a Retreat; but returning soon after on the Scots, over-secure of their 
suppos'd Victory, put them to flight with great slaughter, took prisoner 
their King, and pursu'd his Victory beyond Stirling-bridge.  The Scots 
unable to resist longer, and by Embassadors entreating Peace, had it 
granted them on these conditions: The Scots were to quit all they had 
possess'd within the Wall of Severus: the limits of Scotland were 
beneath Stirling-bridge to be the River Forth, and on the other side, 
Dunbritton Frith; from that time so call'd of the British then seated in 
Cumberland, who had join'd with Osbert in this Action, and so far 
extended on that side the British Limits.  If this be true, as the Scots 
Writers themselves witness (and who would think them fabulous to the 
disparagement of their own Country?) how much wanting have been our 
Historians to their Country's Honour, in letting pass unmention'd an 
Exploit so memorable, by them remembred and attested, who are wont 
oftner to extenuate then to amplify aught done in Scotland by the 
English?  Donaldus on these conditions releas'd, soon after dies, 
according to Buchanan, in 858.  Ethelwolf Chief King in England, had the 
year before ended his Life, and was buried as his Father at Winchester.  
He was from his Youth much addicted to Devotion;41. so that in his 
Father's time he was ordain'd Bishop of Winchester; and unwillingly, for 
want of other legitimate Issue, succeeded him in the Throne; managing 
therfore his greatest Affairs by the Activity of two Bishops, Alstan of 
Sherburne, and Swithine of Winchester.  But Alstan is noted of 
Covetousness and Oppression,42. by William of Malmsbury; the more 
vehemently no doubt for doing some notable damage to that Monastery.43.  
The same Author writes, that Ethelwolf at Rome, paid a Tribute to the 
Pope, continu'd to his days.44.  However he were facil to his Son, and 
seditious Nobles, in yielding up part of his Kingdom, yet his Queen he 
treated not the less honourably, for whomsoever it displeas'd.45.  The 
West-Saxons had decreed ever since the time of Eadburga, the infamous 
Wife of Birthric, that no Queen should sit in State with the King, or be 
dignify'd with the Title of Queen.  But Ethelwolf permitted not that 
Judith his Queen should lose any point of Regal State by that Law.  At 
his Death, he divided the Kingdom between his two Sons, Ethelbald and 
Ethelbert; to the younger Kent, Essex, Surrey, Sussex, to the elder all 
the rest; to Peter and Paul certain Revenues yearly, for what uses let 
others relate, who write also his Pedigree, from Son to Father, up to 
Adam.

ETHELBALD, and ETHELBERT.

Ethelbald, unnatural and disloyal to his Father,46. fell justly into 
another, though contrary Sin,47. of too much love to his Father's Wife; 
and whom at first he oppos'd coming into the Land, her now unlawfully 
marrying,48. he takes into his Bed; but not long enjoying, died at three 
years end, without doing aught more worthy to be remember'd; having 
reign'd two years with his Father,49. impiously usurping, and three 
after him, as unworthily inheriting.50.  And his hap was all that while 
to be unmolested with the Danes; not of Divine Favour doubtless, but to 
his greater Condemnation, living the more securely his incestuous Life.  
Huntingdon on the other side much praises Ethelbald, and writes him 
buried at Sherburn, with great sorrow of the People, who miss'd him long 
after.  Mat. Westm. saith, that he repented of his Incest with Judith, 
and dismiss'd her: but Asser an Eye-witness of those times, mentions no 
such thing.

ETHELBERT alone.

Ethelbald by Death removed, the whole Kingdom came rightfully to 
Ethelbert his next Brother.  Who though a Prince of great virtue and no 
blame, had as short a Reign allotted him as his faulty Brother, nor that 
so peaceful; once or twice invaded by the Danes.  But they having landed 
in the West with a great Army, and sack'd Winchester, were met by 
OsricEarl of Southampton, and Ethelwolf of Berkshire, beaten to their 
Ships, and forc'd to leave their Booty.  Five Years after,51. about the 
time of his Death, they set foot again in Tanet;52. the Kentish-men 
wearied out with so frequent Alarms, came to agreement with them for a 
certain Sum of Money; but ere the Peace could be ratify'd, and the Money 
gather'd, the Danes impatient of delay, by a sudden Eruption in the 
night, soon wasted all the East of Kent.  Mean while or something 
before, Ethelbert  deceasing, was buried as his Brother at Sherburn.

ETHELRED.

Ethelred the third, Son to Ethelwolf, at his first coming to the 
Crown53. was entertain'd with a fresh Invasion of Danes,54. led by 
Hinguar and Hubba, two Brothers, who now had got footing among the East-
Angles;55. there they winter'd, and coming to terms of Peace with the 
Inhabitants, furnish'd themselves of Horses, forming by that means many 
Troops with Riders of their own: These Pagans, Asser saith, came from 
the River Danubius.  Fitted thus for a long Expedition, they ventur'd 
the next Year to make their way over Land and over Humber, as far as 
York,56. them they found to their hands imbroil'd in civil 
Dissensions;57. their King Osbert they had thrown out, and Ella Leader 
of another Faction chosen in his room; who both, though late, admonish'd 
by their common danger, towards the year's end with united Powers made 
head against the Danes and prevail'd; but pursuing them over-eagerly 
into York,58. then but slenderly wall'd, the Northumbrians were every 
where slaughter'd, both within and without; their Kings also both slain, 
their City burnt, saith Malmsbury, the rest as they could made their 
Peace, over-run and vanquish'd as far as the River Tine, and Egbert of 
English Race appointed King over them.  Bromton no ancient Author (for 
he wrote since Mat. West. ) nor of much credit, writes a particular 
cause of the Danes coming to York: that Bruern a Nobleman, whose Wife 
King Osbert had ravish'd, call'd in Hinguar and Hubba to revenge him.  
The Example is remarkable, if the Truth were as evident.  Thence 
victorious, the Danes next year59. enter'd into Mercia towards 
Nottingham, where they spent the Winter.  Burhed the King of that 
Country, unable to resist, implores the Aid of Ethelred and young Alfred 
his Brother; they assembling their Forces and joining with the Mercians 
about Nottingham, offer Battel:60. the Danes not daring to come forth, 
kept themselves within that Town and Castle, so that no great Fight was 
hazarded there; at length the Mercians weary of long Suspense, enter'd 
into Conditions of Peace with their Enemies.  After which the Danes 
returning back to York, made their Abode there the space of one Year,61. 
committing, some say, many Cruelties.62.  Thence embarking to Lindsey, 
and all the Summer destroying that Country,63. about September they came 
with like Fury into Kesteven,  another part of Lincolnshire,64. where 
Algar the Earl of Howland, now Holland, with his Forces, and two hundred 
stout Soldiers belonging to the Abbey of Croiland, three hundred from 
about Boston, Morcard Lord of Brunne, with his numerous Family, well 
train'd and arm'd: Osgot Governour of Lincoln with 500 of that City, all 
joining together, gave battel to the Danes, slew of them a great 
multitude, with three of their Kings, and pursu'd the rest to their 
Tents; but the Night following Gothrun, Baseg, Osketil, Halfden, and 
Hamond, five Kings, and as many Earls, Frena, Hinguar, Hubba, Sidroc the 
elder and younger, coming in from several parts with great Forces and 
Spoils, great part of the English began to slink home.  Nevertheless 
Algar with such as forsook him not, all next day in order of Battel 
facing the Danes, and sustaining unmov'd the brunt of their Assaults, 
could not with-hold his Men at last from pursuing their counterfeited 
Flight; wherby open'd and disorder'd, they fell into the Snare of their 
Enemies, rushing back upon them.  Algar and those Captains fore-nam'd 
with him, all resolute Men, retreating to a Hill side, and slaying of 
such as follow'd them, manifold their own number, died at length upon 
heaps of dead which they had made round about them.  The Danes thence 
passing on into the Country of East-Angles, rifled and burnt the 
Monastery of Elie, overthrew Earl Wulketul with his whole Army, and 
lodg'd out the Winter at Thetford; where King Edmond assailing them, was 
with his whole Army put to flight, himself taken, bound to a stake, and 
shot to death with Arrows, his whole Country subdu'd.  The next year65. 
with great Supplies, saith Huntingdon, bending their march toward the 
West-Saxons,66. the only People now left in whom might seem yet to 
remain Strength of Courage likely to oppose them, they came to Reading, 
fortify'd there between the two Rivers of Thames and Kenet, and about 
three days after sent out Wings of Horse under two Earls to forage the 
Country;67. but Ethelwolf Earl of Berkshire, at Englefield a Village 
nigh, encounter'd them, slew one of their Earls, and obtain'd a great 
Victory.  Four days after came the King himself and his Brother Alfred 
with the main Battel; and the Danes issuing forth, a bloody Fight began, 
on either side great Slaughter in which Earl Ethelwolf lost his Life; 
but the Danes losing no ground, kept their place of standing to the end.  
Neither did the English for this make less haste to another Conflict at 
Escesdune or Ashdown, four days after, where both Armies with their 
whole Force on either side met.  The Danes were embattail'd in two great 
Bodies, the one led by Bascai and Halfden, their two Kings, the other by 
such Earls as were appointed; in like manner the English divided their 
Powers, Ethelred the King stood against their Kings; and though on the 
lower ground, and coming later into the Battel from his Orisons, gave a 
fierce Onset, wherein Bascai (the Danish History names him Ivarus the 
Son of Regnerus ) was slain.  Alfred was plac'd against the Earls, and 
beginning the Battel ere his Brother came into the Field, with such 
Resolution charg'd them, that in the shock most of them were slain; they 
are named Sidroc elder and younger, Osbern, Frean, Harald; at length in 
both Divisions, the Danes turn their backs; many thousands of them cut 
off, the rest pursu'd till night.  So much the more it may be wonder'd 
to hear next in the Annals, that the Danes 14 days after such an 
Overthrow fighting again with Ethelred and his Brother Alfred at Basing, 
under Conduct, saith the Danish History, of Agnerus and Hubbo, Brothers 
of the slain Ivarus, should obtain the Victory; especially since the new 
Supply of Danes mentioned by Asser, arriv'd after this Action.68.  But 
after two Months the King and his Brother fought with them again at 
Mertun, in two Squadrons as before, in which Fight hard it is to 
understand who had the better; so darkly do the Saxon Annals deliver 
their meaning with more then wonted Infancy.  Yet these I take (for 
Asser is here silent) to be the chief Fountain of our Story, the Ground 
and Basis upon which the Monks later in time gloss and comment at their 
pleasure.  Nevertheless it appears that on the Saxon part, not Heamund 
the Bishop only, but many valiant Men lost their Lives.  This Fight was 
follow'd by a heavy Summer Plague;69. wherof, as is thought, King 
Ethelred died in the fifth of his Reign, and was buried at Winburne, 
where his Epitaph inscribes that he had his Death's Wound by the Danes, 
according to the Danish History 872.  Of all these terrible Landings and 
Devastations by the Danes, from the days of Ethelwolf till their two 
last Battels with Ethelred, or of their Leaders, whether Kings, Dukes, 
or Earls, the Danish History of best credit saith nothing; so little Wit 
or Conscience it seems they had to leave any Memory of their brutish 
rather then manly Actions; unless we shall suppose them to have come, as 
above was cited out of Asser, from Danubius, rather then from Denmark, 
more probably some barbarous Nation of Prussia, or Livonia, not long 
before seated more Northward on the Baltic Sea.

ALFRED.

Alfred the fourth Son of Ethelwolf, had scarce perform'd his Brother's 
Obsequies, and the Solemnity of his own Crowning, when at the Month's 
end in haste with a small Power he encounter'd the whole Army of Danes 
at Witton, and most part of the day foil'd them; but unwarily following 
the Chase, gave others of them the advantage to rally; who returning 
upon him now weary, remain'd Masters of the Field.  This year, as is 
affirm'd in the Annals, nine Battels had been fought against the Danes 
on the South-side of Thames, besides innumerable Excursions made by 
Alfred and other Leaders; one King, nine Earls were fallen in fight, so 
that weary on both sides at the year's end, League or Truce was 
concluded.  Yet next year70. the Danes took their March to London,71. 
now expos'd to their Prey, there they winter'd, and thither came the 
Mercians to renew Peace with them.  The year following they rov'd back 
to the parts beyond Humber, but winter'd at Torksey in Lincolnshire, 
where the Mercians now the third time made Peace with them.  
Notwithstanding which, removing their Camp to Rependune in Mercia, now 
Repton upon Trent in Derbeyshire, and there wintering,72. they 
constrain'd Burhed the King to fly into foreign parts,73. making seizure 
of his Kingdom,74. he running the direct way to Rome; with better reason 
then his Ancestors, died there,75. and was buried in a Church by the 
English School.76.  His Kingdom the Danes farm'd out to Kelwulf, one of 
his Houshold Servants or Officers, with condition to be resign'd them 
when they commanded.  From Rependune they dislodg'd, Hafden their King 
leading part of his Army Northward, winter'd by the River Tine,77. and 
subjecting all those quarters, wasted also the Picts and British 
beyond:78. but Guthrun, Oskitell, and Anwynd, other three of their 
Kings, moving from Rependune, came with a great Army to Grantbrig, and 
remain'd there a whole year.  But Alfred that Summer purposing to try 
his Fortune with a Fleet at Sea (for he had found that the want of 
shipping and neglect of Navigation had expos'd the Land to these 
Piracies) met with seven Danish Rovers, took one, the rest escaping; an 
acceptable Success from so small a beginning: for the English at that 
time were but little experienc'd in Sea-Affairs.  The next year's first 
motion79. of the Danes was towards Warham- Castle, where Alfred meeting 
them, either by Policy, or their doubt of his Power;80. Ethelwerd saith, 
by Money brought them to such terms of Peace, as that they swore to him 
upon a hallow'd Bracelet, others say upon certain Reliques81. (a solemn 
Oath it seems, which they never vouchsaf'd before to any other Nation) 
forthwith to depart the Land: but falsifying that Oath, by night with 
all the Horse they had (Asser saith, slaying all the Horsemen he had) 
stole to Exeter,82. and there winter'd.  In Northumberland, Hafden their 
King began to settle, to divide the Land, to till, and to inhabit.  Mean 
while they in the West who but their Fleet the next year83. sailing or 
rowing about the West,84. met with such a Tempest near to Swanswich or 
Gnavewic, as wrack'd 120 of their Ships, and left the rest easy to be 
master'd by those Galleys which Alfred had set there to guard the Seas, 
and straiten Exeter of Provision.85.  He the while beleaguering them in 
the City, now humbled with the loss of their Navy, (two Navies, saith 
Asser, the one at Gnavewic, the other at Swanwine ) distress'd them so, 
as that they gave him as many Hostages as he requir'd, and as many 
Oaths, to keep their covenanted Peace, and kept it.  For the Summer 
coming on, they departed into Mercia, wherof part they divided among 
themselves, part left to Kelwulf their substituted King.  The Twelftide 
following,86. all Oaths forgotten, they came to Chippenham in Wiltshire, 
dispeopling the Countries round,87. dispossessing some, driving others 
beyond the Sea; Alfred himself with a small Company was forc'd to keep 
within Woods and Fenny Places, and for some time all alone, as Florent 
saith, sojourn'd with Dunwulf a Swine-herd, made afterwards for his 
Devotion and Aptness to Learning Bishop of Winchester.  Hafden and the 
Brother of Hinguar coming with 23 Ships from North-Wales,88. where they 
had made great spoil, landed in Devonshire, nigh to a strong Castle 
nam'd Kinwith; where, by the Garison issuing forth unexpectedly, they 
were slain with 12 hundred of their Men.89.  Mean while the King about 
Easter, not despairing of his Affairs, built a Fortress at a place 
call'd Athelney in Somersetshire, therin valiantly defending himself and 
his Followers, frequently sallying forth.  The 7th Week after he rode 
out to a place call'd Ecbryt-stone in the East part of Selwood: thither 
resorted to him with much Gratulation the Somerset and Wiltshire Men, 
with many out of Hampshire, some of whom a little before had feld their 
Country; with these marching to Ethandune, now Edindon in Wiltshire, he 
gave battel to the whole Danish Power, and put them to flight.90.  Then 
besieging their Castle, within fourteen days took it.  Malmsbury writes, 
that in this time of his Recess, to go a Spy into the Danish Camp, he 
took upon him with one Servant the Habit of a Fidler; by this means 
gaining access to the King's Table, and sometimes to his Bed-Chamber, 
got knowledge of their Secrets, their careless encamping, and therby 
this opportunity of assailing them on a sudden.  The Danes by this 
Misfortune broken, gave him more Hostages, and renew'd their Oaths to 
depart out of his Kingdom.  Their King Gytro or Gothrun offer'd 
willingly to receive Baptism, and accordingly came with 30 of his 
Friends to a place call'd Aldra or Aulre, near to Athelney, and were 
baptiz'd at Wedmore;91. where Alfred receiv'd him out of the Font, and 
nam'd him Athelstan.  After which they abode with him 12 days, and were 
dismiss'd with rich Presents.  Wherupon the Danes remov'd next year92. 
to Cirencester, thence peaceably to the East-Angles;93. which Alfred, as 
some write, had bestow'd on Gothrun to hold of him; the Bounds wherof 
may be read among the Laws of Alfred.  Others of them went to Fulham on 
the Thames, and joining there with a great Fleet newly come into the 
River, thence pass'd over into France and Flanders, both which they 
enter'd so far conquering or wasting, as witness'd sufficiently, that 
the French and Flemish were no more able then the English, by Policy or 
Prowess, to keep off that Danish Inundation from their Land.  Alfred 
thus rid of them, and intending for the future to prevent their landing; 
three years after94. (quiet the mean while) with more Ships and better 
provided,95. puts to Sea, and at first met with four of theirs, wherof 
two he took, throwing the men over-board, then with two others, wherin 
two were of their Princes, and took them also, but not without some loss 
of his own.  After three years96. another Fleet of them appear'd on 
these Seas, so huge that one part thought themselves sufficient to enter 
upon East France, the other came to Rochester,97. and beleaguer'd it, 
they within stoutly defending themselves till Alfred with great Forces, 
coming down upon the Danes, drove them to their Ships, leaving for haste 
all their Horses behind them.  The same year Alfred sent a Fleet toward 
the East-Angles,98. then inhabited by the Danes, which at the mouth of 
Stour, meeting with 16 Danish Ships, after some fight took them all, and 
slew all the Soldiers on board; but in their way home lying careless, 
were overtaken by another part of that Fleet, and came off with loss: 
wherupon perhaps those Danes who were settled among the East-Angles, 
erected with new hopes, violated the Peace which they had sworn to 
Alfred, who spent the next year in repairing London,99. (besieging, 
saith Huntingdon )100. much ruin'd and unpeopled by the Danes; the 
Londoners, all but those who had been led away Captive,101. soon 
return'd to their Dwellings,102. and Ethred Duke of Mercia, was by the 
King appointed their Governour.103.   But after 13 years respite of 
Peace, another Danish Fleet of 250 Sail, from the East part of France 
arriv'd at the mouth of a River in East Kent, call'd Lamen, nigh to the 
great Wood Andred, famous for length and breadth; into that Wood they 
drew up their Ships four mile from the River's mouth, and built a 
Fortress.  After whom Haesten, with another Danish Fleet of 80 Ships, 
entring the mouth of Thames, built a Fort at Middleton, the former Army 
remaining at a place call'd Apeltre.  Alfred perceiving this, took of 
those Danes who dwelt in Northumberland, a new Oath of Fidelity, and of 
those in Essex Hostages, lest they should join, as they were wont, with 
their Countrymen newly arriv'd.  And by the next year104. having got 
together his Forces,105. between either Army of the Danes encamp'd so as 
to be ready for either of them, who first should happen to stir forth; 
Troops of Horse also he sent continually abroad, assisted by such as 
could be spar'd from strong places, wherever the Countries wanted them, 
to encounter foraging parties of the Enemy.  The King also divided 
sometimes his whole Army, marching out with one part by turns, the other 
keeping intrench'd.  In conclusion rowling up and down, both sides met 
at Farnham in Surrey; where the Danes by Alfred's Horse Troops were put 
to flight, and crossing the Thames to a certain Island near Coln in 
Essex, or as Camden thinks, by Colebrook, were besieg'd there by Alfred 
till Provision fail'd the Besiegers, another part staid behind with 
their King wounded.  Mean while Alfred preparing to reinforce the Siege 
of Colney, the Danes of Northumberland breaking Faith, came by Sea to 
the East-Angles, and with a hundred Ships coasting Southward, landed in 
Devonshire, and besieg'd Exeter; thither Alfred hasted with his Powers, 
except a Squadron of Welch that came to London: with whom the Citizens 
marching forth to Beamslet, where Haesten the Dane had built a strong 
Fort, and left a Garison, while he himself with the main of his Army was 
enter'd far into the Country, luckily surprise the Fort, master the 
Garison, make prey of all they find there; their Ships also they burnt 
or brought away with good Booty, and many Prisoners, among whom the Wife 
and two Sons of Haesten were sent to the King, who forthwith set them at 
liberty.  Wherupon Haesten gave Oath of Amity and Hostages to the King; 
he in requital, whether freely or by agreement, a Sum of Money.  
Nevertheless without regard of Faith given, while Alfred was busied 
about Exeter, joining with the other Danish Army, he built another 
Castle in Essex at Shoberie, thence marching Westward by the Thames, 
aided with the Northumbrian and East-Anglish Danes, they came at length 
to Severn, pillaging all in their way.  But, Ethred, Ethelm, and 
Ethelnoth, the King's Captains, with united Forces pitch'd nigh to them 
at Buttingtun, on the Severn Bank in Montgomery-shire, the River running 
between, and there many Weeks attended;106. the King mean while blocking 
up the Danes who besieg'd Exeter, having eaten part of their Horses, the 
rest urg'd with Hunger broke forth to their Fellows, who lay encamp'd on 
the East-side of the River, and were all there discomfited with some 
loss of valiant Men on the King's party; the rest fled back to Essex, 
and their Fortress there.  Then Laf, one of their Leaders, gather'd 
before Winter a great Army of Northumbrian And East-Anglish Danes, who 
leaving their Money, Ships, and Wives with the East-Angles, and marching 
day and night, sat down before a City in the West call'd Wirheal near to 
Chester, and took it ere they could be overtaken.  The English after two 
days Siege, hopeless to dislodge them, wasted the Country round to cut 
off from them all Provision, and departed.  Soon after which, next 
year,107. the Danes no longer able to hold Wirheal, destitute of 
Victuals, enter'd North-Wales;108. thence laden with Spoils, part 
return'd into Northumberland, others to the East-Angles as far as Essex, 
where they seiz'd on a small Island call'd Meresig.  And here again the 
Annals record them to besiege Exeter, but without coherence of sense or 
story.109.  Others relate to this purpose,110. that returning by Sea 
from the Siege of Exeter, and in their way landing on the Coast of 
Sussex, they of Chichester sallied out and slew of them many hundreds, 
taking also some of their Ships.  The same year they who possess'd 
Meresig, intending to winter therabout, drew up their Ships, some into 
the Thames, others into the River Lee, and on the bank therof built a 
Castle twenty miles from London; to assault which, the Londoners aided 
with other Forces march'd out the Summer following,111. but were soon 
put to flight, losing four of the King's Captains.112.  Huntingdon 
writes quite the contrary, that these four were Danish Captains, and the 
overthrow theirs: but little Credit is to be plac'd in Huntingdon 
single.  For the King therupon with his Forces, lay encamp'd nearer the 
City, that the Danes might not infest them in time of Harvest; in the 
mean time, sutt'ly devising to turn Lee- stream several ways, wherby the 
Danish Bottoms were left on dry Ground: which they soon perceiving, 
march'd over Land to Quatbrig on the Severn, built a Fortress, and 
winter'd there; while their Ships left in Lee, were either broken or 
brought away by the Londoners; but their Wives and Children they had 
left in safety with the East-Angles.  The next year was pestilent,113. 
and besides the common sort took away many great Earls,114. Kelmond in 
Kent, Brithulf in Essex, Wulfred in Hampshire, with many others; and to 
this evil the Danes of Northumberland and East-Angles ceas'd not to 
endamage the West-Saxons, especially by stealth, robbing on the South-
shore in certain long Galleys.  But the King causing to be built others 
twice as long as usually were built, and some of 60 or 70 Oars higher, 
swifter and steddier then such as were in use before either with Danes 
or Frisons, his own Invention, some of these he sent out against six 
Danish Pirates, who had done much harm in the Isle of Wight, and parts 
adjoining.  The bickering was doubtful and intricate, part on the Water, 
part on the Sands; not without loss of some eminent men on the English 
side.  The Pirates at length were either slain or taken, two of them 
stranded; the men brought to Winchester, where the King then was, were 
executed by his command; one of them escap'd to the East-Angles, her men 
much wounded: the same year not fewer then twenty of their Ships 
perish'd on the South Coast with all their men.  And Rollo the Dane or 
Norman landing there, as Matt. West. writes, though not in what part of 
the Island, after an unsuccessful fight against those Forces which first 
oppos'd him, sail'd into France and conquer'd the Country, since that 
time call'd Normandy.  This is the sum of what pass'd in three years 
against the Danes, returning out of France, set down so perplexly by the 
Saxon Annalist, ill-gifted with utterance, as with much ado can be 
understood sometimes what is spoken, whether meant of the Danes, or of 
the Saxons.  After which troublesome time, Alfred enjoying three years 
of Peace, by him spent, as his manner was, not idly or voluptuously, but 
in all virtuous employments both of Mind and Body, becoming a Prince of 
his Renown, ended his days in the year 900, the 51st of his Age, the 
30th of his Reign, and was buried regally at Winchester;115. he was born 
at a place call'd Wanading in Berkshire,116. his Mother Osburga the 
Daughter of Oslac the King's Cup-bearer, a Goth by Nation, and of noble 
Descent.  He was of Person comelier then all his Brethren, of pleasing 
Tongue and graceful Behaviour, ready Wit and Memory; yet through the 
fondness of his Parents towards him, had not been taught to read till 
the twelfth year of his Age; but the great desire of Learning which was 
in him, soon appear'd by his conning of Saxon Poems day and night, which 
with great attention he heard by others repeated.  He was besides 
excellent at Hunting, and the new Art then of Hawking, but more 
exemplary in Devotion, having collected into a Book certain Prayers and 
Psalms, which he carried ever with him in his bosom to use on all 
occasions.  He thirsted after all liberal Knowledge, and oft complain'd 
that in his Youth he had no Teachers, in his middle Age so little 
vacancy from Wars and the cares of his Kingdom; yet leisure he found 
sometimes, not only to learn much himself, but to communicate therof 
what he could to his People, by translating Books out of Latin into 
English, Orosius, Boethius, Beda's History and others; permitted none 
unlearn'd to bear Office, either in Court or Commonwealth.  At twenty 
years of Age not yet reigning, he took to wife Egelswitha the Daughter 
of Ethelred a Mercian Earl.  The Extremities which befel him in the 
sixth of his Reign, Neothan Abbot told him, were justly come upon him 
for neglecting in his younger days the Complaint of such as injur'd and 
oppress'd repair'd to him, as then second Person in the Kingdom, for 
redress; which neglect were it such indeed, were yet excusable in a 
Youth, through jollity of mind unwilling perhaps to be detain'd long 
with sad and sorrowful Narrations; but from the tiime of his undertaking 
Regal charge, no man more patient in hearing causes, more inquisitive in 
examining, more exact in doing Justice, and providing good Laws, which 
are yet extant; more severe in punishing unjust Judges or obstinate 
Offenders.  Thieves especially and Robbers, to the terror of whom in 
cross ways were hung upon a high post certain Chains of Gold, as it were 
daring any one to take them thence; so that Justice seem'd in his days 
not to flourish only, but to triumph: no man then he more frugal of two 
pretious things in man's life, his Time and his Revenue; no man wiser in 
the disposal of both.  His time, the day, and night, he distributed by 
the burning of certain Tapers into three equal Portions; the one was for 
Devotion, the other for public or private Affairs, the third for bodily 
refreshment; how each hour past, he was put in mind by one who had that 
Office.  His whole annual Revenue, which his first care was should be 
justly his own, he divided into two equal parts; the first he employ'd 
to secular uses, and subdivided those into three, the first to pay his 
Soldiers, Houshold-Servants and Guard, of which divided into three 
Bands, one attended monthly by turn; the second was to pay his 
Architects and Workmen, whom he had got together of several Nations; for 
he was also an elegant Builder, above the Custom and Conceit of 
Englishmen in those days; the third he had in readiness to relieve or 
honour Strangers according to their worth, who came from all parts to 
see him, and to live under him.  The other equal part of his yearly 
Wealth he dedicated to religious uses, those of four sorts; the first to 
relieve the Poor, the second to the building and maintenance of two 
Monasteries, the third of a School, where he had persuaded the Sons of 
many Noblemen to study sacred Knowledge and Liberal Arts, some say at 
Oxford;117. the fourth was for the relief of foreign Churches, as far as 
India to the Shrine of St. Thomas, sending thither Siglem Bishop of 
Sherburn, who both return'd safe, and brought with him many rich Gems 
and Spices; Gifts also and a Letter he received from the Patriarch of 
Jerusalem; sent many to Rome, and from them receiv'd reliques.  Thus 
far, and much more might be said of his noble mind which render'd him 
the mirror of Princes; his Body was diseas'd in hisYouth with a great 
soreness in the Seige117a. , and that ceasing of it self, with another 
inward pain of unknown cause, which held him by frequent fits to his 
dying day: yet not disinabled to sustain those many glorious Labours of 
his Life both in Peace and War.

EDWARD  the Elder.

Edward the Son of Alfred succeeded, in Learning not equal,118. in Power 
and Extent of Dominion surpassing his Father.  The beginning of his 
Reign had much disturbance by Ethelwald an ambitious young Man,119. Son 
of the King's Uncle, or Cousin German, or Brother, for his Genealogy is 
variously deliver'd.  He vainly avouching to have equal right with 
Edward of Succession to the Crown,120. possess'd himself of Winburn in 
Dorset,121. and another Town diversly nam'd, giving out that there he 
would live or die; but encompass'd with the King's Forces at Badbury a 
place nigh, his Heart failing him, he stole out by night, and fled to 
the Danish Army beyond Humber.  The King sent after him, but not 
overtaking, found his Wife in the Town, whom he had married out of a 
Nunnery, and commanded her to be sent back thither.  About this time122. 
the Kentish Men, against a Multitude of Danish Pirates, fought 
prosperously at a place call'd Holme, as Hoveden records.  Ethelwald 
aided by the Northumbrians with Shipping, three years after,123. sailing 
to the East-Angles,124. persuaded the Danes there to fall into the 
King's Territory, who marching with him as far as Crecklad, and passing 
the Thames there, wasted as far beyond as they durst venture, and laden 
with Spoils return'd home.  The King with his Powers making speed after 
them, between the Dike and Ouse, suppos'd to be Suffolk and 
Cambridgeshire, as far as the Fenns Northward, laid waste all before 
him.  Thence intending to return, he commanded that all his Army should 
follow him close without delay; but the Kentish Men, though often call'd 
upon, lagging behind, the Danish Army prevented them, and join'd battel 
with the King: where Duke Sigulf and Earl Sigelm, with many other of the 
Nobles were slain; on the Danes part, Eoric their King, and Ethelwald 
the Author of this War, with others of high note, and of them greater 
number, but with great ruin on both sides; yet the Danes kept in their 
power the burying of their slain.  Whatever follow'd upon this Conflict, 
which we read not, the King two years after125. with the Danes, both of 
East-Angles and Northumberland, concluded Peace,126. which continu'd 
three Years, by whomsoever broken: for at the end therof King Edward 
raising great Forces out of West-Sex and Mercia,127. sent them against 
the Danes beyond Humber; where staying five weeks, they made great Spoil 
and Slaughter.128.  The King offer'd them terms of Peace, but they 
rejecting all, enter'd with the next year into Mercia,129. tendring no 
less Hostility then they had suffer'd;130. but at Tetnal in 
Staffordshire, saith Florent, were by the English in a set Battel 
overthrown.  King Edward then in Kent,  had got together of Ships about 
an hundred Sail, others gone Southward came back and met him.  The Danes 
now supposing that his main Forces were upon the Sea, took liberty to 
rove and plunder up and down, as hope of prey led them, beyond 
Severn.131.  The King guessing what might embolden them, sent before him 
the lightest of his Army to entertain them; then following with the 
rest, set upon them in their return over Cantbrig in Glocestershire, and 
slew many thousands, among whom Ecwils, Hafden, and Hinguar their Kings, 
and many other harsh Names in Huntingdon; the place also of this fight 
is variously written by Ethelwerd and Florent, call'd Wodensfield.  The 
year following132. Ethred Duke of Mercia, to whom Alfred had given 
London,133. with his Daughter in Marriage, now dying, King Edward 
resum'd that City, and Oxford, with the Countries adjoining, into his 
own hands; and the year after,134. built, or much repair'd by his 
Soldiers,135. the Town of Hertford on either side Lee; and leaving a 
sufficient number at the work, march'd about middle Summer, with the 
other part of his Forces into Essex, and encamp'd at Maldon, while his 
Soldiers built Witham; where a good part of the Country, subject 
formerly to the Danes, yielded themselves to his Protection.  Four years 
after136. (Florent allows but one year) the Danes from Leicester and 
Northampton, falling into Oxfordshire, committed much Rapine,137. and in 
some Towns therof great slaughter; while another party wasting 
Hertfordshire, met with other Fortune: for the Country-People inur'd now 
to such kind of Incursions, joining stoutly together, fell upon the 
Spoilers, and recover'd their own Goods, with some Booty from their 
Enemies.  About the same time Elfled the King's Sister sent her Army of 
Mercians into Wales,138. who routed the Welch, took the Castle of 
Bricnam-mere by Brecknock,139. and brought away the King's Wife of that 
Country with other Prisoners.  Not long after she took Derby from the 
Danes,  and the Castle by a sharp Assault.  But the year ensuing140. 
brought a new Fleet of Danes to Lidwic in Devonshire, under two Leaders, 
Otter and Roald;141. who sailing thence Westward about the Land's end, 
came up to the mouth of Severn; there landing wasted the Welch Coast, 
and Irchenfield part of Hertfordshire; where they took Kuneleac a 
British Bishop, for whose Ransom King Edward gave forty Pound: but the 
Men of Hereford and Glocestershire assembling, put them to flight; 
slaying Roald and the Brother of Otter, with many more, pursu'd them to 
a Wood, and there beset compell'd them to give Hostages of present 
departure.  The King with his Army sat not far off, securing from the 
South of Severn to Avon; so that openly they durst not, by night they 
twice ventur'd to land; but found such welcome, that few of them came 
back; the rest anchor'd by a small Island, where many of them famish'd; 
then sailing to a place call'd Deomed, they cross'd into Ireland.  The 
King with his Army went to Buckingham, staid there a month, and built 
two Castles or Forts on either Bank of Ouse ere his departing; and 
Turkitel a Danish Leader, with those of Bedford and Northampton, yielded 
him subjection.  Wherupon the next year142. he came with his Army to the 
Town of Bedford,143. took possession therof, staid there a month, and 
gave order to build another part of the Town, on the South-side of Ouse.  
Thence the year following144. went again to Maldon,145. repair'd and 
fortify'd the Town.  Turkitel the Dane having small hope to thrive here, 
where things with such prudence were managed against his Interest, got 
leave of the King, with as many Voluntaries as would follow him, to pass 
into France.  Early the next year146. King Edward re-edify'd 
Tovechester, now Torchester;147. and another City in the Annals call'd 
Wigingmere.  Mean while the Danes of Leicester and Northamptonshire, not 
liking perhaps to be neighbour'd with strong Towns, laid siege to 
Torchester; [but they within repelling the Assault one whole day till 
Supplies came] quitted the Siege by night; and pursued close by the 
Besieg'd, between Birnwud and Ailsbury were surpriz'd, many of them made 
prisoners, and much of their Baggage lost.  Other of the Danes at 
Huntingdon, aided from the East-Angles, finding that Castle not 
commodious, left it, and built another at Temsford, judging that place 
more opportune from whence to make their Excursions; and soon after went 
forth with design to assail Bedford: but the Garison issuing out, slew a 
great part of them, the rest fled.  After this a great Army of them 
gather'd out of Mercia and the East-Angles, came and besieg'd the City 
call'd Wigingmere a whole day; but finding it defended stoutly by them 
within, thence also departed, driving away much of their Cattel: 
wherupon the English from Towns and Cities round about joining Forces, 
laid siege to the Town and Castle of Temsford, and by assault took both; 
slew their King with Toglea a Duke, and Mannan his Son an Earl, with all 
the rest there found; who chose to die rather then yield.  Encourag'd by 
this, the Men of Kent, Surry, and part of Essex, enterprise the Siege of 
Colchester, nor gave over till they won it, sacking the Town and putting 
to Sword all the Danes therin, except some who escap'd over the Wall.  
To the succour of these, a great number of Danes inhabiting Ports and 
other Towns in the East-Angles, united their Force; but coming too late, 
as in revenge beleagured Maldon: but that Town also timely reliev'd, 
they departed, not only frustrate of their Design, but so hotly pursu'd, 
that many thousands of them lost their Lives in the flight.  Forthwith 
King Edward with his West-Saxons went to Passham upon Ouse, there to 
guard the Passage, while others were building a Stone Wall about 
Torchester; to him there Earl Thurfert, and other Lord Danes, with their 
Army therabout as far as Weolud, came and submitted.  Wherat the King's 
Soldiers joyfully cry'd out to be dismiss'd home: therfore with another 
part of them he enter'd Huntingdon, and repair'd it, where Breaches had 
been made; all the People therabout returning to Obedience.  The like 
was done at Colchester by the next remove of his Army; after which both 
East and West-Angles, and the Danish Forces among them, yielded to the 
King, swearing Allegiance to him both by Sea and Land: the Army also of 
Danes at Grantbrig, surrendring themselves, took the same Oath.  The 
Summer following148. he came with his Army to Stamford,149. built a 
Castle there on the South-side of the River, where all the People of 
these quarters acknowledg'd him Supreme.  During his abode there, Elfled 
his Sister, a martial Woman, who after her Husband's death would no more 
marry, but gave her self to public Affairs, repairing and fortifying 
many Towns, warring sometimes, died at Tamworth the chief Seat of 
Mercia, wherof by Gift of Alfred her Father, she was Lady or Queen; 
wherby that whole Nation became obedient to King Edward, as did also 
North-Wales, with Howel, Cledaucus, and Jeothwell, their Kings.  Thence 
passing to Nottingham, he enter'd and repair'd the Town, plac'd there 
part English, part Danes, and receiv'd Fealty from all in Mercia of 
either Nation.  The next Autumn,150. coming with his Army into Cheshire 
he built and fortify'd Thelwel;151. and while he staid there, call'd 
another Army out of Mercia, which he sent to repair and fortify 
Manchester.  About Midsummer following152. he march'd again to 
Nottingham,153. built a Town over against it on the South-side of that 
River, and with a Bridge join'd them both; thence journey'd to a place 
call'd Bedecanwillan in Pictland; there also built and fenc'd a City on 
the Borders, where the King of Scots did him honour as to his Sovereign, 
together with the whole Scotish Nation; the like did Reginald and the 
Son of Eadulf, Danish Princes, with all the Northumbrians, both English 
and Danes.  The King also of a People therabout call'd Streatgledwalli, 
(the North-Welch, as Camden thinks, of Strat-Cluid in Denbighshire, 
perhaps rather the British of Cumberland ) did him homage, and not 
undeserv'd.  For Buchanan himself confesses,154. that this King Edward, 
with a small number of Men compar'd to his Enemies, overthrew in a great 
Battel the whole united Power both of Scots and Danes, slew most of the 
Scotish Nobility, and forc'd Malcolm, whom Constantine the Scotch King 
had made General, and design'd Heir of his Crown, to save himself by 
flight sore wounded.  Of the English he makes Athelstan the Son of 
Edward chief Leader; and so far seems to confound Times and Actions, as 
to make this Battel the same with that fought by Athelstan about 24 
years after at Bruneford, against Anlaf and Constantine, wherof 
hereafter.  But here Buchanan takes occasion to inveigh against the 
English Writers,155. upbraiding them with Ignorance, who affirm 
Athelstan to have been supreme King of Britain, Constantine the Scotish 
King with others to have held of him: and denies that in the Annals of 
Marianus Scotus, any mention is to be found therof; which I shall not 
stand much to contradict, for in Marianus, whether by Surname or by 
Nation Scotus, will be found as little mention of any other Scotish  
Affairs, till the time of King Dunchad slain by Machetad, or Mackbeth, 
in the year 1040: which gives cause of suspicion, that the Affairs of 
Scotland before that time were so obscure as to be unknown to their own 
Countryman, who liv'd and wrote his Chronicle not long after.  But King 
Edward thus nobly doing, and thus honour'd, the year following died at 
Farendon;156. a Builder and Restorer even in War,157. not a Destroyer of 
his Land.158.  He had by several Wives many Children;159. his eldest 
Daughter Edgith he gave in marriage to Charles King of France, 
Grandchild of Charles the Bald above-mention'd; of the rest in place 
convenient.  His Laws are yet to be seen.  He was buried at Winchester, 
in the Monastery by Alfred his Father.  And a few days after him died 
Ethelwerd his eldest Son, the Heir of his Crown.  He had the whole 
Island in subjection, yet so as petty Kings reign'd under him.160.  In 
Northumberland, after Ecbert whom the Danes had set up, and the 
Northumbrians yet unruly under their Yoke, at the end of six years had 
expell'd, one Ricsig was set up King, and bore the name three years; 
then another Ecbert, and Guthred; the latter, if we believe Legends, of 
a Servant made King by command of St. Cudbert, in a Vision; and enjoin'd 
by another Vision of the same Saint, to pay well for his Royalty many 
Lands and Privileges to his Church and Monastery.  But now to the Story.

ATHELSTAN.

Athelstan, next in age to Ethelward his Brother, who deceas'd untimely 
few days before, though born of a Concubine, yet for the great 
appearance of many Virtues in him, and his Brethren being yet under Age, 
was exalted to the Throne at Kingston upon Thames,161. and by his 
Father's last Will saith Malmsbury, yet not without some opposition of 
one Alfred and his Accomplices; who not liking he should reign, had 
conspir'd to seize on him after his Father's death, and to put out his 
Eyes.  But the Conspirators discover'd, and Alfred denying the Plot, was 
sent to Rome,162. to assert his Innocence before the Pope; where taking 
his Oath on the Altar, he fell down immediately, and carry'd out by his 
Servants, three days after died.  Mean while beyond Humber the Danes, 
though much aw'd, were not idle.  Inguald, one of their Kings, took 
possession of York;163. Sitric, who some years before had slain Niel his 
Brother, by force took Davenport in Cheshire; and however he defended 
these doings, grew so inconsiderable,164. that Athelstan with great 
Solemnity gave him his Sister Edgith to wife:165. but he enjoy'd her not 
long, dying ere the year's end,166. nor his Sons Anlaf and Guthfert the 
Kingdom, driven out the next year by Athelstan; not unjustly saith 
Huntingdon, as being first Raisers of the War.167.  Simeon calls him 
Gudfrid a British King, whom Athelstan this year drove out of his 
Kingdom; and perhaps they were both one, the name and time not much 
differing, the place only mistaken.  Malmsbury differs in the name also, 
calling him Aldulf a certain Rebel.  Them also I wish as much mistaken, 
who write that Athelstan, jealous of his younger Brother Edwin's 
towardly Virtues, lest added to the right of Birth, they might some time 
or other call in question his illegitimate Precedence, caus'd him to be 
drown'd in the Sea;168. expos'd, some say, with one Servant in a rotten 
Bark, without Sail or Oar; where the Youth far off Land, and in rough 
Weather despairing, threw himself over-board;169. the Servant more 
patient, got to Land and reported the Success.  But this Malmsbury 
confesses to be sung in old Songs, not read in warrantable Authors: and 
Huntingdon speaks as of a sad Accident to Athelstan, that he lost his 
Brother Edwin by Sea; far the more credible, in that Athelstan, as it is 
written by all, tenderly lov'd and bred up the rest of his Brethren, of 
whom he had no less cause to be jealous.  And the year following170. he 
prosper'd better then from so foul a Fact,171. passing into Scotland 
with great Puissance, both by Sea and Land,172. and chacing his Enemies 
before him, by Land as far as Dunfeoder and Wertermore, by Sea as far as 
Cathness.  The cause of this Expedition, saith Malmsbury, was to demand 
Guthfert the Son of Sitric, thither fled, though not deny'd at length by 
Constantine, who with Eugenius King of Cumberland, at a place call'd 
Dacor or Dacre in that Shire, surrender'd himself and each his Kingdom 
to Athelstan, who brought back with him for Hostage the Son of 
Constantine.173.  But Guthfert escaping in the mean while out of 
Scotland, and Constantine exasperated by this Invasion,174. persuaded 
Anlaf the other Son of Sitric then fled into Ireland,175. others write 
Anlaf King of Ireland and the Isles, his Son-in-law,176. with 615 Ships, 
and the King of Cumberland with other Forces,177. to his aid.  This 
within four years effected, they enter'd England by Humber,178. and 
fought with Athelstan at a place call'd Wendune, others term it 
Brunanburg, others Bruneford, which Ingulf places beyond Humber, Camden 
in Glendale of Northumberland on the Scotch Borders; the bloodiest 
Fight, say Authors, that ever this Island saw: to describe which the 
Saxon Annalist wont to be sober and succinct, whether the same or 
another Writer, now labouring under the weight of his Argument, and 
over-charg'd, runs on a sudden into such extravagant Fancies and 
Metaphors, as bare him quite beside the Scope of being understood.  
Huntingdon, though himself peccant enough in this kind, transcribes him 
word for word as a Pastime to his Readers.  I shall only sum up what of 
him I can attain, in usual Language.  The Battel was fought eagerly from 
Morning till Night; some fell of King Edward's old Army, try'd in many a 
Battel before; but on the other side great multitudes, the rest fled to 
their Ships.  Five Kings, and seven of Anlaf's chief Captains, were 
slain on the place, with Froda, a Norman Leader; Constantine escap'd 
home, but lost his Son in the Fight, if I understand my Author; Anlaf by 
Sea to Dublin, with a small Remainder of his great Hoast.  Malmsbury 
relates this War, adding many Circumstances after this manner: That 
Anlaf joining with Constantine and the whole Power of Scotland, besides 
those which he brought with him out of Ireland, came on far Southwards, 
till Athelstan who had retir'd on set purpose to be the surer of his 
Enemies, enclos'd from all Succour and Retreat, met him at Bruneford.  
Anlaf perceiving the Valour and Resolution of Athelstan, and mistrusting 
his own Forces, though numerous, resolv'd first to spy in what posture 
his Enemies lay: and imitating perhaps what he heard attempted by King 
Alfred the Age before, in the habit of a Musician, got access by his 
Lute and Voice to the King's Tent, there playing both the Minstrel and 
the Spy: then towards Evening dismiss'd, he was observ'd by one who had 
been his Soldier, and well knew him, viewing earnestly the King's Tent, 
and what Approaches lay about it, then in the Twilight to depart.  The 
Soldier forthwith acquaints the King, and by him blam'd for letting go 
his Enemy, answer'd, that he had given first his military Oath to Anlaf, 
whom if he had betray'd, the King might suspect him of like treasonous 
Mind towards himself; which to disprove, he advis'd him to remove his 
Tent a good distance off; and so done, it happen'd that a Bishop with 
his Retinue coming that Night to the Army, pitch'dhis Tent in the same 
place from whence the King had remov'd.  Anlaf coming by night as he had 
design'd, to assault the Camp, and especially the King's Tent, finding 
there the Bishop in stead, slew him with all his Followers.  Athelstan 
took the Alarm, and as it seems, was not found so unprovided, but that 
the day now appearing, he put his Men in order, and maintain'd the Fight 
till Evening; wherin Constantine himself was slain with five other 
Kings, and twelve Earls, the Annals were content with seven, in the rest 
not disagreeing.  Ingulf Abbot of Croyland, from the Authority of 
Turketul a principal Leader in this Battel, relates it more at large to 
this effect: That Athelstan above a Mile distant from the place where 
Execution was done upon the Bishop and his Supplies, alarm'd at the 
noise, came down by break of day upon Anlaf and his Army, overwatch'd 
and wearied now with the Slaughter they had made, and something out of 
order, yet in two main Battels.  The King therfore in like manner 
dividing, led the one part consisting most of West-Saxons, against Anlaf 
with his Danes and Irish, committing the other to his Chancellor 
Turketul, with the Mercians and Londoners, against Constantine and his 
Scots.  The shower of Arrows and Darts over-pass'd, both Battels 
attack'd each other with a close and terrible Ingagement, for a long 
space neither side giving ground.  Till the Chancellor Turketul, a Man 
of great Stature and Strength, taking with him a few Londoners of select 
Valour, and Singin who led the Worcestershire Men, a Captain of 
undaunted Courage, broke into the thickest, making his way first through 
the Picts and Orkeners, then through the Cumbriuns and Scots, and came 
at length where Constantine himself fought, unhors'd him, and us'd all 
means to take him alive; but the Scots valiantly defending their King, 
and laying load upon Turketul, which the Goodness of his Armour well 
endur'd, he had yet been beaten down, had not Singin his faithful Second 
at the same time slain Constantine; which once known, Anlaf and the 
whole Army betook them to flight, wherof a huge multitude fell by the 
Sword.  This Turketul not long after leaving worldly Affairs, became 
Abbot of Croyland, which at his own cost he had repair'd from Danish 
Ruins, and left there this Memorial of his former Actions.  Athelstan 
with his Brother Edmund wictorious, thence turning into Wales, with much 
more ease vanquish'd Ludwal the King, and possess'd his Land.  But 
Malmsbury writes, that commiserating human chance, as he displac'd, so 
he restor'd both him and Constantine to their Regal State; for the 
Surrender of King Constantine hath been above spoken of.  However the 
Welch did him homage at the City of Hereford, and covenanted yearly 
payment of Gold 20 pound, of Silver 300, of Oxen 25 thousand, besides 
hunting Dogs and Hawks.  He also took Exeter from the Cornish Britains, 
who till that time had equal Right there with the English, and bounded 
them with the River Tamar, as the other British with Wey.  Thus dreaded 
of his Enemies, and renown'd far and near, three years after179. he died 
at Glocester, and was buried with many Trophies at Malmsbury,180. where 
he had caus'd to be laid his two Cousin Germans,181. Elwin and 
Ethelstan, both slain in the Battel against Anlaf.182.   He was 30 years 
old at his coming to the Crown, mature in Wisdom from his Childhood, 
comely of person and behaviour; so that Alfred his Grandfather in 
blessing him was wont to pray he might live to have the Kingdom, and put 
him yet a Child into Soldiers Habit.  He had his breeding in the Court 
of Elfled his Aunt, of whose virtues more then female we have related, 
sufficient to evince that his Mother, though said to be no wedded Wife, 
was yet such of parentage and worth, as the Royal Line disdain'd not, 
though the Son went in Malmsbury's days (for it seems he refus'd not the 
authority of Ballads for want of better) that his Mother a Farmer's 
Daughter, but of excellent Feature; who dreamt one night she brought 
forth a Moon that should enlighten the whole Land: which the King's 
Nurse hearing of, took her home and bred up courtly; that the King 
coming one day to visit his Nurse, saw there this Damsel, lik'd her, and 
by earnest Suit prevailing, had by her this famous Athelstan, a 
bounteous, just and affable King, as Malmsbury sets him forth; nor less 
honour'd abroad by foreign Kings who sought his Friendship by great 
Gifts or Affinity; that Harold King of Noricum, sent him a Ship whose 
Prow was of gold, Sails purple, and other Golden things the more to be 
wonder'd at, sent from Noricum, whether meant Norway or Bavaria, the one 
place so far from such superfluity of Wealth, the other from all Sea: 
the Embassadors were Helgrim and Offrid, who found the King at York.  
His Sisters he gave in marriage to greatest Princes, Elgif to Otho Son 
of Henry the Emperor, Egdith to a certain Duke about the Alps, Edgiv to 
Lufwic King of Aquitain, sprung of Charles the Great, Ethilda to Hugo 
King of France, who sent Aldulf Son of Baldwin Earl of Flanders to obain 
her.  From all these great Suitors, especially from the Emperor and King 
of France, came rich Presents, Horses of excellent breed, gorgeous 
Trappings and Armour, Reliques, Jewels, Odors, Vessels of Onyx, and 
other precious things, which I leave poetically describ'd in Malmsbury, 
taken, as he confesses, out of an old Versifier, some of whose Verses he 
recites.  The only blemish left upon him, was the exposing his Brother 
Edwin, who disavow'd by Oath the Treason wherof he was accus'd, and 
implor'd an equal hearing.  But these were Songs, as before hath been 
said, which add also that Athelstan, his anger over, soon repented of 
the Fact, and put to death his Cup-bearer, who had induc'd him to 
suspect and expose his Brother, put in mind by a word falling from the 
Cup-bearer's own mouth, who slipping one day as he bore the King's Cup, 
and recovering himself on the other Leg, said aloud fatally, as to him 
it prov'd, one Brother helps the other.  Which words the King laying to 
heart, and pondering how ill he had done to make away his Brother, 
aveng'd himself first on the adviser of that Fact, took on him seven 
years Penance, and as Mat. West. saith, built two Monasteries for the 
Soul of his Brother.  His Laws are extant among the Laws of other Saxon 
Kings to this day.

EDMUND.

Edmund not above 18 years old183. succeeded his Brother Athelstan, in 
Courage not inferior.184.  For in the second of his Reign he freed 
Mercia of the Danes that remain'd there, and took from them the Cities 
of Lincoln, Nottingham, Stamford, Derby, and Leicester, where they were 
plac'd by King Edward, but it seems gave not good proof of their 
Fidelity.  Simeon writes that Anlaf setting forth from York, and having 
wasted Southward as far as Northampton, was met by Edmund at Leicester; 
but that ere the Battels join'd, Peace was made between them by Odo and 
Wulstan the two Archbishops, with Conversion of Anlaf; for the same year 
Edmund received at the Font-stone this or another Anlaf, as saith 
Huntingdon, not him spoken of before, who died this year (so uncertain 
they are in the story of these times also) and held Reginald another 
King of the Northumbers, while the Bishop confirm'd him; their Limits 
were divided North and South by Watling-street.  But spiritual Kindred 
little avail'd to keep peace between them, whoever gave the cause; for 
we read him two years after driving Anlaf (whom the Annals now first 
call the Son of Sitric ) and Suthfrid Son of Reginald out of 
Northumberland,185. taking the whole Country into subjection.186.  
Edmund the next year187. harass'd Cumberland, then gave it to Malcolm 
King of Scots, therby bound to assist him in his Wars, both by Sea and 
Land;188. Mat. West. adds, that in this action Edmund had the aid of 
Leolin Prince of North-Wales, against Dummail the Cumbrian King, him 
depriving of his Kingdom, and his two Sons of their Sight.  But the year 
after189. he himself by strange accident came to an untimely Death:189. 
Feasting with his Nobles on St. Austin's Day at Puclekerke in 
Glocestershire, to celebrate the memory of his first converting the 
Saxons; he spied Leof a noted Thief, whom he had banish'd, sitting among 
his Guests: wherat transported with too much vehemence of spirit, though 
in a just cause, rising from the Table he run upon the Thief, and 
catching his Hair, pull'd him to the ground.  The Thief who doubted from 
such handling no less then his Death intended, thought to die not 
ureveng'd; and with a short Dagger struck the King, who still laid at 
him, and little expected such Assassination, mortally into the Breast.  
The matter was done in a moment, ere men sat at Table could turn them, 
or imagine at first what the stir meant, till perceiving the King deadly 
wounded, they flew upon the Murderer and hew'd him to pieces; who like a 
wild Beast at abay, seeing himself surrounded, desperately laid about 
him, wounding some in his fall,  The King was buried at Glaston, wherof 
Dunstan was then Abbot; his Laws yet remain to be seen among the Laws of 
other Saxon Kings.

EDRED.

Edred the third Brother of Athelstan, the son of Edmund being yet but 
Children, next reign'd, not degenerating from his worthy Predecessors, 
and crown'd at Kingston.  Northumberland he throughly subdu'd, the Scots 
without refusal swore him Allegiance; yet the Northumbrians, ever of 
doubtful Faith, soon after chose to themselves one Eric a Dane.  
Huntingdon still haunts us with this Anlaf (of whom we gladly would have 
been rid) and will have him before Eric recall'd once more and reign 
four years,190. then again put to his shifts.191.  But Edred entring 
into Northumberland, and with Spoils returning, Eric the King fell upon 
his Rear.  Edred turning about, both shook off the Enemy, and prepar'd 
to make a second Inroad: which the Northumbrians dreading rejected Eric, 
slew Amancus the Son of Anlaf, 192. and with many presents appeasing 
Edred, submitted again to his Government; nor from that time had Kings, 
but were govern'd by Earls, of whom Osulf was the first.  About this 
time193. Wulstan Archbishop of York, accus'd to have slain certain men 
of Thetford in revenge of their Abbot whom the Townsmen had slain,194. 
was committed by the King to close Custody; but soon after enlarg'd, was 
restor'd to his place.  Malmsbury writes, that his Crime was to have 
conniv'd at the revolt of his Countrymen: but King Edred two years 
after195.  sickning in the flower of his Youth, died much lamented, and 
was buried at Winchester.196. 

EDWI.

Edwi the Son of Edmund now come to Age,197. after his Uncle Edred's 
death took on him the Government, and was crown'd at Kingston.  His 
lovely Person surnam'd the Fair, his actions are diversly reported, by 
Huntingdon not thought illaudable.  But Malmsbury and such as follow him 
write far otherwise, that he married, or kept as Concubine,198. his near 
Kinswoman, some say both her and her Daughter; so inordinately given to 
his pleasure, that on the very day of his Coronation, he abruptly 
withdrew himself from the Company of his Peers, whether in Banquet or 
Consultation, to sit wantoning in the Chamber with his Algiva, so was 
her name, who had such power over him.  Wherat his Barons offended, sent 
Bishop Dunstan, the boldest among them, to request his return: he going 
to the Chamber, not only interrupted his dalliance, and rebuk'd the 
Lady, but taking him by the hand, between force and persuasion brought 
him back to his Nobles.  the King highly displeas'd, and instigated 
perhaps by her who was so prevalent with him, not long after sent 
Dunstan into Banishment,199. caus'd his Monastery to be rifled, and 
became an Enemy to all Monks and Fryers.  Wherupon Odo Archbishop of 
Canterbury pronounc'd a separation or Divorce of the King from Algiva.  
But that which most incited William of Malmsbury against him, he gave 
that Monastery to be dwelt in by secular Priests, or, to use his own 
Phrase, made it a stable of Clerks; at length these Affronts done to the 
Church were so resented by the People, that the Mercians and 
Northumbrians revolted from him, and set up Edgar his Brother,200. 
leaving to Edwi the West-Saxons only, bounded by the River Thames;201. 
with Grief wherof, as is thought,202. he soon after ended his days,203. 
and was buried at Winchester.204.  Mean while Elfsin Bishop of that 
place after the Death of Odo, ascending by Simony to the Chair of 
Canterbury, and going to Rome the same year for his Pall, was frozen to 
death in the Alps.

EDGAR.

Edgar by his Brother's Death,205. now King of all England at 16 years of 
Age, call'd home Dunstan out of Flanders, where he liv'd in Exile.206. 
This King had no War all his Reign; yet always well prepar'd for War, 
govern'd the Kingdom in great Peace, Honour and Prosperity, gaining 
thence the Surname of Peaceable, much extoll'd for Justice, Clemency, 
and all Kingly Virtues, the more ye may be sure, by Monks, for his 
building so many Monasteries;207. as some write, every year one: for he 
much favour'd the Monks against secular Priests, who in the time of Edwi 
had got possession in most of their Convents.  His care and wisdom was 
great in guarding the Coast round with stout Ships to the number of 
3600, Mat. West. reckons them 4800, divided into four Squadrons, to sail 
to and fro about the four quarters of the Land, meeting each other; the 
first of 1200 sail from East to West, the second of as many from West to 
East, the third and fourth between North and South; himself in the 
Summer time with his Fleet.  Thus he kept out wisely the force of 
Strangers, and prevented foreign War; but by their too frequent resort 
hither in time of Peace, and his too much favouring them, he let in 
their Vices unaware.  Thence the People, saith Malmsbury, learnt of the 
outlandish Saxons rudeness, of the Flemish daintiness and softness; of 
the Danes Drunkenness; though I doubt these Vices are as naturally 
homebred here as in any of those Countries.  Yet in the Winter and 
Spring time he usually rode the Circuit as a Judge Itinerant through all 
his Provinces, to see Justice well administer'd, and the Poor not 
oppress'd.  Thieves and Robbers he rooted almost out of the Land, and 
wild Beasts of prey altogether; enjoining Ludwal King of Wales to pay 
the yearly Tribute of 300 Wolves, which he did for two years together, 
till the third year no more were to be found, nor ever after; but his 
Laws may be read yet extant.  Whatever was the cause, he was not crown'd 
till the 30th of his Age, but then with great splendor and magnificence 
at the City of Bath, in the Feast of Pentecost.  This year208. died 
Swarling a Monk of Croyland, in the 142d of his Age,209. and another 
soon after him in the 115th in that fenny and watrish Air, the more 
remarkable.210.  King Edgar the next year211. went to Chester,212. and 
summoning to his Court there all the Kings that held of him took Homage 
of them: their names are Kened King of Scots, Malcolm of Cumberland, 
Maccuse of the Isles, five of Wales, Duswal, Huwal, Crifith, Jacob, 
Judethil; these he had in such awe, that going one day into a Galley, he 
caus'd them to take each man his Oar, and row him down the River Dee, 
while he himself sat at the Stern; which might be done in merriment, and 
easily obey'd; of with a serious brow, discover'd rather vain-glory, and 
insulting haughtiness, then moderation of Mind.  And that he did it 
seriously triumphing, appears by his words then utter'd, that his 
Successors might then glory to be Kings of England, when they had such 
honur done them.  And perhaps the Divine Power was displeas'd with him 
for taking too much honour to himself; since we read that the year 
following213. he was taken out of this Life by Sickness in the height of 
his Glory and the prime of his Age, buried at Glaston Abby.  The same 
year, as Matt. West. relates, he gave to Kened the Scotish King, many 
rich Presents, and the whole Country of Laudian, or Lothien, to hold of 
him on condition that he and his Successors should repair to the English 
Court at high Festivals when the King sat crown'd; gave him also many 
lodging Places by the way, which till the days of Henry the second, were 
still held by the Kings of Scotland.  He was of Stature not tall, of 
Body slender, yet so well made, that in strength he chose to contend 
with such as were thought strongest, and dislik'd nothing more then that 
they should spare him for respect or fear to hurt him.  Kened King of 
Scots then in the Court of Edgar, sitting one day at Table, was heard to 
say jestingly among his Servants, he wonder'd how so many Provinces 
could be held in subjection by such a little dapper man: his words were 
brought to the King's ear; he sends for Kened as about some private 
business, and in talk drawing him forth to a secret place, takes from 
under his Garment two Swords which he had brought with him, gave one of 
them to Kened; and now saith he, it shall be try'd which ought to be the 
subject; for it is shameful for a King to boast at Table, and shrink in 
Fight.  Kened much abash'd fell presently at his feet, and besought him 
to pardon what he had simply spoken, no way intended to his dishonour or 
disparagment; wherwith the King was satisfy'd.  Camden in his 
description of Ireland, cites a Charter of King Edgar, wherin it appears 
he had in subjection all the Kingdoms of the Isles as far as Norway, and 
had subdu'd the greatest part of Ireland with the City of Dublin: but of 
this, other Writers make no mention.  In his youth having heard of 
Elfrida, Daughter of Ordgar Duke of Devonshire, much commended for her 
Beauty, he sent Earl Athelwold, whose Loyalty he trusted most, to see 
her; intending, if she were found such as answer'd report, to demand her 
in marriage.  He at the first view taken with her presence, disloyally, 
as it oft happens in such Employments, began to sue for himself; and 
with consent of her Parents obtain'd her.  Returning therfore with 
scarce an ordinary commendation of her Feature, he easily took off the 
King's mind, soon diverted another way.  But the matter coming to light 
how Athelwold had forestall'd the King, and Elfrida's Beauty more and 
more spoken of, the King now heated not only with a relapse of Love, but 
with a deep sense of the abuse, yet dissembling his disturbance, 
pleasantly told the Earl, what day he meant to come and visit him and 
his fair Wife.  The Earl seemingly assur'd his welcome, but in the  mean 
while acquainting his Wife, earnestly advis'd her to deform her self 
what she might, either in dress or otherwise, lest the King whose 
amorous Inclination was not unknown, should chance to be attracted.  She 
who by this time was not ignorant, how Athelwold had step'd between her 
and the King, against his coming arrays her self richly, using whatever 
art she could devise might render her the more amiable; and it took 
effect.  For the King inflam'd with her Love the more for that he had 
been so long defrauded and robb'd of her, resolv'd not only to recover 
his intercepted right, but to punish the interloper of his destin'd 
Spouse; and appointing with him as was usual, a day of Hunting, drawn 
aside in the Forest, now call'd Harewood, smote him through with a Dart.  
Some censure this act as cruel and tyrannical, but consider'd well, it 
may be judg'd more favourably, and that no man of sensible Spirit but in 
his place, without extraordinary perfection, would have done the like: 
for next to Life what worse Treason could have been committed against 
him?  It chanc'd that the Earl's base Son coming by upon the Fact, the 
King sternly ask'd him how he lik'd this Game; he submissly answering, 
that whatsoever pleas'd the King, must not displease him; the King 
return'd to his wonted temper, took an affection to the Youth, and ever 
after highly favour'd him, making amends in the Son for what he had done 
to the Father.  Elfrida forthwith he took to Wife, who to expiate her 
former Husband's death, tho' therin she had no hand, cover'd the place 
of his Bloodshed with a Monastery of Nuns to sing over him.  Another 
fault is laid to his charge, no way excusable, that he took a Virgin 
Wilfrida by force out of the Nunnery, where she was plac'd by her 
Friends to avoid his pursuit, and kept her as his Concubine; but liv'd 
not obstinately in the Offence; for sharply reprov'd by Dunstan, he 
submitted to seven years Penance, and for that time to want his 
Coronation: but why he had it not before, is left unwritten.  Another 
Story there goes of Edgar, fitter for a Novel then a History; but as I 
find it in Malmsbury, so I relate it.  While he was yet unmarried, in 
his youth he abstain'd not from Women, and coming on a day to Andover, 
caus'd a Duke's Daughter there dwelling, reported rare of Beauty, to be 
brought to him.  The Mother not daring flatly to deny, yet abhorring 
that her Daughter should be so deflour'd, at fit time of Night sent in 
her Attire, one of her waiting Maids: a Maid it seems not unhandsome nor 
unwitty; who supply'd the place of her young Lady.  Night pass'd, the 
Maid going to rise, but Daylight scarce yet appearing, was by the King 
ask'd why she made such haste; she answer'd, to do the work which her 
Lady had set her; at which the King wondring, and with much ado staying 
her to unfold the Riddle, for he took her to be the Duke's Daugher, she 
falling at his feet besought him, that since at the command of her Lady 
she came to his Bed, and was enjoy'd by him, he would be pleas'd in 
recompence to set her free from the hard service of her Mistress.  The 
King a while standing in a study whether he had best be angry or not, at 
length turning all to a Jest, took the Maid away with him, advanc'd her 
above her Lady, lov'd her, and accompanied with her only, till he 
married Elfrida.  These only are his faults upon record, rather to be 
wonder'd how they were so few, and so soon left, he coming at 16 to the 
Licence of a Scepter; and that his Virtues were so many and so mature, 
he dying before the Age wherin wisdom can in others attain to any 
ripeness: however, with him died all the Saxon Glory.  From henceforth 
nothing is to be heard of but their decline and ruin under a double 
Conquest, and the Causes foregoing; which not to blur or taint the 
praises of their former actions and liberty well defended, shall stand 
severally related, and will be more then long enough for another Book.

EDWARD the Younger.

Edward the eldest Son of Edgar by Egelfleda his first Wife, the Daughter 
of Duke Ordmer, was according to Right and his Father's Will plac'd in 
the Throne; Elfrida his second Wife, and her Faction only repining, who 
labour'd to have had her Son Ethelred a Child of seven years, prefer'd 
before her; that she under that pretence might have rul'd all.  Mean 
while Comets were seen in Heaven, portending not Famine only, which 
follow'd the next year, but the troubl'd State of the whole Realm not 
long after to ensue.  The Troubles begun in Edwi's days, between Monks 
and Secular Pirests, now reviv'd and drew on either side many of the 
Nobles into Parties.  For Elfere Duke of the Mercians, with many other 
Peers, corrupted as is said with Gifts,1. drove the Monks out of those 
Monasteries where Edgar had plac'd them, and in their stead put Secular 
Priests with their Wives.2.  But Ethelwin Duke of East-Angles, with his 
Brother Elfwold, and Earl Britnoth oppos'd them, and gathering an Army 
defended the Abbeys of East-Angles from such Intruders.  To appease 
these Tumults, a Synod was call'd at Winchester; and nothing there 
concluded, a general Council both of Nobles and Prelates was held at 
Caln in Wiltshire, where while the dispute was hot, but chiefly against 
Dunstan, the room wherin they sat fell upon their heads, killing some, 
maiming others, Dunstan only escaping upon a Beam that fell not, and the 
King absent by reason of his tender Age.  This Accident quieted the 
controversy, and brought both parts to hold with Dunstan and the Monks.  
Mean while the King addicted to a Religious Life, and of a mild Spirit, 
simply permitted all things to the ambitious Will of his Step-mother and 
her Son Ethelred: to whom she, displeas'd that the name only of King was 
wanting, practis'd thenceforth to remove King Edward out of the way; 
which in this manner she brought about.  Edward on a day wearied with 
hunting, thirsty and alone, while his Attendants follow'd the Dogs, 
hearing that Ethelred and his Mother lodg'd at Corvesgate; (Corse 
Castle, saith Camden, in the Isle of Purbeck) innocently went thither.  
She with all shew of kindness welcoming him, commended Drink to be 
brought forth, for it seems he lighted not from his Horse; and while he 
was drinking, caus'd one of her Servants, privately before instructed, 
to stab him with a Poniard.  The poor Youth, who little expected such 
unkindness there, turning speedily the Reins, fled bleeding; till 
through Loss of Blood falling from his Horse, and expiring, yet held 
with one foot in the Stirrup, he was dragg'd along the way, trac'd by 
his Blood, and buried without Honour at Werham, having reign'd about 
three years: but the place of his Burial not long after grew famous for 
Miracles.  After which3. by Duke Elfere (who, as Malmsbury saith, had a 
hand in his Death)4. he was royally inter'd at Skepton or Shaftsbury.  
The murdress Elfrida at length repenting, spent the residue of her days 
in Sorrow and great Penance.

ETHELRED.

Ethelred second Son of Edgar by Elfrida5. (for Edmund died a Child) his 
Brother Edward wickedly remov'd,6. was now next in right to succeed, and 
accordingly crown'd at Kingston: reported by some, fair of Visage, 
comely of Person, elegant of Behaviour;7. but the Event will shew that 
with many sluggish and ignoble Vices he quickly shamed his out-side;8. 
born and prolong'd a fatal mischief of the People, and the ruin of his 
Country; wherof he gave early signs from his first Infancy, bewraying 
the Font and Water while the Bishop was baptizing him.  Wherat Dunstan 
much troubl'd, for he stood by and saw it, to them next him broke into 
these words, By God and God's Mother, this Boy will prove a Sluggard.  
Another thing is written of him in his Childhood; which argu'd no bad 
nature, that hearing of his Brother Edward's cruel Death, he made loud 
lamentation; but his furious Mother offended therwith, and having no Rod 
at hand, beat him so with great Wax-Candles, that he hated the sight of 
them ever after.  Dunstan though unwilling set the Crown upon his head; 
but at the same time foretold openly, as is reported, that great Evils 
that were to come upon him and the Land, in avengement of his Brother's 
innocent Blood.9.  And about the same time,10. one midnight, a Cloud 
sometimes bloody, sometimes fiery, was seen over all England;11. and 
within three years the Danish Tempest, which had long surceast, revolv'd 
again upon this Island.  To the more ample relating wherof, the Danish 
History, at least their latest and diligentest Historian, as neither 
from the first landing of Danes, in the Reign of West-Saxon Brithric, so 
now again from first to last, contributes nothing; busied more then 
enough to make out the bare Names and Successions of their uncertain 
Kings, and their small Actions at home: unless out of him I should 
transcribe what he takes, and I better may, from our own Annals; the 
surer and the sadder witnesses of their doings here, not glorious, as 
they vainly boast, but most inhumanly barbarous.  For the Danes well 
understanding, that England had now a slothful King to their wish,12. 
first landing at Southampton from seven great Ships, took the Town, 
spoil'd the Country, and carried away with them great Pillage;13. nor 
was Devonshire and Cornwall uninfested on the shore;14. Pyrates of 
Norway also harried the Coast of West-chester:15. and to add a worse 
Calamity, the City of London was burnt, casually or not, is not 
written.16.  It chanc'd four years after,17. that Ethelred besieg'd 
Rochester, some way or other offended by the Bishop therof.18.  Dunstan 
not approving the Cause,19. sent to warn him that he provoke not St. 
Andrew the Patron of that City, nor waste his Lands; an old craft of the 
Clergy to secure their Church-Lands, by entailing them on some Saint; 
the King not hearkening, Dunstan on this condition that the Siege might 
be rais'd, sent him an hundred Pounds, the Money was accepted and the 
Siege dissolv'd.  Dunstan reprehending his Avarice, sent him again this 
word, Because thou hast respected Money more then Religion, the Evils 
which I foretold shall the sooner come upon thee; but not in my days, 
for so God hath spoken.  The next year was calamitious,20. bringing 
strange Fluxes upon Men, and Murrain upon Cattle.21.  Dunstan the year 
following died,22. a strenuous Bishop, zealous without dread of Person, 
and for aught appears, the best of many Ages, if he busied not himself 
too much in Secular Affairs.23.  He was Chaplain at first to King 
Athelstan, and Edmund who succeeded, much employ'd in Court-Affairs, 
till envy'd by some who laid many things to his charge, he was by Edmund 
forbidden the Court; but by the earnest Mediation, saith Ingulf, of 
Turketul the Chancellor, receiv'd at length to favour, and made Abbot of 
Glaston; lastly by Edgar and the general Vote, Archbishop of Canterbury.  
Not long after his Death the Danes arriving in Devonshire were met by 
Goda Lieutenant of that Country, and Strenwold a valiant Leader, who put 
back the Danes, but with loss of their own Lives.  The third year 
following,24. under the Conduct of Justin and Guthmund the Son of 
Steytan,25. they landed and spoil'd Ipswich, fought with Britnoth Duke 
of the East-Angles about Maldon, where they slew him; the slaughter else 
had been equal on both sides.  These and the like Depredations on every 
side the English not able to resist, by Counsel of Siric then Archbishop 
of Canterbury, and two Dukes Ethelward and Alfric, it was thought best 
for the present to buy that with Silver which they could not gain with 
their Iron; and ten thousand Pounds was paid to the Danes for Peace.  
Which for a while contented; but taught them the ready way how easiest 
to come by more.  The next year but one26. they took by storm and rifled 
Bebbanburg an antient City nigh Durham:27. sailing thence into the mouth 
of Humber, they wasted both sides therof, Yorkshire and Lindsey, burning 
and destroying all before them.  Against these went out three Noblemen, 
Frana, Frithegist, and Godwin; but being all Danes by the Father's side, 
willingly began flight, and forsook their own Forces betray'd to the 
Enemy.  No less Treachery was at Sea;28. for Alfric the Son of Elfer 
Duke of Mercia, whom the King for some Offence had banish'd, but now 
recall'd,29. sent from London with a Fleet to surprize the Danes, in 
some place of disadvantage, gave them over night intelligence therof, 
then fled to them himself; which his Fleet, saith Florent, perceiving, 
pursu'd, took the Ship, but miss'd of his Person; the Londoners by 
chance grapling with the East-Angles made them fewer, saith my 
Author,30. by many thousands.31.  Others say, that by this notice of 
Alfric, the Danes not only escap'd, but with a greater Fleet set upon 
the English, took many of their Ships, and in triumph brought them up 
the Thames, intending to besiege London: for Anlaf King of Norway, and 
Swane of Denmark, at the head of these, came with 94 Galleys.  The King 
for this Treason of Alfric, put out his Son's Eyes; but the Londoners 
both by Land and Water, so valiantly resisted their Besiegers, that they 
were forc'd in one day, with great loss to give over.  But what they 
could not on the City, they wreck'd themselves on the Countries round 
about, wasting with Sword and Fire all Essex, Kent, and Sussex.  Thence 
horsing their Foot, diffus'd far wider their outragious Incursions, 
without mercy either to Sex or Age.  The slothful King, instead of 
Warlike Opposition in the field, sends Embassadors to treat about 
another Payment;32. the Sum promis'd was not sixteen thousand Pounds; 
till which paid, the Danes winter'd at Southampton; Ethelred inviting 
Anlaf to come and visit him at Andover,33. where he was royally 
entertain'd, some say baptiz'd, or confirm'd, adopted Son by the King, 
and dismiss'd with great Presents, promising by Oath to depart and 
molest the Kingdom no more;34. which he perform'd, but the Calamity 
ended not so, for after some intermission of their Rage for three years, 
the other Navy of Danes sailing about to the West,35. enter'd Severn, 
and wasted one while South-Wales, then Cornwal and Devonshire, till at 
length they winter'd about Tavistoc.36.  For it were an endless work to 
relate how they wallow'd up and down to every particular place, and to 
repeat as oft what Devastations they wrought, what Desolations left 
behind them, easy to be imagin'd.  In some, the next year37. they 
afflicted Dorsetshire, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight;38. by the 
English many Resolutions were taken, many Armies rais'd, but either 
betray'd by the falshood, or discourag'd by the weakness of their 
Leaders, they were put to rout or disbanded themselves.  For Soldiers 
most commonly are as their Commanders, without much odds of Valour in 
one Nation or other, only as they are more or less wisely disciplin'd 
and conducted.  The following year39. brought them back upon Kent, where 
they enter'd Medway, and besieg'd Rochester;40. but the Kentish Men 
assembling, gave them a sharp Encounter, yet that suffic'd not to hinder 
them from doing as they had done in other places.  Against these 
Depopulations, the King levied an Army; but the unskilful Leaders not 
knowing what to do with it when they had it, did but drive out time, 
burdening and impoverishing the People, consuming the public Treasure, 
and more emboldening the Enemy, then if they had sat quiet at home.  
What cause mov'd the Danes next year41. to pass into Normandy, is not 
recorded; but that they return'd thence more outrageous then before.42.  
Mean while the King, to make some diversion, undertakes an Expedition 
both by Land and Sea into Cumberland, where the Danes were most planted; 
there and in the Isle of Man, or, as Camden saith, Anglesey, imitating 
his Enemies in spoiling and unpeopling.  The Danes from Normandy, 
arriving in the River Ex, laid siege to Exeter;43. but the Citizens, as 
those of London, valorously defending themselves,44. they wreck'd their 
Anger, as before, on the Villages round about.  The Country People of 
Somerset and Devonshire assembling themselves at Penho, shew'd their 
readiness, but wanted a Head; and besides being then but few in number, 
were easily put to flight; the Enemy plundering all at will, with loaded 
Spoils pass'd into the Isle of Wight; from whence all Dorsetshire and 
Hampshire, felt again their Fury.  The Saxon annals write, that before 
their coming to Exeter, the Hampshire Men had a bickering with them, 
wherin Ethelward the King's General was slain,45. adding other things 
hardly to be understood, and in one ancient Copy; so end.46.  Ethelred, 
whom no Adversity could awake from his soft and sluggish Life, still 
coming by the worse at fighting, by the advice of his Peers not unlike 
himself, sends one of his gay Courtiers, though looking loftily, to 
stoop basely and propose a third Tribute to the Danes: they willingly 
hearken, but the Sum in enhaunc'd now to 24 thousand Pounds, and paid; 
the Danes therupon abstaining from Hostility.  But the King to 
strengthen his House by some potent Affinity, marries Emma, whom the 
Saxons call Elgive, Daughter of Richard Duke of Normandy.47.  With him 
Ethelred formerly had War or no good Correspondence, as appears by a 
Letter of Pope John the 15th, who made peace between them about eleven 
years before;48. puff'd up now with his suppos'd access of Strength by 
this Affinity,49. he caus'd the Danes all over England, though now 
living peaceably, in one day perfidiously to be massacred, both Men, 
Women and Children;50. sending private Letters to every Town and City, 
wherby they might be ready all at the same hour; which till the 
appointed time (being the 9th of July ) was conceal'd with great 
silence,51. and perform'd with much Unanimity; so generally hated were 
the Danes.  Mat. West. writes, that this Execution upon the Danes was 
ten years after; that Huna, one of Ethelred's Chief Captains, 
complaining of the Danish Insolencies in time of Peace, their Pride, 
their ravishing of Matrons and Virgins, incited the King to this 
Massacre, which in the madness of Rage made no difference of innocent or 
nocent.  Among these, Gunhildis the Sister of Swane was not spar'd, 
though much deserving not Pity only, but all Protection: she with her 
Husband Earl Palingus, coming to live in England, and receiving 
Christianity, had her Husband and young Son slain before her face, 
herself then beheaded, foretelling and denouncing that her Blood would 
cost England dear.52.  Some say this was done by the Traitor Edric, to 
whose custody she was committed; but the Massacre was some years before 
Edric's advancement; and if it were done by him afterwards, it seems to 
contradict the private Correspondence which he was thought to hold with 
the Danes.  For Swane breathing Revenge, hasted the next year into 
England,53. and by the treason or negligence of Count Hugh,54. whom Emma 
had recommended to the Government of Devonshire, sack'd the City of 
Exeter, her Wall from East to West-gate broken down: after this wasting 
Wiltshire, the People of that County, and of Hampshire, came together in 
great numbers with resolution stoutly to oppose him; but Alfric their 
General, whose Son's Eyes the King had lately put out, madly thinking to 
revenge himself on the King, by ruining his own Country, when he should 
have order'd his Battel, the Enemy being at hand, feign'd himself taken 
with a vomiting; wherby his Army in great discontent, destitute of a 
Commander, turn'd from the Enemy: who streight took Wilton and 
Salisbury, carrying the Pillage therof to the Ships.  Thence the next 
year landing on the Coast of Norfolk,55. he wasted the Country, and set 
Norwich on fire;56. Ulfketel Duke of the East-Angles, a Man of great 
Valour, not having space to gather his Forces, after Consultation had, 
thought it best to make peace with the Dane, which he breaking within 
three Weeks, issu'd silently out of his Ships, came to Thetford, staid 
there a night, and in the morning left it flaming.  Ulfketel hearing 
this, commanded some to go and break or burn his Ships; but they not 
daring or neglecting, he in the mean while with what secrecy and speed 
was possible, drawing together his Forces, went out against the Enemy, 
and gave them a fierce Onset retreating to their Ships; but much 
inferior in number, many of the chief East-Angles there lost their 
Lives. Nor did the Danes come off without great slaughter of their 
own;57. confessing that they never met in England with so rough a 
Charge.58.  The next year,59. whom War could not, a great Famine drove 
Swane out of the Land.60.  But the Summer following, another great Fleet 
of Danes enter'd the Port of Sandwich, thence pour'd out over all Kent 
and Sussex, made prey of what they found.  The King levying an Army out 
of Mercia, and the West-Saxons, took on him for once the Manhood to go 
out and face them; but they who held it safer to live by Rapine, then to 
hazard a Battel, shifting lightly from place to place, frustrated the 
slow motions of a heavy Camp, following their wonted course of Robbery, 
then running to their Ships.  Thus all Autumn they wearied out the 
King's Army, which gone home to winter, they carried all their Pillage 
to the Isle of Wight, and there stayed till Christmas; at which time the 
King being in Shropshire, and but ill employ'd (for by the procurement 
of Edric, he caus'd, as is thought, Alfhelm a noble Duke, treacherously 
to be slain,61. and the Eyes of his two Sons to be put out) they came 
forth again, over-running Hampshire, and Berkshire, as far as Reading 
and Wallingford: thence to Ashdune, and other places therabout, neither 
known nor of tolerable pronunciation; and returning by another way, 
found many of the People in Arms by the River Kenet; but making their 
way through, they got safe with vast booty to their Ships.  The King and 
his Courtiers wearied out with their last Summer's jaunt62. after the 
nimble Danes to no purpose, which by proof they found too toilsome for 
their soft Bones, more us'd to Beds and Couches, had recourse to their 
last and only remedy, their Coffers;63. and send now the fourth time to 
buy a dishonorable Peace, every time still dearer, not to be had now 
under 36 thousand Pound (for the Danes knew how to milk such easy Kine) 
in name of Tribute and Expences: which out of the People over all 
England, already half beggar'd, was extorted and paid.  About the same 
time Ethelred advanc'd Edric, surnam'd Streon, from obscure condition to 
be Duke of Mercia, and marry Edgitha the King's Daughter.  The cause of 
his advancement, Florent of Worcester, and Mat. West. attribute to his 
great Wealth, gotten by fine Policies and a plausible Tongue: he prov'd 
a main accessory to the ruin of England, as his actions will soon 
declare.  Ethelred the next year64. somewhat rousing himself, ordain'd 
that every 310 Hides65. (a Hide is so much Land as one Plow can 
sufficiently till) should set out a Ship or Galley, and every nine Hides 
find a Corslet and Head-piece: new Ships in every Port were built, 
victual'd, fraught with stout Mariners and Soldiers, and appointed to 
meet all at Sandwich.  A man might now think that all would go well; 
when suddenly a new mischief sprung up, dissension among the great ones; 
which brought all this diligence to as little success as at other times 
before.  Birthric the Brother of Edric, falsly accus'd Wulnoth a great 
Officer set over the South-Saxons, who fearing the potency of his 
Enemies, with 20 Ships got to Sea, and practis'd Piracy on the Coast.  
Against whom, reported to be in a place where he might be easily 
surpriz'd, Birthric sets forth with 20 Ships; all which driven back by a 
Tempest and wreck'd upon the shore,were burnt soon after by Wulnoth.  
Dishearten'd with this misfortune, the King returns to London, the rest 
of his Navy after him; and all this great preparation to nothing.  
Whereupon Turkill, a Danish Earl, came with a Navy to the Isle of 
Tanet,66. and in August a far greater, led by Heming and Ilaf, join'd 
with him.67.  Thence coasting to Sandwich, and landed, they went onward 
and began to assault Canterbury; but the Citizens and East-Kentish men, 
coming to composition with them for three thousand Pounds, they departed 
thence to the Isle of Wight, robbing and burning by the way.  Against 
these the King levies an Army through all the Land, and in several 
Quarters places them nigh the Sea, but so unskilfully or unsuccessfully, 
that the Danes were not therby hinder'd from exercising their wonted 
Robberies.  It happen'd that the Danes were one day gone up into the 
Country far from their Ships; the King having notice therof, thought to 
intercept them in their return; his men were resolute to overcome or 
die, time and place advantageous; but where Courage and Fortune was not 
wanting, there wanted Loyalty among them.  Edric with suttle Arguments 
that had a shew of deep Policy, disputed and persuaded the simplicity of 
his fellow Counsellors, that it would be best consulted at that time to 
let the Danes pass without ambush or interception.  The Danes where they 
expected danger, finding none, pass'd on with great joy and booty to 
their Ships.  After this, sailing about Kent, they lay that Winter in 
the Thames, forcing Kent and Essex to Contribution, oft-times attempting 
the City of London, but repuls'd as oft to their great loss.  Spring 
begun,68. leaving their Ships, they pass'd through Chiltern Wood into 
Oxfordshire, burnt the City,69. and thence returning with divided Forces 
wasted on both sides the Thames;70. but hearing that an Army from London 
was marched out against them, they on the North-side passing the River 
at Stanes, join'd with them on the South into one Body, and enrich'd 
with great Spoils, came back through Surrey to their Ships; which all 
the Lent-time they repair'd.  After Easter sailing to the East-Angles, 
they arriv'd at Ipswich, and came to a place call'd Ringmere, where they 
heard that Ulfketel with his Forces lay, who with a sharp encounter soon 
entertain'd them; but his men at length giving back, through the 
subtlety of a Danish Servant among them who began the flight, lost the 
Field; though the men of Cambridgeshire stood to it valiantly.  In this 
Battel Ethelstan the King's Son-in-Law, with many other Noblemen, were 
slain; wherby the Danes without more resistance, three Months together 
had the spoiling of those Countries and all the Fens, burnt Thetford and 
Grantbrig, or Cambridge; thence to a hilly place not far off, call'd by 
Huntingdon Balesham, by Camden Gogmagog Hills, and the Villages 
therabout they turn'd their Fury, slaying all they met save one Man, who 
getting up into a Steeple, is said to have defended himself against the 
whole Danish Army.  They therfore so leaving him, their Foot by Sea, 
their Horse by Land, through Essex, return'd back laden to their Ships 
left in the Thames.  But many days pass'd not between, when sallying 
again out of their ships as out of savage Dens, they plunder'd over 
again all Oxfordshire, and added to their prey Buckingham, Bedford, and 
Hertfordshire;71. then like wild Beasts glutted, returning to their 
Caves.  A third excursion they made into Northampton, ransacking the 
Country round; then as to fresh Pasture betook them to the West-Saxons, 
and in like sort harrassing all Wiltshire, return'd, as I said before, 
like wild Beasts or rather Sea-Monsters to their Water-stables, 
accomplishing by Christmas the Circuit of their whole year's good Deeds; 
an unjust and inhuman Nation, who receiving or not receiving Tribute 
where none was owing them, made such destruction of Mankind, and rapine 
of their Livelihood, as is a misery to read.  Yet here they ceas'd 
not;72. for the next year repeating the same Cruelties on both sides the 
Thames,73. one way as far as Huntingdon, the other as far as Wiltshire 
and Southampton, sollicited again by the King for Peace, and receiving 
their demands both of Tribute and Contribution, they slighted their 
Faith; and in the beginning of September laid seige to Canterbury.  On 
the twentieth Day, by the Treachery of Almere the Archdeacon they took 
part of it and burnt it, committing all sorts of Massacre as a sport; 
some they threw over the Well, others into the Fire, hung some by the 
privy Members, Infants pull'd from their Mothers Breasts, were either 
tost on Spears, or Carts drawn over them; Matrons and Virgins by the 
Hair drag'd and ravish'd.74.  Alfage the grave Archbishop above others 
hated of the Danes,75. as in all Counsels and Actions to his might their 
known opposer, taken, wounded, imprison'd in a noisome Ship; the 
Multitude are tyth'd, and every tenth only spar'd.76.  Early the next 
year77. before Easter, while Ethelred and his Peers were assembled at 
London,78. to raise now the fifth Tribute amounting to 48 thousand 
Pound, the Danes at Canterbury propose to the Archbishop, who had been 
now seven months their Prisoner, Life and Liberty, if he pay them three 
thousand Pound;79. which he refusing as not able of himself, and not 
willing to extort it from his Tenants, is permitted all the next Sunday 
to consider; then hal'd before their Counsel, of whom Turkill was Chief, 
and still refusing, they rise most of them being drunk, and beat him 
with the blunt side of their Axes, then thrust forth deliver him to be 
pelted with Stones; till one Thrum a converted Dane, pitying him half 
dead, to put him out of pain, with a pious impiety, at one stroke of his 
Ax on the head dispatch'd him.  His Body was carry'd to London, and 
there buried, thence afterward remov'd to Canterbury.  By this time the 
Tribute paid, and Peace so often violated sworn again by the Danes, they 
dispers'd their Fleet; forty five of them, and Turkill their Chief staid 
at London with the King, swore him Allegiance to defend his Land against 
all Strangers, on condition only to be fed and cloath'd by him.  But 
this voluntary friendship of Turkill was thought to be deceitful, that 
staying under this pretence he gave intelligence to Swane, when most it 
would be seasonable to come.  In July therfore of the next year, King 
Swane arriving at Sandwich, made no stay there, but sailing first to 
Humber, thence into Trent, landed and encamp'd at Gainsburrow: whither 
without delay repair'd to him the Northumbrians, with Uthred their Earl; 
those of Lindsey also, then those of Fisburg, and lastly all on the 
North of Watling-street (which is a high-way from East to West-Sea) gave 
Oath and Hostages to obey him.  From whom he commanded Horses and 
Provisions for his Army, taking with him besides Bands and Companies of 
their choicest Men; and committing to his Son Canute the care of his 
Fleet and Hostages, he marches towards the South-Mercians, commanding 
his Soldiers to exercise all Acts of Hostility; with the Terror wherof 
fully executed, he took in few days the City of Oxford, then Winchester; 
thence tending to London, in his hasty passage over the Thames, without 
seeking Bridge or Ford, lost many of his Men.  Nor was his Expedition 
against London prosperous; for assaying all means by force or wile to 
take the City, wherin the King then was, and Turkill with his Danes, he 
was stoutly beaten off as at other times.  Thence back to Wallingford 
and Bath, directing his course, after usual havock made, he sat a while 
and refresh'd his Army.  There Ethelm an Earl of Devonshire, and other 
great Officers in the West, yielded him Subjection.  These things 
flowing to his wish, he betook him to his Navy, from that time stil'd 
and accounted King of England, if a Tyrant, saith Simeon, may be call'd 
a King.  The Londoners also sent him Hostages, and made their peace, for 
they fear'd his Fury.  Ethelred thus reduc'd to narrow compass, sent 
Emma his Queen, with his two Sons had by her, and all his Treasure to 
Richard II. her Brother, Duke of Normandy; where he was honourably 
receiv'd at Roan by the Duke, though known to have born himself 
churlishly and proudly towards Emma his Sister, besides his dissolute 
Company with other Women.80.  Mean while Swane ceas'd not to exact 
almost insupportable Tribute of the People, spoiling them when he 
listed; besides, the like did Turkill at Greenwich.  The next Year 
beginning,81. Swane sickens and dies;82. some say terrify'd and smitten 
by an appearing Shape of St. Edmund arm'd,83. whose Church at Bury he 
had threaten'd to demolish; but the Authority herof relies only upon the 
Legend of St. Edmund.  After his death the Danish Army and Fleet made 
his Son Canute their King; but the Nobility and States of England sent 
Messengers to Ethelred, declaring that they prefer'd none before their 
native Sovereign, if he would promise to govern them better then he had 
done, and with more Clemency.  Wherat the King rejoicing, sends over his 
Son Edward with Embassadors to court both high and low, and win their 
Love, promising largely to be their mild and devoted Lord, to consent in 
all things to their Will, follow their Counsel, and whatever had been 
done or spoken by any Man against him, freely to pardon, if they would 
loyally restore him to be their King.  To this the People cheerfully 
answer'd, and Amity was both promis'd and confirm'd on both sides.  An 
Embassy of Lords is sent to bring back the King honourably; he returns 
in Lent, and is joyfully receiv'd of the People, marches with a strong 
Army against Canute; who having got Horses and join'd with the Men of 
Lindsey, was preparing to make spoil in the Countries adjoining; but by 
Ethelred unexpectedly coming upon him, was soon driven to his Ships, and 
his Confederates of Lindsey left to the Anger of their Country-men, 
executed without Mercy both by Fire and Sword.  Canute in all haste 
sailing back to Sandwich, took the Hostages given to his Father from all 
parts of England, and with slit Noses, Ears cropt, and Hands chop'd off, 
setting them ashore, departd into Denmark.  Yet the People were not 
disburden'd, for the King rais'd out of them 30 thousand Pound to pay 
his Fleet of Danes at Greenwich.  To these Evils the Sea in October 
pass'd his Bounds, overwhelming many Towns in England, and of their 
Inhabitants many thousands.  The Year following84. an Assembly being at 
Oxford, Edric of Streon having invited two Noblemen, Sigeferth and 
Morcar, the Sons of Earngrun of Seavenburg, to his Lodging, secretly 
murder'd them;85. the King, for what cause is unknown, seiz'd their 
Estates, and caus'd Algith the Wife of Sigeferth, to be kept at 
Maidulfsburg, now Malmsbury; whom Edmund the Prince there married 
against his Father's mind, then went and possess'd their Lands, making 
the People there subject to him.  Mat. Westm. saith, that these two were 
of the Danes who had seated themselves in Northumberland, slain by Edric 
under colour of Teason laid to their charge.86. They who attended them 
without, tumulting at the Death of their Masters, were beaten back; and 
driven into a Church, defending themselves were burnt there in the 
Steeple.  Mean while Canute returning from Denmark with a great Navy, 
200 Ships richly gilded and adorn'd, well fraught with Arms and all 
Provision;87. and, which Encomium Emm[ae] mentions not, two other Kings, 
Lachman of Sweden, Olav of Norway, arriv'd at Sandwich; and, as the same 
Author then living writes, sent out Spies to discover what Resistance on 
Land was to be expected, who return'd with certain Report, that a great 
Army of English was in readiness to oppose them.  Turkill, who upon the 
arrival of these Danish Powers kept Faith no longer with the English, 
but joining now with Canute,88. as it were to reingratiate himself after 
his Revolt, whether real or complotted, counsel'd him (being yet young) 
not to land, but to leave to him the management of this first Battel: 
the King assented, and he with the Forces which he had brought, and part 
of those which arriv'd with Canute, landing to their wish, encounter'd 
the English, though double in number, at a place call'd Scorastan, and 
was at first beaten back with much Loss.  But at length animating his 
Men with Rage only and Despair, obtain'd a clear Victory, which won him 
great Reward and Possessions from Canute.  But of this Action no other 
Writer makes mention.  From Sandwich therfore sailing about to the River 
Frome, and there landing, over all Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire, he 
spread wastful Hostility.89.  The King lay then sick at Cosham in this 
Country; though it may seem strange how he could lie sick there in the 
midst of his Enemies.  Howbeit Edmund in one part, and Edric of Streon 
in another, rais'd Forces by themselves; but so soon as both Armies were 
united, the Traytor Edric being found to practise against the Life of 
Edmund, he remov'd with his Army from him; wherof the Enemy took great 
advantage.  Edric easily enticing the 40 Ships of Danes to side with 
him, revolted to Canute; the West-Saxons also gave Pledges, and 
furnish'd him with Horses.  By which means the Year ensuing,90. he with 
Edric the Traytor passing the Thames at Creclad, about Twelftide,91. 
enter'd into Mercia, and especially Warwickshire, depopulating all 
places in their way.  Against these Prince Edmund, for his hardiness 
call'd Ironside, gather'd an Army; but the Mercians refus'd to fight 
unless Ethelred with the Londoners came to aid them; and so every Man 
return'd home.  After the Festival Edmund gathering another Army, 
besought his Father to come with the Londoners, and what Force besides 
he was able; they came with great strength gotten together, but being 
come, and in a hopeful way of good success, it was told the King, that 
unless he took the better heed, some of his own Forces would fall off 
and betray him.  The King daunted with this perhaps cunning Whisper of 
the Enemy, disbanding his Army, returns to London.  Edmund betook him 
into Northumberland, as some thought to raise fresh Forces; but he with 
Earl Uthred on the one side, and Canute with Edric on the other, did 
little else but waste the Provinces; Canute to conquer them, Edmund to 
punish them who stood neuter: for which cause Stafford, Shropshire, and 
Leicestershire, felt heavily his hand; while Canute, who was ruining the 
more Southern Shires, at length march'd into Northumberland; which 
Edmund hearing, dismiss'd his Forces and came to London.  Uthred the 
Earl hasted back to Northumberland, and finding no other Remedy, 
submitted himself with all the Northumbrians, giving Hostages to Canute.  
Nevertheless by his Command or Connivance, and the hand of one Turebrand 
a Danish Lord, Uthred was slain, and Iric another Dane made Earl in his 
stead.  This Uthred Son of Walteof, as Simeon writes, in his Treatise of 
the Siege of Durham, in his Youth obtain'd a great Victory against 
Malcolm Son of Kened King of Scots, who with the whole Power of his 
Kingdom was fallen into Northumberland, and laid siege to Durham.  
Walteof the old Earl unable to resist, had secur'd himself in 
Bebbanburg, a strong Town; but Uthred gathering an Army rais'd the 
Siege, slew most of the Scots, their King narrowly escaping, and with 
the Heads of their slain fix'd upon Poles beset round the Walls of 
Durham.  The Year of this Exploit Simeon clears not, for in 969, and in 
the Reign of Ethelred, as he affirms, it could not be.  Canute by 
another way returning Southward, joyful of his Success, before Easter 
came back with all the Army to his Fleet.  About the end of April 
ensuing, Ethelred after a long, troublesome and ill-govern'd Reign, 
ended his days at London, and was buried in the Church of St. Paul.

EDMUND IRONSIDE.

After the Decease of Ethelred, they of the Nobility who were then at 
London,92. together with the Citizens, chose Edmund his Son (not by 
Emma, but a former Wife the Daughter of Earl Thored )93. in his Father's 
room; but the Archbishops, Abbots, and many of the Nobles assembling 
together, elected Canute; and coming to Southampton where he then 
remain'd, renounc'd before him all the Race of Ethelred, and swore him 
Fidelity: he also swore to them, in Matters both religious and secular, 
to be their faithful Lord.  But Edmund with all speed going to the West-
Saxons,94. was joyfully receiv'd of them as their King,95. and of many 
other Provinces by their Example.  Mean while Canute about mid May came 
with his whole Fleet up the River to London; then causing a great Dike 
to be made on Surrey- side, turn'd the Stream, and drew his Ships 
thither West of the Bridge; then begirting the City with a broad and 
deep Trench, assail'd it on every side; but repuls'd as before by the 
valorous Defendants, and in despair of Success at that time, leaving 
part of his Army for the Defence of his Ships, with the rest sped him to 
the West-Saxons, ere Edmund could have time to assemble all his Powers: 
who yet with such as were at hand invoking Divine Aid, encounter'd the 
Danes at Pen by Gillingham in Dorsetshire, and put him to flight.  After 
Midsummer, increast with new Forces, he met with him again at a Place 
call'd Sherastan, now Sharstan; but Edric, Almar, and Algar, with the 
Hampshire and Wiltshire Men, then siding with the Danes, he only 
maintain'd the Fight, obstinately fought on both sides, till Night and 
Weariness parted them.  Day-light returning renew'd the Conflict, wherin 
the Danes appearing inferior, Edric to dishearten the English cuts off 
the Head of one Osmer, in Countenance and Hair somewhat resembling the 
King, and holding it up, cries aloud to the English, that Edmund being 
slain, and this his Head, it was time for them to fly; which Fallacy 
Edmund Perceiving, and openly shewing himself to his Soldiers, by a 
Spear thrown at Edric, that missing him yet slew one next him, and 
through him another behind,96. they recover'd heart, and lay sore upon 
the Danes till Night parted them as before: for ere the third Morn, 
Canute sensible of his Loss, march'd away by stealth to his Ships at 
London, renewing there his Leagre.96a.  Some would have this Battel at 
Sherastan the same with that at Scorastan before mention'd, but the 
circumstance of time permits not that, having bin before the landing of 
Canute, this a good while after, as by the Process of things appears.  
From Sherastan or Sharstan Edmund return'd to the West-Saxons, whose 
Valour Edric fearing, lest it might prevail against the Danes, sought 
Pardon of his Revolt, and obtaining it, swore Loyalty to the King, who 
now the third time coming with an Army from the West-Saxons to London, 
rais'd the Siege, chasing Canute and his Danes to their Ships.  Then 
after two days passing the Thames at Brentford, and so coming on their 
backs, kept them so turn'd, and obtain'd the Victory; then returns again 
to his West-Saxons, and Canute to his Siege, but still in vain; rising 
therfore thence, he enter'd with his Ships a River then call'd Arenne; 
and from the Banks therof wasted Mercia; thence their Horse by Land, 
their Foot by Ship came to Medway.  Edmund in the mean while with 
multiply'd Forces out of many Shires crossing again at Brentford, came 
into Kent, seeking Canute; encounter'd him at Otford, and so defeated, 
that of his Horse, they who escap'd fled to the Isle of Sheppey; and a 
full Victory he had gain'd, had not Edric still the Traytor by some Wile 
or other detain'd his pursuit: and Edmund who never wanted Courage, here 
wanted Prudence to be so misled, ever after forsaken of his wonted 
Fortune.  Canute crossing with his Army into Essex, thence wasted Mercia 
worse then before, and with heavy Prey return'd to his Ships: them 
Edmund with a collected Army pursuing, overtook at a place call'd 
Assandune or Assesbill, now Ashdown in Essex; the Battel on either side 
was fought with great Vehemence;97. but perfidious Edric perceiving the 
Victory to incline towards Edmund, with that part of the Army which was 
under him, fled, as he had promis'd Canute, and left the King over-
match'd with Numbers: By which Desertion the English were overthrown, 
Duke Alfric, Duke Godwin and Ulfketel the valiant Duke of East-Angles, 
with a great part of the Nobility slain, so as the English of a long 
time had not received a greater Blow.  Yet after a while Edmund not 
absurdly call'd Ironside, preparing again to try his Fortune in another 
field, was hinder'd by Edric and others of his Faction, advising him to 
make Peace and divide the Kingdom with Canute.98.  To which Edmund over-
rul'd, a Treaty appointed, and Pledges mutually given, both Kings met 
together at a place call'd Deorhirst in Glocestershire; Edmund on the 
West-side of Severn, Canute on the East with their Armies, then both in 
Person wafted into an Island, at that time call'd Olanege, now Alney, in 
the middle of the River;99. swearing Amity and Brotherhood, they parted 
the Kingdom between them.  Then interchanging Arms and the Habit they 
wore, assessing also what Pay should be allotted to the Navy, they 
departed each his way.  concerning this interview and the cause therof, 
others write otherwise; Malmsbury, that Edmund grieving at the loss of 
so much Blood spilt for the Ambition only of two Men striving who should 
reign, of his own accord sent to Canute, offering him single Combat, to 
prevent in their own cause the effusion of more Blood then their own; 
that Canute, though of Courage enough, yet not unwisely doubting to 
adventure his Body of small Timber, against a Man of Iron sides, refus'd 
the Combat, offering to divide the Kingdom.  This Offer pleasing both 
Armies, Edmund was not difficult to consent; and the decision was that 
he as his hereditary Kingdom should rule the West-Saxons and all the 
South, Canute the Mercians and the North.  Huntingdon follow'd by Mat. 
Westm. relates, that the Peers on every side wearied out with continual 
Warfare, and not refraining to affirm openly, that they two who expected 
to reign singly, had most reason to fight singly, the Kings were 
content; the Island was their Lists, the Combat knightly; till Knute 
finding himself too weak, began to parley, which ended as is said 
before.  After which the Londoners bought their Peace of the Danes, and 
permitted them to winter in the City.  But King Edmund about the Feast 
of St. Andrew, unexpectedly deceas'd at London, and was buried near to 
Edgar his Grandfather at Glaston.  The cause of his so sudden death is 
uncertain; common Fame, saith Malmsbury, lays the Guilt therof upon 
Edric, who to please Canute, allur'd with promise of Reward two of the 
King's Privy Chamber, though at first abhorring the Fact, to assassinate 
him at the Stool, by thrusting a sharp Iron into his hinder parts.  
Huntingdon, and Mat. Westm. relate it done at Oxford by the Son of 
Edric, and something vary in the manner, not worth recital.  Edmund 
dead, Canute meaning to reign sole King of England, calls to him all the 
Dukes, Barons, and Bishops of the Land, cunningly demanding of them who 
were Witnesses what agreement was made between him and Edmund dividing 
the Kingdom, whether the Sons and Brothers of Edmund were to govern the 
West-Saxons after him, Canute living?  They who understood his meaning, 
and fear'd to undergo his Anger, timorously answer'd, that Edmund they 
knew had left no part therof to his Sons or Brethren, living or dying; 
but that he intended Canute should be their Guardian, till they came to 
age of reigning.  Simeon affirms, that for fear or hope of Reward they 
attested what was not true: notwithstanding which, he put many of them 
to death not long after.

CANUTE, or KNUTE.

Canute having thus sounded the Nobility,100. and by them understood, 
receiv'd their Oath of Fealty,101. they the pledge of his bare hand, and 
Oath from the Danish Nobles; wherupon the House of Edmund was renounc'd, 
and Canute crown'd.102.  Then they enacted, that Edwi Brother of Edmund, 
a Prince of great hope, should be banish'd the Realm.  But Canute not 
thinking himself secure while Edwi liv'd, consulted with Edric how to 
make him away; who told him of one Ethelward a decay'd Nobleman, 
likeliest to do the work.  Ethelward sent for, and tempted by the King 
in private with largest Rewards, but abhorring in his mind the deed, 
promis'd to do it when he saw his opportunity; and so still defer'd it.  
But Edwi afterwards receiv'd into favour as a snare, was by him or some 
other of his false Friends, Canute contriving it, the same year slain.  
Edric also counsell'd him to dispatch Edward and Edmund, the Sons of 
Ironside; but the King doubting that the Fact would seem too foul done 
in England, sent them to the King of Sweden, with the like intent; but 
he disdaining the Office, sent them for better safety to Solomon King of 
Hungary; where Edmund at length died, but Edward married Agatha Daughter 
to Henry the German Emperor.  A Digression in the Laws of Edward 
Confessor under the Title of Lex Noricorum saith, that this Edward for 
fear of Canute, fled of his own accord to Malesclot King of the Rugians, 
who receiv'd him honourably, and of that Country gave him a Wife.  
Canute settled in his Throne, divided the Government of his Kingdom into 
four parts; the West-Saxons to himself, the East-Angles to Earl Turkill, 
the Mercians to Edric, the Northumbrians to Iric; then made peace with 
all Princes round about him, and his former Wife being dead, in July 
married Emma the Widow of King Ethelred.  The Christmas following was an 
ill Feast to Edric, of whose Treason the King having now made use as 
much as serv'd his turn, and fearing himself to be the next betray'd, 
caus'd him to be slain at London in the Palace, thrown over the City 
Wall, and there to lie unburied; the Head of Edric fixt on a Pole, he 
commanded to be set on the highest Tower of London, as in a double sense 
he had promis'd him, for the murder of King Edmund to exalt him above 
all the Peers of England.  Huntingdon, Malmsbury, and Mat. Westm. write, 
that suspecting the King's intention to degrade him from his Mercian 
Dukedom, and upbraiding him with his Merits, the King enrag'd, caus'd 
him to be strangled in the room, and out at a Window thrown into the 
Thames.103.  Another writes, that Eric at the King's command struck off 
his Head.104.  Other great Men, though without fault, as Duke Norman the 
Son of Leofwin, Ethelward Son of Duke Agelmar, he put to death at the 
same time, jealous of their Power or Familiarity with Edric: and 
notwithstanding Peace, kept still his Army; to maintain which, the next 
year105. he squeez'd out of the English, though now his Subjects, not 
his Enemies, 72,106. some say, 82,000 Pound,107. besides 15,000 out of 
London.108.  Mean while great War arose at Carr, between Uthred Son of 
Waldef, Earl of Northumberland, and Malcolm Son of Kened King of Scots, 
with whom held Eugenius King of Lothian.  But here Simeon the relater 
seems to have committed some mistake, having slain Uthred by Canute two 
years before, and set Iric in his place: Iric therfore it must needs be, 
not Uthred, who manag'd this War against the Scots.  About which time at 
a Convention of Danes at Oxford, it was agreed on both Parties to keep 
the Laws of Edgar; Mat. Westm. saith of Edward the elder.  The next 
year109. Canute sail'd into Denmark,110. and there abode all Winter.  
Huntingdon and Mat. Westm. say, he went thither to repress the Swedes; 
and that the night before a Battel was fought with them, Godwin stealing 
out of the Camp with his English, assaulted the Swedes, and had got the 
Victory ere Canute in the morning knew of any Fight.  For which bold 
Enterprize, though against Discipline, he had the English in more esteem 
ever after.  In the Spring,111. at his return into England, he held in 
the time of Easter a great Assembly at Chicester,112. and the same year 
was with Turkill the Dane at the Dedication of a Church by them built at 
Assendune, in the place of that great Victory which won him the Crown.  
But suspecting his Greatness, the year following banish'd him the Realm, 
and found occasion to do the like by Iric the Northumbrian Earl upon the 
same jealousy.  Nor yet content with his Conquest of England,113. though 
now above ten years enjoy'd,114. he pass'd with 50 Ships into 
Norway,115. dispossess'd Olave their King, and subdu'd the Land,116. 
first with great Sums of Money sent the year before to gain him a Party, 
then coming with an Army to compel the rest.117.  Thence returning King 
of England, Denmark, and Norway,118. yet not secure in his mind, under 
colour of an Embassy he sent into banishment Hacun a powerful Dane,119. 
who had married the Daughter of his Sister Gunildis, having conceiv'd 
some suspicion of his Practices against him: but such course was taken, 
that he never came back; either perishing at Sea, or slain by 
contrivance the next year120. in Orkney.121.  Canute therfore having 
thus establish'd himself by bloodshed and oppression to wash away, as he 
thought, the Guilt therof, sailing again into Denmark, went thence to 
Rome,122. and offer'd there to St. Peter great Gifts of Gold and Silver, 
and other precious things;123. besides the usual Tribute of Romscot, 
giving great Alms by the way, both thither and back again,124. freeing 
many places of Custom and Toll with great Expence, where Strangers were 
wont to pay, having vow'd great amendment of Life at the Sepulchre of 
Peter and Paul, and to his whole People in a large Letter written from 
Rome yet extant.  At his return therfore he built and dedicated a Church 
at St. Edmund at Bury,125. whom his ancestors had slain, threw out the 
Secular Priests who had intruded there, and plac'd Monks in their 
stead;126. then going into Scotland, subdu'd and receiv'd Homage of 
Malcolm,127. and two other Kings there, Melbeath and Jermare.  Three 
years after128. having made Swane his suppos'd Son by Algiva of 
Northampton,129. Duke Alfhelm's Daughter (for others say the Son of a 
Priest whom Algiva barren had got ready at the time of her feign'd 
Labour)130. King of Norway, and Hardecnute his Son by Emma King of 
Denmark, and design'd Harold his Son by Algiva of Northampton King of 
England, died at Shaftsbury, and was buried at Winchester in the old 
Monastery.  This King, as appears, ended better then he began; for 
though he seems to have had no hand in the Death of Ironside, but 
detested the Fact, and bringing the Murderers, who came to him in hope 
of great Reward, forth among his Courtiers, as it were to receive 
thanks, after they had openly related the manner of their killing him, 
deliver'd them to deserv'd Punishment, yet he spar'd Edric whom he knew 
to be the prime Author of that detestable Fact; till willing to be rid 
of him, grown importune upon the Confidence of his Merits, and upbraided 
by him that he had first relinquish'd, then extinguish'd Edmund for his 
sake; angry to be so upbraided, therfore said he with a changed 
Countenance, Traitor to God and me, thou shalt die; thine own mouth 
accuses thee to have slain thy Master my Confederate Brother, and the 
Lord's Anointed.131.  Wherupon although present and private Execution 
was in rage done upon Edric, yet he himself in cool Blood scrupled not 
to make away the Brother and Children of Edmund, who had better right to 
be the Lord's Anointed here then himself.  When he had obtain'd in 
England what he desir'd, no wonder if he sought the love of his 
conquer'd Subjects for the love of his own Quiet, the maintainers of his 
Wealth and State for his own profit.  For the like reason he is thought 
to have married Emma, and that Richard Duke of Normandy her Brother 
might the less care what became of Elfred and Edward, her Sons by King 
Ethelred.  He commanded to be observ'd the ancient Saxon Laws, call'd 
afterwards the Laws of Edward the Confessor, not that he made them, but 
strictly observ'd them.  His Letter from Rome professes, if he had done 
aught amiss in his youth, through negligence or want of due temper, full 
resolution with the help of God to make amends, by governing justly and 
piously for the future; charges and adjures all his Officers and 
Viscounts, that neither for fear of him, or favour of any Person, or to 
enrich the King, they suffer Injustice to be done in that Land; commands 
his Treasurers to pay all his Debts ere his return home, which was by 
Denmark, to compose Matters there; and what his Letter profess'd, he 
perform'd all his Life after.  But it is a fond conceit in many great 
ones, and pernicious in the end, to cease from no Violence till they 
have attain'd the utmost of their Ambitions and Desires; then to think 
God appeas'd by their seeking to bribe him with a share however large of 
their ill-gotten Spoils, and then lastly to grow zealous of doing right, 
when they have no longer need to do wrong.  Howbeit Canute was famous 
through Europe, and much honour'd of Conrade the Emperor, then at Rome, 
with rich Gifts and many Grants of what he there demanded for the  
freeing of Passages from Toll and Custom.  I must not omit one 
remarkable Action done by him, as Huntingdon reports it, with great 
scene of Circumstance, and emphatical Expression, to shew the small 
Power of Kings in respect of God; which, unless to Court-Parasites, 
needed no such laborious Demonstration.  He caus'd his Royal Seat to be 
set on the shore, while the Tide was coming in; and with all the state 
that Royalty could put into his Countenance, said thus to the Sea: Thou 
Sea belongst to me, and the Land wheron I sit is mine; nor hath any one 
unpunish'd resisted my Commands: I charge thee come no farther upon my 
Land, neither presume to wet the Feet of thy Sovereign Lord.  But the 
Sea, as before, came rowling on, and without Reverence both wet and 
dash'd him.  Wherat the King quickly rising, wish'd all about him to 
behold and consider the weak and frivolous Power of a King, and that 
none indeed deserv'd the Name of a King, but he whose eternal Laws, both 
Heaven, Earth, and Sea obey.  A Truth so evident of it self, as I said 
before, that unless to shame his Court-Flatterers, who would not else be 
convinc'd, Canute needed not to have gone wet-shod home: The best is, 
from that time forth he never would wear a Crown, esteeming earthly 
Royalty contemptible and vain.

HAROLD.

Harold for his swiftness surnam'd Harefoot,132. the Son of Canute by 
Algiva of Northampton,133. (though some speak doubtfully as if she bore 
him not, but had him of a Shoe-maker's Wife, as Swane before of a 
Priest;134. others of a Maid-Servant, to conceal her barrenness)135. in 
a great Assembly at Oxford, was by Duke Leofric and the Mercians, with 
the Londoners, according to his Father's Testament, elected King;136. 
but without the Regal Habiliments,137. which [ae]lnot the Archbishop having 
in his Custody, refus'd to deliver up, but to the Sons of Emma, for 
which Harold ever after hated the Clergy; and (as the Clergy are wont 
thence to infer) all Religion.  Godwin Earl of Kent, and the West-Saxons 
with him stood for Hardecnute.  Malmsbury Saith, that the contest was 
between Dane and English; that the Danes, and Londoners grown now in a 
manner Danish, were all for Hardecnute: but he being then in Denmark, 
Harold prevail'd, yet so as that the Kingdom should be divided between 
them; the West and South part reserv'd by Emma for Hardecnute, till his 
return.  But Harold once advanc'd into the Throne, banish'd Emma his 
Mother-in law,138. seiz'd on his Father's Treasure at Winchester, and 
there remain'd.139.  Emma not holding it safe to abide in Normandy while 
Duke William the Bastard was yet under Age, retir'd to Baldwin Earl of 
Flanders.  In the mean while Elfred and Edward Sons of Ethelred, 
accompanied with a small number of Norman Soldiers in a few Ships, 
coming to visit their Mother Emma not yet departed the Land, and perhaps 
to see how the People were inclin'd to restore them their right, Elfred 
was sent for by the King then at London; but in his way met at Guilford, 
by Earl Godwin, who with all seeming friendship entertain'd him, was in 
the night surpriz'd and made Prisoner, most of his Company put to 
various sorts of cruel Death, decimated twice over; then brought to 
London, was by the King sent bound to Ely, had his Eyes put out by the 
way, and deliver'd to the Monks there, died soon after in their custody.  
Malmsbury gives little credit to this story of Elfred, as not chronicl'd 
in his time, but rumour'd only.  Which Emma however hearing, sent away 
her Son Edward, who by good hap accompanied not his Brother, with all 
speed into Normandy.  But the Author of Encomium Emm[ae], who seems plainly 
(though nameless) to have been some Monk, yet liv'd, and perhaps wrote 
within the same Year when these things were done; by his relation 
differing from all others, much aggravates the cruelty of Harold, that 
he not content to have practis'd in secret (for openly he durst not) 
against the Life of Emma, sought many treacherous ways to get her Son 
within his power; and resolv'd at length to forge a Letter in the name 
of their Mother, inviting them into England, the Copy of which Letter he 
produces written to this purpose.

Emma in name only Queen, to her Sons Edward and Elfred imparts motherly 
Salutation.  While we severally bewail the Death of our Lord the King, 
most dear Sons, and while daily you are depriv'd more and more of the 
Kingdom your Inheritance; I admire what Counsel ye take, knowing that 
your intermitted delay is a daily strengthning to the Reign of your 
Usurper, who incessantly goes about from Town to City, gaining the chief 
Nobles to his party, either by gifts, prayers, or threats.  But they had 
much rather one of you should reign over them, then to be held under the 
power of him who now over-rules them.  I entreat therfore that one of 
you come to me speedily, and privately, to receive from me wholesome 
Counsel, and to know how the business which I intend shall be 
accomplish'd.  By this Messenger present, send back what you determine.  
Farewel, as dear both as my own heart.

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">These Letters were sent to the Princes then in Normandy, by 
express Messengers, with presents also as from their Mother; which they 
joyfully receiving, return word by the same Messengers, that one of them 
will be with her shortly; naming both the time and place.  Elfred 
therfore the younger (for so it was thought best) at the appointed time, 
with a few Ships and small numbers about him appearing on the Coast, no 
sooner came ashore but fell into the snare of Earl Godwin, sent on 
purpose to betray him; as above was related.  Emma greatly sorrowing for 
the loss of her Son, thus cruelly made away, fled immediately with some 
of the Nobles her faithfullest Adherents into Flanders, had her dwelling 
assign'd at Bruges by the Earl; where having remain'd about two 
years,140. she was visited out of Denmark by Hardecnute her Son;141. and 
he not long had remain'd with her there, when Harold in England, having 
done nothing the while worth memory,142. save the taxing of every Port 
at 8 Marks of Silver to 16 Ships, died at London,143. some say at 
Oxford;144. and was buried at Winchester.145.  After which, most of the 
Nobility, both Danes and English now agreeing, send Ambassadors to 
Hardecnute still at Bruges with his Mother, entreating him to come and 
receive as his right the Scepter, who before Midsummer came with 60 
Ships, and many Soldiers out of Denmark.

HARDECNUTE.

Hardecnute receiv'd with acclamation, and seated in the Throne, first 
call'd to mind the Injuries done to him or his Mother Emma in the time 
of Harold; sent Alfric Archbishop of York, Godwin and others, with Troud 
his Executioner to London, commanding them to dig up the Body of King 
Harold, and throw it into a Ditch; but by a second order, into the 
Thames.    Whence taken up by a Fisherman, and convey'd to a Church-yard 
in London belonging to the Danes, it was interr'd again with honour.  
This done, he levied a sore Tax, that eight Marks to every Rower, and 
twelve to every Officer in his Fleet should be paid throughout England: 
by which time they who were so forward to call him over had enough of 
him; for he, as they thought, had too much of theirs.  After this he 
call'd to account Godwin Earl of Kent, and Leving Bishop of Worcester, 
about the Death of Elfred his half Brother, which Alfric the Archbishop 
laid to their charge; the King depriv'd Leving of his Bishoprick, and 
gave it to his accuser: but the year following, pacify'd with a round 
sum restor'd it to Leving.146.  Godwin made his peace by a sumptuous 
present, a Galley with a gilded Stem bravely rigg'd, and eighty Soldiers 
in her, every one with Bracelets of Gold on each Arm, weighing 16 
Ounces, Helmet, Corslet, and Hilts of his Sword gilded; a Danish Curtax 
lifted with Gold or Silver, hung on his left Shoulder, a Shield with 
boss and nails gilded in his left hand, in his right a Launce; besides 
this, he took his Oath before the King, that neither of his own Counsel 
or Will, but by the command of Harold he had done what he did, to the 
putting out Elfred's Eyes.  The like Oath took most of the Nobility for 
themselves, or in his behalf.  The next year147. Hardecnute sending his 
House-carles, so they call'd his Officers, to gather the Tribute 
impos'd;148. two of them rigorous in their Office, were slain at 
Worcester by the People; wherat the King enrag'd sent Leofric Duke of 
Mercia, and Seward of Northumberland, with great Forces and Commission 
to slay the Citizens, rifle and burn the City, and waste the whole 
Province.  Affrighted with such news, all the People fled: the 
Countrymen whither they could, the Citizens to a small Island in Severn, 
call'd Beverege, which they fortified and defended stoutly till Peace 
was granted them, and freely to return home.  But their City they found 
sack'd and burnt; wherwith the King was appeas'd.  This was commendable 
in him, however cruel to others, that towards his half Brethren, though 
Rivals of his Crown, he shew'd himself always tenderly affection'd; as 
now towards Edward, who without fear came to him out of Normandy,  and 
with unfeign'd kindness receiv'd, remain'd safely and honourably in his 
Court.  But Hardecnute the year following,149. at a Feast wherin Osgod a 
great Danish Lord gave his Daughter in marriage at Lamberth, to Prudon 
another potent Dane, in the midst of his Mirth, sound and healthful to 
sight, while he was drinking fell down speechless, and so dying, was 
buried at Winchester beside his Father.150.  He was it seems a great 
lover of good cheer; sitting at Table four times a day, with great 
Variety of Dishes and superfluity to all Comers.  Wheras, saith 
Huntingdon, in our time Princes in their Houses made but one meal a day.  
He gave his Sister Gunildis, a Virgin of rare Beauty, in marriage to 
Henry the Alman Emperor; and to send her forth pompously, all the 
Nobility contributed their Jewels and richest Ornaments.  But it may 
seem a wonder that our Historians, if they deserve that name, should in 
a matter so remarkable, and so near their own time, so much differ.  
Huntingdon relates, against the credit of all other records, that 
Hardecnute thus dead, the English rejoicing at this unexpected riddance 
of the Danish Yoke, sent over to Elfred the elder Son of Emma by King 
Ethelred, of whom we heard but now, that he died a Prisoner at Ely, sent 
thither by Harold six year before; that he came now out of Normandy, 
with a great number of men, to receive the Crown; that Earl Godwin 
aiming to have his Daughter Queen of England, by marrying her to Edward 
a simple Youth, for he thought Elfred of a higher Spirit then to accept 
her, persuaded the Nobles that Elfred had brought over too many Normans, 
had promis'd them Land here, that it was not safe to suffer a warlike 
and subtile Nation to take root in the Land, that these were to be so 
handled as none of them might dare for the future to flock hither, upon 
pretence of relation to the King: therupon by common consent of the 
Nobles, both Elfred and his Company were dealt with as was above 
related; that they then sent for Edward out of Normandy, with Hostages 
to be left there of their faithful intentions to make him King, and 
their desires not to bring over with him many Normans; that Edward at 
their call came then first out of Normandy; wheras all others agree that 
he came voluntarily over to visit Hardecnute, as is before said, and was 
remaining then in Court at the time of his Death.  For Hardecnute dead, 
saith Malmsbury, Edward doubting greatly his own safety, determin'd to 
rely wholly on the advice and favour of Earl Godwin; desiring therfore 
by Messengers to have private speech with him, the Earl a while 
deliberated: at last assenting, Prince Edward came, and would have 
fallen at his feet; but that not permitted, told him the danger wherin 
he thought himself at present, and in great perplexity besought his help 
to convey him some whither out of the Land.  Godwin soon apprehending 
the fair occasion that now as it were prompted him how to advance 
himself and his Family, cheerfully exhorted him to remember himself the 
Son of Ethelred, the Grandchild of Edgar, right Heir to the Crown, at 
full Age; not to think of flying, but of reigning, which might easily be 
brought about if he would follow his Counsel; then setting forth the 
Power and Authority which he had in England, promis'd it should be all 
his to set him on the Throne, of he on his part would promise and swear 
to be for ever his Friend, to preserve the honour of his House, and to 
marry his Daughter.  Edward, as his necessity then was, consented 
easily, and swore to whatever Godwin requir'd.  An Assembly of States 
therupon met at Gillingham, where Edward pleaded his Right; and by the 
powerful influence of Godwin was accepted.  Others, as Brompton, with no 
probability write, that Godwin at this time was fled into Denmark, for 
what he had done to Elfred, return'd and submitted himself to Edward 
then King, was by him charg'd openly with the Death of Elfred, and not 
without much ado, by the intercession of Leofric and other Peers, 
receiv'd at length into favour.

EDWARD the Confessor.

Glad were the English deliver'd so unexpectedly from their Danish 
Masters, and little thought how near another Conquest was hanging over 
them.  Edward, the Easter following,151. crown'd at Winchester,152. the 
same year accompanied with Earl Godwin, Leofric and Siward, came again 
thither on a sudden, and by their Counsel seiz'd on the Treasure of his 
Mother Emma.  The cause alledg'd is, that she was hard to him in the 
time of his Banishment; and indeed she is said not much to have lov'd 
Ethelred her former Husband, and therafter the Children by him; she was 
moreover noted to be very covetous, hard to the Poor, and profuse to 
Monasteries.153.  About this time also King Edward, according to 
promise, took to wife Edith, or Egith Earl Godwin's Daughter, commended 
much for beauty, modesty, and, beyond what is requisite in a Woman, 
Learning.  Ingulf then a youth lodging in the Court with his Father, saw 
her oft, and coming from the School, was sometimes met by her and pos'd, 
not in Grammar only, but in Logic.  Edward the next year but one,154. 
made ready a strong Navy at Sandwich against Magnus King of Norway,155. 
who threaten'd an Invasion, had not Swane King of Denmark diverted him 
by a War at home to defend his own Land,156. not out of good Will to 
Edward, as may be suppos'd,157. who at the same time express'd none to 
the Danes, banishing Gunildis the Neice of Canute with her two Sons, and 
Osgod by surname Clapa, out of the Realm.  Swane overpower'd by Magnus 
sent the next year158. to entreat aid of King Edward;159. Godwin gave 
Counsel to send him 50 Ships fraught with Soldiers; but Leofric and the 
general voice gainsaying, none were sent.  The next year160.Harold 
Harvager King of Norway sending Embassadors, made peace with King 
Edward;161. but an Earthquake at Worcester and Derby, Pestilence and 
Famine in many places, much lessen'd the enjoyment therof.  The next 
year162. Henry the Emperor displeas'd with Baldwin Earl of Flanders, had 
straiten'd him with a great Army by Land;163. and sending to King 
Edward, desir'd him with his Ships to hinder what he might, his escape 
by Sea.  The King therfore with a great Navy coming to Sandwich, there 
staid till the Emperor came to an agreement with Earl Baldwin.  Mean 
while Swane Son of Earl Godwin, who not permitted to marry Edgiva the 
Abbess of Chester by him deflour'd, had left the Land, came out of 
Denmark with 8 Ships, feigning a desire to return into the King's 
favour; and Beorn his Cousin German, who commanded part of the King's 
Navy, promis'd to intercede that his Earldon might be restor'd him.  
Godwin therfore and Beorn with a few Ships, the rest of the Fleet gone 
home, coming to Pevensey (but Godwin soon departing thence in pursuit of 
29 Danish ships who had got much Booty on the Coast of Essex, and 
perish'd by Tempest in their return) Swane with his Ships comes to Beorn 
at Pevensey, guilefully requests him to sail with him to Sandwich, and 
reconcile him to the King, as he had promis'd.  Beorn mistrusting no 
evil where he intended good, went with him in his ship attended by three 
only of his Servants: but Swane, set upon barbarous Cruelty, not 
reconciliation with the King, took Beorn now in his power and bound him; 
then coming to Dartmouth, slew and buried him in a deep Ditch.  After 
which the men of Hastings took six of his Ships, and brought them to the 
King at Sandwich; with the other two he escap'd into Flanders, there 
remaining till Aldred Bishop of Worcester by earnest mediation wrought 
his Peace with the King.  About this time King Edward sent to Pope 
Leo,164. desiring absolution from a Vow which he had made in his younger 
years, to take a journey to Rome, if God vouchsaf'd him to reign in 
England; the Pope dispens'd with his Vow, but not without the expence of 
his Journey given to the Poor, and a Monastery built or re-edify'd to 
St. Peter; who in a Vision to a Monk, as is said, chose Westminster, 
which King Edward therupon rebuilding endow'd with large Privileges and 
Revenues.  The same year, saith Florent of Worcester, certain Irish 
Pirates with 36 Ships enter'd the mouth of Severn, and with the aid of 
Griffin Prince of South-Wales, did some hurt in those parts: then 
passing the River Wye, burnt Dunedham, and slew all the Inhabitants they 
found.  Against whom Aldred Bishop of Worcester, with a few out of 
Glocester and Herefordshire, went out in haste: but Griffin to whom the 
Welch and Irish had privily sent Messengers, came down upon the English 
with his whole Power, by night, and early in the Morning suddenly 
assaulting them, slew many, and put the rest to flight.  The next year 
but one,165. King Edward remitted the Danish Tax which had continu'd 38 
years heavy upon the Land since Ethelred first paid it to the Danes,166. 
and what remain'd therof in his Treasury he sent back to the Owners:167. 
but through imprudence laid the foundation of a far worse mischief to 
the English; while studying gratitude to those Normans, who to him in 
exile had been helpful, he call'd them over to public Offices here, whom 
better he might have repaid out of his private Purse; by this means 
exasperating either nation one against the other, and making way by 
degrees to the Norman Conquest.  Robert a Monk of that Country, who had 
been serviceable to him there in time of need, he made Bishop, first of 
London, then of Canterbury; William his Chaplain Bishop of Dorchester.  
Then began the English to lay aside their own ancient Customs, and in 
many things to imitate French manners, the great Peers to speak French 
in their Houses, in French to write their Bills and Letters, as a great 
piece of Gentility, asham'd of their own: a presage of their subjection 
shortly to that People, whose Fashions and Language they affected so 
slavishly.  But that which gave beginning to many Troubles ensuing, 
happen'd this Year, and upon this occasion.168.  Eustace Earl of 
Boloign, Father of the famous Godfrey who won Jerusalem from the 
Saracens, and Husband to Goda the King's Sister, having been to visit 
King Edward, and returning by Canterbury to take ship at Dover, one of 
his Harbingers insolently seeking to lodge by force in a House there, 
provok'd so the Master therof, as by chance or heat of Anger to kill 
him.  The Count with his whole Train going to the House where his 
Servant had bin kill'd slew both the slayer and eighteen more who 
defended him.  But the Townsmen running to Arms, requited him with the 
slaughter of twenty more of his Servants, wounded most of the rest; he 
himself with one or two hardly escaping, ran back with clamour to the 
King; whom seconded by other Norman Courtiers, he stirr'd up to great 
Anger against the Citizens of Canterbury.  Earl Godwin in haste is sent 
for, the Cause related and much aggravated by the King against that 
City, the Earl commanded to raise Forces, and use the Citizens therof as 
Enemies.  Godwin sorry to see Strangers more favour'd of the King then 
his native People, answer'd, that it were better to summon first the 
chief men of the Town into the King's Court, to charge them with 
Sedition, where both Parties might be heard, that not found in fault 
they might be aquitted; if otherwise, by Fine or loss of Life might 
satisfy the King whose Peace they had broken, and the Count whom they 
had injur'd; till this were done refusing to prosecute with hostile 
Punishment them of his own County unheard, whom his Office was rather to 
defend.  The King displeas'd with his Refusal, and not knowing how to 
compel him, appointed an Assembly of all the Peers to be held at 
Glocester, where the matter might be fully try'd; the Assembly was full 
and frequent according to Summons: but Godwin mistrusting his own Cause, 
or the Violence of his Adversaries, with his two Sons, Swane and Harold, 
and a great Power gather'd out of his own and his Son's Earldoms, which 
contain'd most of the South-East and West Parts of England, came no 
further then Beverstan, giving out that their Forces were to go against 
the Welch, who intended an Irruption into Herefordshire; and Swane under 
that pretence lay with part of his Army therabout.  The Welch 
understanding this device, and with all diligence clearing themselves 
before the King, left Godwin detected of false Accusation in great 
hatred to all the Assembly.  Leofric therfore and Siward, Dukes of great 
Power, the former in Mercia, the other in all parts beyond Humber, both 
ever faithful to the King, send privily with speed to raise the Forces 
of their Provinces.  Which Godwin not knowing, sent boldly to King 
Edward, demanding Count Eustace and his Followers together with those 
Boloignians, who, as Simeon writes, held a Castle in the Jurisdiction of 
Canterbury.  The King, as then having but little Force at hand, 
entertain'd him a while with Treaties and Delays, till his summon'd Army 
drew nigh, then rejected his Demands.  Godwin thus match'd, commanded 
his Sons not to begin Fight against the King; begun with, not to give 
ground.  The King's Forces were the Flower of those Counties whence they 
came, and eager to fall on:169. But Leofric and the wiser sort detesting 
Civil War, brought the Matter to this accord, that Hostages given on 
either side, the whole Cause should be again debated at London.  Thither 
the King and Lords coming with their Army, sent to Godwin and his Sons 
(who with their Powers were come as far as Southwark ) commanding their 
appearance unarm'd with only 12 Attendants, and that the rest of their 
Soldiers they should deliver over to the King.  They to appear without 
Pledges before an adverse Faction deny'd; but to dismiss their Soldiers 
refus'd not, nor in aught else to obey the King as far as might stand 
with Honour, and the just regard of their Safety.  This Answer not 
pleasing the King, an Edict was presently issu'd forth, that Godwin and 
his Sons within five days depart the Land.  He who perceiv'd now his 
Numbers to diminish, readily obey'd, and with his Wife and three Sons, 
Tosti, Swane, and Gyrtha, with as much Treasure as their Ship could 
carry, embarking at Thorney, sail'd into Flanders to Earl Baldwin, whose 
Daughter Judith, Tosti had married: for Wulnod his fourth Son was then 
Hostage to the King in Normandy; his other two, Harold and Leofwin, 
taking ship at Bristow, in a Vessel that lay ready there belonging to 
Swane, pass'd into Ireland.  King Edward pursuing his Displeasure, 
divorc'd his Wife Edith Earl Godwin's Daughter, sending her despoil'd of 
all her Ornaments to Warewel with one Waiting-Maid, to be kept in 
custody by his Sister the Abbess there.170.   His reason of so doing was 
as harsh as his Act, that she only, while her nearest Relations were in 
Banishment, might not, though innocent, enjoy ease at home.  After this, 
William Duke of Normandy with a great number of Followers coming into 
England, was by King Edward honourably entertain'd, and led about the 
Cities and Castles, as it were to shew him what ere long was to be his 
own, (though at that time, saith Ingulf, no mention therof pass'd 
between them) then after some time of his Abode here, presented richly 
and dismiss'd, he return'd home.  The next Year Queen Emma died,171. and 
was buried at Winchester.172.  The Chronicle atttributed to John 
Brompton a Yorkshire Abbot, but rather of some nameless Author living 
under Edward III. or later, reports that the Year before, by Robert the 
Archbishop she was accus'd both of consenting to the Death of her Son 
Alfred, and of preparing Poison for Edward also; lastly of too much 
Familiarity with Alwin Bishop of Winchester: that to approve her 
Innocence, praying over-night to St. Swithune, she offer'd to pass 
blindfold between certain Plowshares red-hot, according to the Ordalian 
Law, which without harm she perform'd; that the King therupon receiv'd 
her to Honour, and from her and the Bishop, Penance for his Credulity; 
that the Archbishop asham'd of his Accusation fled out of England: which 
besides the silence of antienter Authors (for the Bishop fled not till a 
Year after) brings the whole story into suspicion, in this more 
probable, if it can be prov'd, that in memory of this Deliverance from 
the nine burning Plowshares, Queen Emma gave to the Abbey of St. 
Swithune nine Mannors, and Bishop Alwin other nine.  About this time 
Griffin Prince of South-Wales wasted Herefordshire; to oppose whom the 
People of that Country, with many Normans, garrison'd in the Castle of 
Hereford, went out in Arms, but were put to the worse, many slain, and 
much Booty driven away by the Welch.  Soon after which Harold and 
Leofwin, Sons of Godwin, coming into Severn with many Ships, in the 
Confines of Somerset and Devonshire, slew in a Fight more then 30 of 
their principal Men, many of the common sort, and return'd with much 
Booty to their Fleet.173.  King Edward on the other side made ready 
above 60 Ships at Sandwich well stor'd with Men and Provision, under the 
conduct of Odo and Radulf two of his Norman Kindred, enjoining them to 
find out Godwin, whom he heard to be at Sea.  To quicken them, he 
himself lay on shipboard, oft-times watch'd and sail'd up and down in 
search of those Pirates.  But Godwin, whether in a Mist or by other 
Accident, passing by them, arriv'd in another part of Kent, and 
dispersing secret Messengers abroad, by fair Words allur'd the chief men 
of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Essex, to his Party; which News coming to 
the King's Fleet at Sandwich, they hasted to find him out; but missing 
of him again, came up without effect to London.  Godwin advertis'd of 
this, forthwith sail'd to the Isle of Wight; where at length his two 
Sons Harold and Leofwin finding him, with their united Navy lay on the 
Coast, forbearing other Hostility then to furnish themselves with fresh 
Victuals from Land as they needed.  Thence as one Fleet they set forward 
to Sandwich, using all fair means by the way to encrease their Numbers 
both of Mariners and Soldiers.  The King then at London, startled at 
these Tidings, gave speedy order to raise Forces in all parts which had 
not revolted from him; but now too late, for Godwin within a few days 
after with his Ships or Galleys came up the River Thames to Southwark, 
and till the Tide return'd had Conference with the Londoners; whom by 
fair Speeches, for he was held a good Speaker in those times, he brought 
to his bent.  The tide returning, and none upon the Bridge hindering, he 
row'd up in his Galleys along the South Bank; where his Land-Army, now 
come to him, in array of Battel stood on the shore; then turning toward 
the North-side of the river, where the King's Galleys lay in some 
readiness, and Land-forces also not far off, he made shew as offering to 
fight; but they understood one another, and the Soldiers on either side 
soon declar'd their Resolution not to fight English against English.  
Thence coming to Treaty, the King and the Earl reconcil'd, both Armies 
were dissolv'd, Godwin and his Sons restor'd to their former Dignities, 
except Swane, who touch'd in Conscience for the slaughter of Beorn his 
Kinsman, was gone barefoot to Jerusalem, and returning home, died by 
Sickness or Saracens in Lycia; his Wife Edith, Godwin's Daughter, King 
Edward took to him again, dignify'd as before.  Then were the Normans, 
who had done many unjust things under the King's Authority, and given 
him ill Counsel against his People, banish'd the Realm; some of them not 
blameable, permitted to stay.  Robert Archbishop of Canterbury, William 
of London, Ulf of Lincoln, all Normans, hardly escaping with their 
Followers, got to Sea.  The Archbishop went with his Complaint to Rome; 
but returning, died in Normandy at the same Monastery from whence he 
came.  Osbern and Hugh surrender'd their Castles, and by permission of 
Leofric pass'd through his Counties with their Normans to Macbeth King 
of Scotland.  The year following174. Rhese Brother to Griffin, Prince of 
South-Wales, who by Inroads had done much damage to the English, taken 
at Bulendun, was put to death by the King's appointment,175. and his 
Head brought to him at Glocester.  The same year at Winchester, on the 
second holy-day of Easter, Earl Godwin sitting with the King at Table, 
sunk down suddenly in his Seat as dead: his three Sons Harold, Tosti, 
and Girtha, forthwith carried him into the King's Chamber, hoping he 
might revive: but the Malady had so seiz'd him, that the fifth day after 
he expir'd.  The Normans who hated Godwin give out, saith Malmsbury, 
that mention happening  to be made of Elfred, and the King therat 
looking sourly upon Godwin, he to vindicate himself, utter'd these 
words, Thou, O King, at every mention made of thy Brother Elfred, 
look'st frowningly upon me; but let God not suffer me to swallow this 
Morsel, if I be guilty of aught done against his Life or thy Advantage; 
that after these words, choak'd with the Morsel taken, he sunk down and 
recover'd not.  His first Wife was the Sister of Canute, a Woman of much 
Infamy for the Trade she drove of buying up English Youths and Maids to 
sell in Denmark, wherof she made great gain; but ere long was struck 
with Thunder, and died.  The year ensuing,176. Siward Earl of 
Northumberland, with a great number of Horse and Foot, attended also by 
a strong Fleet at the King's appointment, made an Expedition into 
Scotland,177. vanquish'd the Tyrant Macbeth, slaying many thousands of 
Scots with those Normans that went thither, and plac'd Malcolm Son of 
the Cumbrian King in his stead; yet not without loss of his own Son, and 
many other both English and Danes.  Told of his Son's Death, he ask'd 
whether he receiv'd his Death's Wound before or behind?178. when it was 
answer'd, before; I am glad, saith he; and should not else have thought 
him, though my Son, worthy of Burial.  In the mean while King Edward 
being without Issue to succeed him, sent Aldred Bishop of Winchester 
with great Presents to the Emperor, entreating him to prevail with the 
King of Hungary, that Edward the remaining Son of his Brother Edmund 
Ironside might be sent into England.  Siward but one year surviving his 
great Victory,179. died at York;180. reported by Huntingdon a Man of 
Giant-like Stature; and by his own Demeanour at point of Death 
manifested, of a rough and meer soldierly Mind.  For much disdaining to 
die in bed by a Disease, not in the Field fighting with his Enemies, he 
caus'd himself compleatly arm'd, and weapon'd with Battel-ax and Shield 
to be set in a Chair, whether to fight with Death, if he could be so 
vain, or to meet him (when far other Weapons and Preparations were 
needful) in a martial Bravery; but true Fortitude glories not in the 
feats of War, as they are such, but as they serve to end War soonest by 
a victorious Peace.  His Earldom the King bestow'd on Tosti the Son of 
Earl Godwin: and soon after in a Convention held at London, banish'd 
without visible cause, Huntingdon saith for Treason, Algar the Son of 
Leofric, who passing into Ireland, soon return'd with eighteen Ships to 
Griffin Prince of South-Wales, requesting his Aid against King Edward.  
He assembling his Power, enter'd with him into Herefordshire; whom 
Radulf a timorous Captain, Son to the King's Sister, not by Eustace, but 
a former Husband, met two Miles distant from Hereford; and having hors'd 
the English who knew better to fight on foot, without stroke he with his 
French and Normans beginning to fly, taught the English by his Example.  
Griffin and Algar following the Chase, slew many, wounded more, enter'd 
Hereford, slew seven Canons defending the Minster, burnt the Monastery 
and Reliques, then the City; killing some, leading captive others of the 
Citizens, return'd with great Spoils; wherof King Edward having notice, 
gather'd a great Army at Glocester under the Conduct of Harold now Earl 
of Kent, who strenuously pursuing Griffin enter'd Wales, and encamp'd 
beyond Straddale.  But the Enemy flying before him farther into the 
Country, leaving there the greater part of his Army with such as had 
charge to fight, if occasion offer'd, with the rest he return'd, and 
fortify'd Hereford with a Wall and Gates.  Mean while Griffin and Algar 
dreading the Diligence of Harold, after many Messages to and fro, 
concluded a Peace with him.  Algar discharging his Fleet with Pay at 
West-Chester, came to the King, and was restor'd to his Earldom.  But 
Griffin with breach of Faith, the next year181. set upon Leofgar the 
Bishop of Hereford and his Clerks then at a place call'd Glastbrig, with 
Agelnoth Vicount of the Shire, and slew them;182. but Leofric, Harold 
and King Edward, by force, as is likeliest, though it be not said how, 
reduc'd him to Peace.  The next year183. Edward Son of Edmund Ironside, 
for whom his Uncle King Edward had sent to the Emperor, came out of 
Hungary, design'd Successor to the Crown;184. but within a few days 
after his coming died at London, leaving behind him Edgar Atheling his 
Son, Margaret and Christiana his Daughters.  About the same time also 
died Earl Leofric in a good old Age, a Man of no less Vertue then Power 
in his time, religious, prudent and faithful to his Country, happily 
wedded to Godiva, a Woman of great Praise.  His Son Algar found less 
favour with King Edward, again banish'd the Year after his Father's 
Death;185. but he again by the Aid of Griffin and a Fleet from Norway, 
maugre the King, soon recover'd his Earldom.186.  The next year187. 
Malcolm King of Scots coming to visit King Edward,188. was brought on 
his way by Tosti the Northumbrian Earl, to whom he swore Brotherhood: 
yet the next year but one,189. while Tosti was gone to Rome with Aldred 
Archbishop of York for his Pall,190. this sworn Brother taking advantage 
of his Absence, roughly harass'd Northumberland.  The year passing to an 
end without other matter of moment, save the frequent Inroads and 
Robberies of Griffin, whom no Bonds of Faith could restrain, King Edward 
sent against him after Christmas, Harold now Duke of West-Saxons, with 
no great body of Horse, from Glocester, where he then kept his Court; 
whose coming heard of, Griffin not daring to abide, nor in any part of 
his Land holding himself secure, escap'd hardly by Sea, ere Harold 
coming to Rudeland, burnt his Palace and Ships there, returning to 
Glocester the same day.  But by the middle of May191. setting out with a 
Fleet from Bristow,192. he sail'd about the most part of Wales, and met 
by his Brother Tosti with many Troops of Horse, as the King had 
appointed, began to waste the Country; but the Welch giving Pledges, 
yielded themselves, promised to become tributary, and banish Griffin 
their Prince; who lurking somewhere, was the next year193. taken and 
slain by Griffin Prince of North-Wales;194. his Head with the Head and 
Tackle of his Ship sent to Harold, by him to the King, who of his 
Gentleness made Blechgent and Rithwallon or Rivallon his two Brothers 
Princes in his stead; they to Harold in behalf of the King swore Fealty 
and Tribute.  Yet the next Year195. Harold having built a fair House at 
a place call'd Portascith in Monmouthshire,196. and stor'd it with 
Provision, that the King might lodge there in time of hunting,197. 
Caradoc the Son of Griffin slain the year before, came with a number of 
Men, slew all he found there, and took away the Provision.  Soon after 
which the Northumbrians in a Tumult at York beset the Palace of Tosti 
their Earl, slew more then 200 of his Soldiers and Servants, pillag'd 
his Treasure, and put him to fly for his Life.  The cause of this 
Insurrection they alledg'd to be, for that the Queen Edith had 
commanded, in her Brother Tosti's behalf, Gospatric a Noble-man of that 
Country to be treacherously slain in the King's Court; and that Tosti 
himself the year before with like Treachery had caus'd to be slain in 
his Chamber Gamel and Ulf, two other of their Noble-men, besides his 
intolerable Exactions and Oppressions.  Then in a manner the whole 
Country coming up to complain of their Grievances, met with Harold at 
Northampton, whom the King at Tosti's Request had sent to pacify the 
Northumbrians; but they laying open the Cruelty of his Government, and 
their own Birth-right of Freedom not to endure the tyranny of any 
Governour whatsoever, with absolute Refusal to admit him again, and 
Harold hearing Reason, all the Accomplices of Tosti were expell'd the 
Earldom.  He himself banish'd the Realm, went into Flanders; Morcar the 
Son of Algar made Earl in his stead.  Huntingdon tells another cause of 
Tosti's Banishment, that one day at Windsor, while Harold reach'd the 
Cup to King Edward, Tosti envying to see his younger Brother in greater 
favour then himself, could not forbear to run furiously upon him, 
catching hold of his Hair; the scuffle was soon parted by other 
Attendants rushing between, and Tosti forbidden the Court.  He with 
continu'd fury riding to Hereford, where Harold had many Servants, 
preparing an Entertainment for the King, came to the House and set upon 
them with his Followers; then lopping off Hands, Arms, Legs of some, 
Heads of others, threw them into Butts of Wine, Meath, or Ale, which 
were laid in for the King's drinking: and at his going away charg'd them 
to send him this word, that of other fresh Meats he might bring with him 
to his Farm what he pleas'd, but of Sous he should find plenty provided 
ready for him: that for this barbarous Act the King pronounc'd him 
banish'd; that the Northumbrians taking advantage at the King's 
displeasure and Sentence against him, rose also to be reveng'd of his 
Cruelties done to themselves.  But this no way agrees, for why then 
should Harold or the King so much labour with the Northumbrians to re-
admit him, if he were a banish'd Man for his Crimes done before?  About 
this time it happen'd that Harold putting to Sea one day for his 
pleasure,198. in a Fisher-Boat, from his Mannor at Boseham in Sussex, 
caught with a Tempest too far off Land, was carried into Normandy; and 
by the Earl of Pontiew, on whose Coast he was driven, at his own request 
brought to Duke William; who entertaining him with great courtesy, so 
far won him, as to promise the Duke by Oath of his own accord, not only 
the Castle of Dover then in his tenure, but the Kingdom also after King 
Edward's Death to his utmost endeavour, therupon betrothing the Duke's 
Daughter then too young for marriage, and departing richly presented.  
Others say, that King Edward himself after the Death of Edward his 
Nephew, sent Harold thither on purpose to acquaint Duke William with his 
intention to bequeath him his Kingdom:199. but Malmsbury accounts the 
former story to be the truer.200.  Ingulf writes,201. that King Edward 
now grown old, and perceiving Edgar his Nephew both in Body and Mind 
unfit to govern, especially against the Pride and Insolence of Godwin's 
Sons, who would never obey him; Duke William on the other side of high 
Merit, and his Kinsman by the Mother, had sent Robert Archbishop of 
Canterbury, to acquaint the Duke with his purpose, not long before 
Harold came thither.  The former part may be true, that King Edward upon 
such Considerations had sent one or other; but Archbishop Robert was 
fled the Land, and dead may years before.  Eadmer and Simeon write, that 
Harold went of his own accord into Normandy, by the King's Permission or 
Connivance, to get free his Brother Wulnod and Nephew Hacun the Son of 
Swane, whom the King had taken Hostages of Godwin, and sent into 
Normandy; that King Edward foretold Harold, his Journey thither would be 
to the detriment of all England and his own Reproach; that Duke William 
then acquainted Harold, how Edward ere his coming to the Crown had 
promis'd, if ever he attain'd it, to leave Duke William Successor after 
him.  Last of these Matthew Paris writes, that Harold to get free of 
Duke William, affirm'd his coming thither not to have been by accident 
or force of Tempest, but on set purpose, in that private manner to enter 
with him into secret Confederacy: so variously are these things 
reported.  After this King Edward grew sickly,202. yet as he was able 
kept his Christmas at London, and was at the Dedication of St. Peter's 
Church in Westminster, which he had rebuilt;203. but on the Eve of 
Epiphany, or Twelf-tide, deceas'd much lamented, and in the Church was 
entomb'd.  That he was harmless and simple, is conjectur'd by his words 
in anger to a Peasant who had cross'd his Game (for with hunting and 
hawking he was much delighted) by God and God's Mother, said he, I shall 
do you as shrewd a turn if I can; observing that Law-Maxim, the best of 
all his Successors, That the King of England can do no wrong.  The 
softness of his Nature gave growth to Factions of those about him, 
Normans especially and English; these complaining that Robert the 
Archbishop was a sower of Dissension between the King and his People, a 
Traducer of the English; the other side, that Godwin and his Sons bore 
themselves arrogantly and proudly towards the King, usurping to 
themselves equal share in the Government; oft-times making sport with 
his simplicity,204. that through their Power in the Land, they made no 
scruple to kill Men of whose Inheritance they took a liking, and so to 
take possession.  The truth is, that Godwin and his Sons did many things 
boistrously and violently, much against the King's mind; which not able 
to resist, he had, as some say, his Wife Edith Godwin's Daughter in such 
aversation, as in bed never to have touch'd her; whether for this cause 
or mistaken Chastity, not commendable; to enquire further, is not 
material.  His Laws held good and just, and long after desir'd by the 
English of their Norman Kings, are yet extant.  He is said to be at 
Table not excessive, at Festivals nothing puft up with the costly Robes 
he wore, which his Queen with curious Art had woven for him in Gold.  He 
was full of Alms-deeds, and exhorted the Monks to like Charity.  He is 
said to be the first English King that cur'd the Disease call'd thence 
the King's Evil; yet Malmsbury blames them who attribute that Cure to 
his Royalty, not to his Sanctity; said also to have cur'd certain blind 
Men with the Water wherin he hath wash'd his hands.  A little before his 
Death, lying speechless two days, the third day after a deep sleep, he 
was heard to pray, that if it were a true Vision, not an Illusion which 
he had seen, God would give him strength to utter it, otherwise not.  
Then he related how he had seen two devout Monks, whom he knew in 
Normandy, to have lived and died well, who appearing told him they were 
sent Messengers from God to foretel, that because the Great-ones of 
England, Dukes, Lords, Bishops, and Abbots, were not Ministers of God, 
but of the Devil, God had deliver'd the Land to their Enemies; and when 
he desir'd that he might reveal this Vision, to the end they might 
repent, it was answer'd, they neither will repent, neither will God 
pardon them: at this relation others trembling, Stigand the Simonious 
Archbishop, whom Edward much to blame had suffer'd many years to sit 
Primate in the Church, is said to have laugh'd, as at the feverish Dream 
of a doting old Man; but the Event prov'd it true.

HAROLD Son of Earl Godwin.

Harold, whether by King Edward  a little before his Death ordain'd 
Successor to the Crown, as Simeon of Durham, and others affirm;205. or 
by the prevalence of his Faction,206. excluding Edgar the right Heir, 
Grandchild to Edmund Ironside, as Malsmbury and Huntingdon agree, no 
sooner was the Funeral of King Edward ended, but on the same day was 
elected and crown'd King: and no sooner plac'd in the Throne, but began 
to frame himself by all manner of Compliances to gain Affection, 
endeavour'd to make good Laws, repeal'd bad, became a great Patron to 
Church and Church-men, courteous and affable to all reputed good, a 
hater of evil-doers, charg'd all his Officers to punish Thieves, 
Robbers, and all disturbers of the Peace, while he himself by Sea and 
Land labour'd in the defence of his Country: so good an Actor is 
Ambition.  In the mean while a blazing Star, seven mornings together, 
about the end of April was seen to stream terribly, not only over 
England, but other parts of the World; foretelling here, as was thought, 
the great Changes approaching: plainliest prognosticated by Elmer a Monk 
of Malmsbury, who could not foresee, when time was, the breaking of his 
own Legs for soaring too high.  He in his youth strangely aspiring, had 
made and fitted wings to his Hands and Feet; with these on the top of a 
Tower, spread out to gather Air, he flew more then a Furlong; but the 
Wind being too high, came fluttering down, to the maining of all his 
Limbs; yet so conceited of his Art, that he attributed the cause of his 
fall to the want of a Tail, as Birds have, which he forgot to make to 
his hinder parts.  This story, though seeming otherwise too light in the 
midst of a sad Narration, yet for the strangeness therof, I thought 
worthy enough the placing as I found it plac'd in my Author.  But to 
digress no farther: Tosti the King's Brother coming from Flanders, full 
of Envy at his younger Brother's advancement to the Crown, resolv'd what 
he might to trouble his Reign; forcing therfore them of Wight Isle to 
Contribution, he sail'd thence to Sandwich, committing Piracies on the 
Coast between.  Harold then residing at London, with a great number of 
Ships drawn together, and of Horse Troops by Land, prepares in Person 
for Sandwich: wherof Tosti having notice, directs his course with 60 
Ships towards Lindsey,207. taking with him all the Seamen he found 
willing or unwilling: where he burnt many Villages, and slew many of the 
Inhabitants; but Edwin the Mercian Duke, and Morcar his Brother, the 
Northumbrian Earl, with their Forces on either side, soon drove him out 
of the Country.  Who thence betook him to Malcolm the Scotish King, and 
with him abode the whole Summer.  About the same time Duke William 
sending Embassadors to admonish Harold of his Promise and Oath, to 
assist him in his Plea to the Kingdom, he made answer, that by the death 
of his Daughter betroth'd to him on that condition, he was absolv'd of 
his Oath;208. or not dead, he could not take her now an outlandish 
Woman, without consent of the Realm; that it was presumptuously done, 
and not to be persisted in, if without consent or knowledge of the 
States, he had sworn away the right of the Kingdom; that what he swore 
was to gain his Liberty, being in a manner then his Prisoner; that it 
was unreasonable in the Duke to require or expect of him the forgoing of 
a Kingdom, confer'd upon him with universal favour and acclamation of 
the People: to this flat denial he added contempt, sending the 
Messengers back, saith Matthew Paris, on maim'd Horses.  The Duke thus 
contemptuously put off, addresses himself to the Pope, setting forth the 
Justice of his cause,which Harold, whether through haughtiness of mind, 
or distrust, or that the ways and to Rome were stop'd, sought not to do.  
Duke William, besides the Promise and Oath of Harold, alledg'd that King 
Edward by the advice of Seward, Godwin himself, and Stigand the 
Archbishop, had given him the right of Succession, and had sent him the 
Son and Nephew of Godwin, pledges of the Gift; the Pope sent to Duke 
William, after this demonstration of his right, a consecrated Banner.  
Wherupon he having with great care and choice got an Army of tall and 
stout Soldiers, under Captains of great skill and mature Age, came in 
August to the Port of St. Valerie.  Mean while Harold from London comes 
to Sandwich, there expecting his Navy; which also coming, he sails to 
the Isle of Wight; and having heard of Duke William's preparations and 
readiness to invade him, kept good watch on the Coast, and Foot Forces 
every where in fit place to guard the shore.  But ere the middle of 
September, Provision failing when it was most needed, both fleet and 
Army return home.  When on a sudden, Harold Harvager King of Norway,209. 
with a Navy of more then 500 great Ships, (other lessen them by two 
hundred, others augment them to a thousand)210. appears at the mouth of 
Tine; to whom Earl Tosti with his Ships came as was agreed between them; 
whence both uniting, set sail with all speed and enter'd the River 
Humber.  Thence turning into Ouse, as far as Rical, landed, and won York 
by assault.  At these tidings Harold with all his Power hasts 
thitherward; but ere his coming, Edwin and Morcar at Fulford by York, on 
the North-side of Ouse, about the Feast of St. Matthew had given them 
Battel; successfully at first, but over-born at length with numbers; and 
forc'd to turn their backs, more of them perish'd in the River, then in 
the Fight.  The Norwegians taking with them 500 Hostages out of York, 
and leaving there 150 of their own, retir'd to their Ships.  But the 
fifth day after, King Harold with a great and well-appointed Army, 
coming to York, and at Stamford Bridge, or Battel Bridge on Darwent,211. 
assailing the Norwegians, after much bloodshed on both sides, cut off 
the greatest part of them with Harvager their King, and Tosti his own 
Brother.  But Olave the King's Son, and Paul Earl of Orkney, left with 
many Soldiers to guard the Ships, surrendring themselves with Hostages 
and Oath given never to return as Enemies, he suffer'd freely to depart 
with 20 Ships and the small remnant of their Army.212.  One man of the 
Norwegians is not to be forgotten, who with incredible valour keeping 
the Bridge a long hour against the whole English Army, with his single 
resistance delay'd their Victory; and scorning offer'd Life, till in the 
end no man daring to grapple with him, either dreaded as too strong, or 
contemn'd as one desperate, he was at length shot dead with an Arrow; 
and by his fall open'd the passage of pursuit to a compleat Victory.  
Wherwith Harold lifted up in mind, and forgetting now his former shews 
of popularity, defrauded his Soldiers their due and well deserved share 
of the Spoils.  While these things pass'd in Northumberland, Duke 
William lay still at St. Valerie; his Ships were ready, but the Wind 
serv'd not for many days; which put the Soldiery into much 
discouragement and murmur, taking this for an unlucky sign of their 
success; at last the Wind came favourable, the Duke first under sail 
awaited the rest at Anchor, till all coming forth, the whole Fleet of 
900 Ships with a prosperous gale arriv'd at Hastings.  At his going out 
of the Boat by a slip falling on his hands,213. to correct the Omen, a 
Soldier standing by said aloud, that their Duke had taken possession of 
England.  Landed, he restrain'd his Army from waste and spoil, saying 
that they ought to spare what was their own.  But these things are 
related of Alexander and C[ae]sar, and I doubt thence borrow'd by the Monks 
to inlay their Story.  The Duke for 15 days after landing kept his men 
quiet within the Camp, having taken the Castle of Hastings, or built a 
Fortress there.  Harold secure the while, and proud of his new Victory, 
thought all his Enemies now under foot: but sitting jollily at dinner, 
news is brought him, that Duke William of Normandy with a great 
multitude of Horse and Foot, Slingers and Archers, besides other choice 
Auxiliaries which he had hir'd in France, was arriv'd at Pevensey.  
Harold who had expected him all the Summer, but not so late in the year 
as now it was, for it was October, with his Forces much diminish'd after 
two sore conflicts, and the departing of many others from him 
discontented, in great haste marches to London.  Thence not tarrying for 
supplies which were on their way towards him, hurries into Sussex, (for 
he was always in haste since the day of his Coronation) and ere the 
third part of his Army could be well put in order, finds the Duke about 
9 miles from Hastings, and now drawing nigh, sent spies before him to 
survey the strength and number of his Enemies: them discover'd such, the 
Duke causing to be led about, and after well fill'd with Meat and Drink 
sent back.  They not over-wise brought word that the Duke's Army were 
most of them Priests; for they saw their Faces all over shaven; the 
English then using to let grow on their upper-lip large Mustachio's, as 
did antiently the Britains.  The King laughing answer'd, that they were 
not Priests, but valiant and hardy Soldiers.  Therfore said Girtha his 
Brother, a youth of noble courage and understanding above his Age, 
Forbear thou thy self to fight, who art obnoxious to Duke William by 
Oath, let us unsworn undergo the hazard of Battel, who may justly fight 
in the defence of our Country; thou reserv'd to fitter time, mayst 
either re-unite us flying, or revenge us dead.  The King not hearkening 
to this, lest it might seem to argue fear in him or a bad cause, with 
like resolution rejected the offers of Duke William sent to him by a 
Monk before the Battel, with this only Answer hastily deliver'd, Let God 
judge between us.  The offers were these, that Harold would either lay 
down the Scepter, or hold it of him, or try his Title with him by single 
combat in sight of both Armies, or refer it to the Pope.  These 
rejected, both sides prepar'd to fight the next morning, the English 
from singing and drinking all Night; the Normans from confession of 
their Sins, and communion of the Host.  The English were in a streight 
disadvantageous place, so that many discourag'd with their ill ordering, 
scarce having room where to stand, slipp'd away before the onset, the 
rest in close order with their Battle-Axes and Shields, made an 
impenetrable Squadron: the King himself with his Brothers on foot stood 
by the Royal Standard, wherin the figure of a man fighting was inwoven 
with Gold and precious Stones.  The Norman Foot, most Bowmen, made the 
formost Front, on either side Wings of Horse somewhat behind.  The Duke 
arming, and his Corslet given him on the wrong side, said pleasantly, 
The strength of my Dukedom will be turn'd now into a Kingdom.  Then the 
whole Army singing the Song of Rowland, the remembrance of whose 
Exploits might hearten them, imploring lastly Divine help, the Battel 
began; and was fought sorely on either side: but the main body of 
English Foot by no means would be broken, till the Duke causing his men 
to feign flight, drew them out with desire of pursuit into open 
disorder, then turn'd suddenly upon them so routed by themselves, which 
wrought their overthrow; yet so they died not unmanfully, but turning 
oft upon their Enemies, by the advantage of an upper ground, beat them 
down by heaps, and fill'd up a great Ditch with their Carcasses.  Thus 
hung the Victory wavering on either side, from the third hour of day to 
Evening; when Harold having maintain'd the Fight with unspeakable 
Courage and personal Valour, shot into the Head with an Arrow, fell at 
length, and left his Soldiers without heart longer to withstand the 
unwearied Enemy.  With Harold fell also his two Brothers, Leofwin and 
Girtha, with them greatest part of the English Nobility.  His Body lying 
dead, a Knight or Soldier wounding on the Thigh, was by the Duke 
presently turn'd out of Military Service.  Of Normans and French were 
slain no small number; the Duke himself also that day not a little 
hazarded his Person, having had three choice Horses kill'd under him.  
Victory obtain'd, and his dead carefully buried, the English also by 
permission, he sent the Body of Harold to his Mother without Ransom, 
though she offer'd very much to redeem it; which having receiv'd, she 
buried at Waltham, in a Church built there by Harold.  In the mean 
while, Edwin and Morcar, who had withdrawn themselves from Harold, 
hearing of his Death, came to London; sending Aldgith the Queen their 
Sister with all speed to West-Chester.  Aldred Archbishop of York, and 
many of the Nobles, with the Londoners would have set up Edgar the right 
Heir, and prepar'd themselves to fight for him; but Morcar and Edwin not 
liking the choice, who each of them expected to have been chosen before 
him, withdrew their Forces and return'd home.  Duke William contrary to 
his former resolution, if Florent of Worcester, and they who follow him 
say true,214. wasting, burning, and slaying all in his way, or rather, 
as saith Malsmbury, not in hostile but in regal manner, came up to 
London, met at Barcham by Edgar, with the Nobles, Bishops, Citizens, and 
at length Edwin and Morcar, who all submitted to him, gave Hostages and 
swore Fidelity, he to them promis'd peace and defence; yet permitted his 
men the while to burn and make prey.  Coming to London with all his 
Army, he was on Christmas day solemnly crown'd in the great Church at 
Westminster, by Aldred Archbishop of York, having first given his Oath 
at the Altar in presence of all the People, to defend the Church, well 
govern the People, maintain right Law, prohibit Rapine and unjust 
Judgment.  Thus the English while they agreed not about the choice of 
their native King, were constrain'd to take the Yoke of an outlandish 
Conqueror.  With what minds and by what course of Life they had fitted 
themselves for this servitude, William of Malmsbury spares not to lay 
open.  Not a few years before the Normans came, the Clergy, though in 
Edward the Confessor's days, had lost all good Literature and Religion, 
scarce able to read and understand their Latin Service: he was a miracle 
to others who knew his Grammar.  The Monks went clad in fine Stuffs, and 
made no difference what they eat; which though in it self no fault, yet 
to their Consciences was irreligious.  The great men given to gluttony 
and dissolute Life, made a prey of the common People, abusing their 
Daughters whom they had in service, then turning them off to the Stews; 
the meaner sort tipling together night and day, spent all they had in 
Drunkenness, attended with other Vices which effeminate men's minds.  
Whence it came to pass, that carried on with fury and rashness more then 
any true fortitude or skill of War, they gave to William their Conqueror 
so easy a Conquest.  Not but that some few of all sorts were much better 
among them; but such was the generality.  And as the long-suffering of 
God permits bad men to enjoy prosperous days with the good, so his 
severity oft-times exempts not good men from their share in evil times 
with the bad.

<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">If these were the Causes of such misery and thraldom to those our 
Ancestors, with what better close can be concluded, then here is fit 
season to remember this Age in the midst of her security, to fear from 
like Vices without amendment the Revolution of like Calamities?
