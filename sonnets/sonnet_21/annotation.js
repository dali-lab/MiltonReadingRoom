"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i> As many have noted, Sonnets 20 and 21 form a complementary pair of lyrics ( see <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#barbara_lewalski\" target=\"main\">Lewalski\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Life of John Milton</span></a> 354). Sonnet 20 praises Henry Lawrence and 21 praises Cyriack Skinner in tones reminiscent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial\" target=\"main\">Martial</a> and <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0025\" target=\"main\">Horace</a>. Both appear to have been written in 1655 or 1656 when the most puritanical of the major-generals advising Cromwell\'s government urged the repression of sports and recreations they regarded as unsuitable for truly reformed Christians. Richard Baxter, in a number of sermons preached and printed during these years, railed against \"needless sports\" and \"recreation\" as all one with cards, dice, drunkeness and ungodly behavior in general. He also regarded the persistence of parish sports and recreations as a dangerous throw-back to the Laudian church under Charles I:<blockquote>And now Hearers, what is your resolution? perhaps you have been enemies to Christ under the name of Christians: Will you be so still? Have you not loathed this busie diligent serving of him? and hated them that most carefully seek him, more then the vilest drunkard or blaspemer? Have not his word and service and sabbaths been a burthen to you? Have not multitudes ventured their lives against his Ordinances and Government? Nay is it not almost the common voice of the Nation in effect, <i>Give us our sports and liberty of sinning, give us our Readers, and singing-men, and drunken Preachers, give us our Holy-daies and Ceremonies, and the Customes of our fore-fathers; Away with these precise fellows, they are an eye-sore to us; these precise Preachers shall no Single illegible letter controll us, this precise Scripture shall be no Law to us</i>, and consequently this Christ shall not Rule over us.
