var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>.  At the center of Milton\'s epic lies an account of the creation of the world and all the creatures in it.    This account is largely modelled on the creation story in Genesis 1 and 2 but  departs from it in some  interesting ways.  Many classical epics contain creation accounts, but Milton doubtless believed his version, based on the Bible, both absorbed and superceded all of them.  Two  prominent creation epics  are Hesiod\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Theogony</span></a> and Ovid\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span></a>.  </p><p>Also interesting  is how Milton uses the Biblical creation narrative as the skeletal structure upon which he hangs his own creative fabric.  A cursory comparison of Genesis  1 and 2, and book 7 of <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> is enough to make the reader aware of the similarity of style and language between the two.  At times he simply quotes or lightly paraphrases the Bible and then adds  a little explanation.  However,  his broad departures from the Genesis story pose more complications.  The first most glaring difference between the two accounts is that in Genesis, God creates the world while in Milton\'s version, He commands his Son to do so, thus fully investing the Genesis account with a supercessionist Christian theme.  By having the Son shape the world, Milton also poses an important contrast between the two sons of god, one who creates (the Son) and the other who destroys (Satan).  </p><p>Genesis 1 suggests that male and female humans were created at the same time. Genesis 2 says that Adam was created first, named the animals, and then felt lonely. Recognizing that loneliness was not good (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 2</a>:18) God created a woman to remedy his loneliness.  Milton ingeniously deals with the discrepancy by allowing Raphael\'s account to concur with Genesis 1, and Adam\'s to correspond to that of Genesis 2, and by having Raphael admit that he was not present at Adam\'s creation.  He further separates the two accounts from each other by placing them in books 7 and 8, respectively.  Mary Nyquist\'s article, <a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#mary_nyquist\" target=\"main\">\"The Genesis of Gendered Subjectivity in the Divorce Tracts and Paradise Lost\"</a> is still the most important discussion of Milton\'s attempted reconciliation of Genesis 1 and 2. </p><p>          Other interesting critical treatments of this part of <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> include those by <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#philip_gallagher\" target=\"main\">Philip Gallagher</a>, <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#grant_mccolley\" target=\"main\">Grant McColley</a> and  <a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#regina_schwartz\" target=\"main\">Regina Schwartz</a>.

"nameurania":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Urania</i>.

This view of Wisdom as a character involved in Creation is related in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Proverbs+8&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Proverbs 8</a>:29.

He would have considered them \"evil dayes\" indeed, both for him and for the English people.  \"Evil tongues\" implies that Milton felt he (and the Republican cause) suffered slander. </span>",
"fitaudience":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fit audience</i>.  Explicit here is the idea that Milton targeted his epic towards a select few, probably those who in his eyes were true Christians.  Also, the political climate just then not being ripe for a regicide like Milton, he shows an awareness that he would not be widely read, at least for a time. </span>",
"bacchus":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Bacchus</i>. Also known as the Greek god <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=31049\" target=\"main\">Dionysus</a>, Bacchus was the god of wine, theater and ecstatic poetry. He was also the patron god of the poet Orpheus, and led a group of revellers known as the Bacchantes.

"race":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>his Race</i>.  \"Race\" here is probably best understood as what we would today call \"species,\" that is, humans as opposed to animals or birds or fish.  Our more modern sense of \"race\" as distinguishing between different groups of humans is based largely in a 19th-century biologism (see Kwame Anthony Appiah\'s article, \"Race\" in <a href=\"http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"main\">Lentricchia and McLaughlin, eds. <span class=\"booktitle\">Critical Terms for Literary Study</span></a>) unknown in Milton\'s time.</span>",

"wandring":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>wandring</i>.  This word often appears in the poem to imply error (<a href=\"../book_2/text.shtml#line560\" target=\"main\">2.561</a>), but here Milton must want us to understand wandering appetite as innocent, even error itself as innocent.  The only culpable action in pre-lapsarian Eden would be conscious and deliberate disobedience itself.  Following that, errors of all sorts, once innocent, become tainted with evil.  Still, the appearance of the word here is calculated to disturb a reader.  See also <a href=\"../book_12/text.shtml#wandring\" target=\"main\">12.648</a>.</span>",

"farts":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>as Nourishment to Winde</i>.

"bythee":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>by thee</i>.  Milton here departs significantly from the biblical account by making the Son the agent of Creation. </span>",
"fill":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>I am who fill</i>.  That Milton believed that creation was achieved <span lang=\"la\" class=\"mi\">ex Deo</span> instead of <span lang=\"la\" class=\"mi\">ex nihilo</span> is evident here.

Milton has Raphael interweave the two accounts in order to advance the impression that they are simply two versions of the same story.

"Mattin":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Mattin</i>.  Morning song or prayer of praise.</span>",
"foul":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Foul</i>. Since fowl already have been created on the fifth day (line 389), every modern editor I have consulted (including John Leonard) amends \"Foul\" here to \"Soul.\" <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+1&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 1</a>: 24 records the sixth day\'s creation  with the words, \"And God said, \'Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds.\'\" \"Soul living,\" the argument goes, appears to be a likely equivalent to \"living Soul\" or \"living creature.\" On the other hand, <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:55152:97\" name=\"ParadiseLost1667\" title=\"ParadiseLost1667\" target=\"main\">1667</a> has \"Fowle\" here. <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:55147:98\" id=\"ParadiseLost1674\" name=\"ParadiseLost1674\" title=\"ParadiseLost1674\" target=\"main\">1674</a> changes the spelling to \"Foul,\" and \"Foul\" persists in <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:60002:97\" id=\"ParadiseLost1678\" name=\"ParadiseLost1678\" title=\"ParadiseLost1678\" target=\"main\">1678</a>. One might argue that since the spelling was deliberately changed in 1674 to \"Foul\" (perhaps to insist on a monosyllabic pronunciation) there was ample opportunity to amend it to \"Soul\" if that was desired. So, contrary to all modern editors, I am sticking with \"Foul\" here. We already have \"living Soule\" created on day 5 (line 388), so there seems to me insufficient reason to change a word that persists in every printing from 1674 through 1678.</span>",
