This intimates but what our Saviour taught before, 
that divorce is not rashly to be made, but 
reconcilement to be persuaded and endeavord, as 
oft as the cause can have to doe with reconcilement, 
& is not under the dominion of blameless nature; 
which may have reason to depart though seldomest 
and last from charitable love, yet somtimes from 
friendly, and familiar, and somthing oftner from 
conjugal love, which requires not only moral, but 
natural causes to the making and maintayning; and 
may be warrantably excus'd to retire from the 
deception of what it justly seeks, and the ill requitals 
which unjustly it finds.  For Nature hath her <I>Zodiac</I>
also, keeps her great annual circuit over human 
things as truly as the Sun and Planets in the 
firmament; hath her <a href="" id="anomalies" class="annotBtn"><I>anomalies,</I></a> hath her <a href="" id="obliquities" class="annotBtn">obliquities</a> 
in ascensions and declinations, <a href="" id="accesses" class="annotBtn">accesses and recesses,</a> 
as blamelesly as they in heaven.  And sitting in her 
planetary Orb with two rains in each hand, one 
strait, the other loos, tempers the cours of minds 
as well as bodies to several conjunctions and 
oppositions, friendly, or unfriendly aspects, 
consenting oftest with reason, but never contrary.  
This in the effect no man of meanest reach but daily 
sees; and though to every one it appeare not in the 
cause, yet to a cleare capacity, well nurtur'd with 
good reading and observation, it cannot but be plaine 
and visible.  Other exposition therfore then hath 
bin given to former places that give light to these 
two summary verses, will not be needfull: save onely 
that these precepts are meant to <a name="intro6">those</a> maried who 
differ not in religion.<BR><IMG

	Now follows what is to be done, if the persons 
wedded be of a different faith.  The common beleef is, 
that a christian is heer commanded not to divorce, if 
the infidel please to stay, though it be but to vexe, or 
to deride, or to deduce the christian.  This doctrin 
will be the easie worke of a refutation.  The other 
opinion is, that a christian is here conditionally 
permitted to hold wedloc with a misbeleever only 
upon hopes limited by christian prudence, which 
without much difficulty shall be defended.  That this 
heer spoken by <I>Paul, not by the Lord</I> cannot be a 
command, these reasons avouch.  First the law of 
<I>Moses</I>, <a href="" id="Exod" class="annotBtn"><I>Exod</I>. 34. 16.</a> <a href="" id="Deut" class="annotBtn"><I>Deut</I>. 7. 3. 6.</a> interpreted by <I>Ezra,</I> 
and <I>Nehemiah</I> two infallible authors, commands to 
divorce an infidel not for the feare onely of a 
ceremonious defilement, but of an irreligious 
seducement, fear'd both in respect of the beleever 
himselfe, and of his children in danger to bee 
perverted by the misbeleeving parent. <a href="" id="Nehem" class="annotBtn"><I>Nehem</I>. 13. 
24. 26.</a> and <a href="" id="Peter" class="annotBtn"><I>Peter Martyr</I></a> thought this a convincing 
reason.  If therfore the legal pollution vanishing 
have abrogated the ceremony of this law, so that a 
christian may be permitted to retaine an infidel 
without uncleannes, yet the moral reason of 
divorcing stands to eternity, which neither Apostle 
nor Angel from heaven can countermand.  All that 
they reply to this, is their human warrant, that God 
will preserve us in our obedience of this command 
against the danger of seducement.  And so 
undoudtedly he will, if we understand his commands 
aright; if we turne not this evangelic permission into a 
legal, and yet illegal command;  if we turn not hope 
into bondage, the charitable and free hope of gaining 
another, into the forc't and servile temptation of 
losing our selves; but more of this beneath.  Thus 
these words of <I>Paul</I> by common doctrin made a 
command, are made a contradiction to the moral law.<BR><IMG
SRC="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">
	Secondly, not the law only, but the Gospel from 
the law, and from it selfe requires even in the same 
chapter, where divorce between them of one religion 
is so narrowly forbidd, rather then our christian love 
should come into danger of backsliding, to forsake all 
relations how neer so ever, and the wife expresly, 
with promise of a high reward, <a href="" id="Mat" class="annotBtn"><I>Mat</I>. 19.</a>  And he who 
hates not father or mother, wife, or children
hindering his christian cours, much more, if they 
despise or assault it, cannot be a Disciple, <a href="" id="Luke" class="annotBtn"><I>Luke</I> 14.</a>  
How can the Apostle then command us, to love and 
continue in that matrimony, which our Saviour bids 
us hate, and forsake?  They can as soon teach our 
faculty of respiration to contract and to dilate it selfe 
at once, to breath and to fetch breath in the same 
instant, as teach our minds how to doe such contrary 
acts as these, towards the same object, and as they 
must be done in the same moment.  For either the 
hatred of her religion, & her hatred to our religion 
will work powerfully against the love of her society, 
or the love of that will by degrees flatter out all our 
zealous hatred and forsaking and soone ensnare us to 
unchristianly compliances.<BR><IMG
SRC="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">
	Thirdly, In marriage there ought not only to be a 
civil love, but such a love as Christ loves his Church; 
but where the religion is contrary without hope of 
conversion, there can be no love, no faith, no 
peaceful society, (they of the other opinion confess 
it) nay there ought not to be, furder then in 
expectation of gaining a soul; when that ceases, we 
know God hath put enmity between the seed of 
the woman, and the seed of the Serpent.  Neither 
should <I>we love them that hate the Lord,</I> as the 
Prophet told <I>Jehosaphat.</I> <a href="" id="2Chron" class="annotBtn">2 <I>Chron</I>. 19.</a>  And this 
Apostle himselfe in another place warns us <I>that we be 
not unequally yokt with Infidels</I> <a href="" id="2Cor6" class="annotBtn">2 <I>Cor</I>. 6.</a> for that 
there can be no fellowship, no communion, no 
concord between such.  Outward commerce and civil 
intercours cannot perhaps be avoided; but true 
friendship and familiarity there can be none.  How 
vainly therfore, not to say how impiously would the 
most inward and dear alliance of mariage or 
continuance in mariage be commanded, where true 
friendship is confest impossible.  For say they, wee 
are forbidd heer to marry with an infidel, not bid to 
divorce.  But to rob the words thus of their full 
sense will not be allow'd them: it is not said, enter 
not into yoke, but <I>be not unequally yokd;</I> which 
plainly forbids the thing in present act, as well as in 
purpose; and his manifest conclusion is, not only that 
<I>we should not touch,</I> but that having toucht, <I>we 
should come out from among them, and be separat</I>; 
with the promise of a blessing thereupon that <I>God will 
receave us, will be our father, and we his sons and 
daughters.</I> <a href="" id="2Cor6" class="annotBtn">v. 17. 18.</a>  Why we should stay with an 
Infidel after the expence of all our hopes, can be but 
for a civil relation; but why we should depart from a 
seducer, setting aside the misconstruction of this 
place, is from a religious necessity of departing.  The 
wors cause therfore of staying (if it be any cause at 
all, for civil government forces it not) must not 
overtop the religious cause of separating, executed 
with such an urgent zeal, & such a prostrate 
humiliation by <I>Ezra</I> and <I>Nehemiah</I>.  What God hates 
to joyn, certainly he cannot love should continue 
joyn'd: it being all one in matter of ill consequence, to 
marry, or to continue maried with an Infidel, save 
only so long as we wait willingly, and with a safe 
hope. <I>St. Paul</I> therefore citing heer a command of <I>the 
Lord Almighty,</I> for so he terms it, that we should 
<I>separate,</I> cannot have bound us with that which he 
calls his own whether command or counsel that we 
should not separate.<BR><IMG
SRC="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">
	Which is the fourth reason, for he himselfe takes 
care least we should mistake him, [<I>But to the rest 
speak I not the Lord</I>. ]  If the Lord spake not, then 
man spake it and man hath no Lordship to command 
the conscience: yet modern interpreters will have it 
a command maugre St. <I>Paul</I> himselfe, they will make 
him a Prophet like <a href="" id="Caiaphas" class="annotBtn"><I>Caiaphas</I></a> to speak the word of 
the Lord not thinking, nay denying to think; though 
he disavow to have receav'd it from the Lord, his 
word shall not be tak'n, though an Apostle, he shall 
be born down in his own Epistle, by a race of 
expositors who presume to know from whom he 
spake, better than he himselfe.  <I>Paul</I> deposes that the 
Lord speaks not this, they, that the Lord speaks it: 
can this be less then to brave him with a full fac't 
contradiction?  Certainly to such a violence as this, 
for I cannot call it an expounding, what a man should 
answer I know not, unless that if it be their pleasure 
next to put a gag into the Apostles mouth, they are 
already furnisht with a commodious audacity 
toward the attempt.  <a href="" id="Beza" class="annotBtn"><I>Beza</I></a> would seem to shun the 
contradictory, by telling us that the Lord spake it not 
in person, as he did the former precept.  But how 
many other doctrines doth St. <I>Paul</I> deliver which 
the Lord spake not in person, and yet never uses 
this preamble but in things indifferent?  So long as 
we receave him for a messenger of God, for him to 
stand sorting sentences what the Lord spake in 
person, and what he, not the Lord in person, would 
be but a chill trifling, and his readers might catch an 
ague the while.  But if we shall supply the 
grammatical <I>Ellipsis</I> regularly, and as we must in the 
sam tense, all will be then cleer, for we cannot 
supply it thus, to the rest I speak; the Lord spake 
not, but I speak, the Lord speaks not.  If then the 
Lord neither spake in person, nor speaks it now, the 
Apostle testifying both, it follows duely, that this can 
be no command.  Forsooth the fear is, least this not 
being a command, would prove an evangelic counsel, 
& so make way for supererogations.  As if the 
Apostle could not speak his mind in things 
indifferent, as he doth in fowr or five several places 
of this chapter with the like preface of not 
commanding, but that the doubted inconvenience of 
supererogating must needs rush in.  And how adds it 
to the word of the Lord, (for this also they object) 
when as the Apostle by his christian prudence guids 
us in the liberty which God hath left us to, without 
command?  could not the spirit of God instruct us by 
him what was free, as well as what was not?  But 
what need I more, when <a href="" id="Cameron" class="annotBtn"><I>Cameron</I></a> an ingenuous 
writer, and in high esteem, solidly confutes the 
surmise of a command heer, and among other words 
hath these. That <I>when Paul speaks as an Apostle, he 
uses this forme,</I> The Lord saith, not I, v. 10. <I>but as a 
privat man he saith,</I> I speak, not the Lord.  And 
thus also all the prime fathers <a href="" id="Austin" class="annotBtn"><I>Austin</I>,</a> <a href="" id="Jerom" class="annotBtn"><I>Jerom</I>,</a> and 
the rest understood this place.<BR><IMG
SRC="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">
	Fifthly, The very stating of the question declares 
this to be no command; <I>If any brother hath an 
unbeleeving wife, and she be pleased to dwell with 
him, let him not put her away</I>.  For the <I>Greek</I> word 
<a href="" id="sune" class="annotBtn"><I>suneudokei</I></a> does not imply only her being pleas'd to 
stay, but his being pleas'd to let her stay; it must be 
a consent of them both.  Nor can the force of this 
word be render'd less, without either much 
negligence or iniquity of him that otherwise 
tranlates it.  And thus the Greek Church also and 
their Synods understood it, who best knew what 
their own language meant, as appears by <I>Matthaeus 
Monachus</I> an author set forth by <a href="" id="Leun" class="annotBtn"><I>Leunclavius</I>,</a> and 
of antiquity perhaps not inferior to <a href="" id="balsamon" class="annotBtn"><I>Balsamon</I></a> who 
writes upon the canons of the Apostles: this Author 
in his chap. <I>that mariage is not to be made with 
heretics</I>, thus recites the second canon of the 6. 
Synod: <I>As to the Corinthians Paul</I> determins, <I>If the 
beleeving wife choos to live with the unbeleeving 
husband, or the beleeving husband with the 
unbeleeving wife</I>.  <I>Mark</I> saith he, <I>how the Apostle 
heer condescends, if the beleever please to dwell with 
the unbeleever; so that if he please not, out of doubt 
the mariage is dissolv'd.  And I am perswaded it was 
so in the beginning, and thus preach't.</I>  And 
therupon gives an example of one, who though not 
deserted, yet by the decree of <a href="" id="theo" class="annotBtn"><I>Theodotus</I> the 
Patriarch</a> divorc't an unbeleeving wife.  What 
therefore depends in the plain state of this question 
on the consent and well liking of them both, must not 
be a command.  Lay next the latter end of the 11. 
v, to the twelf (for wherfore else is Logic taught 
us) in a <I>discreet axiom,</I> as it can be no other by the 
phrase, <I>The Lord saith, let not the husband put away 
his wife, But I say let him not put away a 
misbeleeving wife;</I> this sounds as if by the judgment 
of <I>Paul</I>, a man might put away any wife but the 
misbeleeving; or els the parts are not <I>discrete,</I> or 
<a href="" id="diss" class="annotBtn">dissentanie,</a> for both conclude not putting away, and 
consequently in such a form the proposition is 
ridiculous.  Of necessity therfore the former part of 
this sentence must be conceav'd, as understood, and 
silently granted, that although the Lord command to 
divorce an infidel, yet I, not the Lord command you?  
No, but give my judgment, that for som evangelic 
reasons a christian may be permitted not to divorce 
her.  Thus while we reduce the brevity of St. <I>Paul</I> to 
a plainer sense, by the needful supply of that which 
was granted between him and the Corinthians, the 
very logic of his speech extracts him confessing that 
the Lords command lay in a seeming contrariety to 
this his counsel: and that he meant not to thrust out 
a command of the Lord by a new one of his own, as 
one nail drives another, but to release us from the 
rigor of it, by the right of the Gospel, so farre forth as 
a charitable cause leads us on in the hope of winning 
another soul without the peril of loosing our own.  For 
this is the glory of the Gospel to teach us that <I>the 
end of the commandment is charity,</I> <a href="" id="1tim" class="annotBtn">1 <I>Tim</I>. 1.</a> not the 
drudging out a poore and worthlesse duty forc't from 
us by the <a href="" id="taxe" class="annotBtn">taxe, and taile</a> of so many letters.  This 
doctrine therfore can bee no command, but it must 
contradict the moral law, the Gospel, and the Apostle 
himselfe both else where, and heere also eevn in the act 
of speaking.<BR><IMG
SRC="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">
	If then it be no command, it must remain to be a 
permission, and that not absolute, for so it would be 
still contrary to the law, but with such a caution as 
breaks not the law, but as the manner of the Gospel 
is, fulfils it through charity.  The law had two 
reasons, the one was ceremonial, the pollution that 
all Gentiles were to the Jewes; this the vision of <I>Peter</I> 
had abolisht, <a href="" id="acts10" class="annotBtn">Acts 10.</a> and clens'd all creatures to 
the use of a Christian.  The <I>Corinthians</I> understood not 
this, but fear'd lest dwelling in matrimony with an 
unbeleever, they were defil'd.  The Apostle discusses 
that scruple with an Evangelic reason, shewing them 
that although God heretofore under the law, not 
intending the conversion of the Gentiles, except some 
special ones, held them as polluted things to the Jew, 
yet now purposing to call them in, he hath purify'd 
them from that legal uncleannesse wherin they stood, 
to use and to be us'd in a pure manner.<BR><IMG
SRC="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">
	For saith he, <I>The unbeleeving husband is 
sanctifi'd by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife, is 
sanctifi'd by the husband, else were your children 
uncleane; but now they are holy</I>.  That is, they are 
sanctify'd to you, from that legal impurity which you 
so feare; and are brought into a neer capacity to be 
holy, if they beleeve, and to have free accesse to holy 
things.  In the mean time, as being Gods creatures, a 
christian hath power to use them according to their 
proper use; in as much as now, <I>all things to the pure 
are become pure.</I>  In this legal respect therfore ye 
need not doubt to continue in marriage with an 
unbeleever.  Thus others also expound this place and 
<a href="" id="cam2" class="annotBtn"><I>Cameron</I></a> especially.  This reason warrants us onely 
what wee may doe without feare of pollution, does not 
binde us that we must.  But the other reason of the 
law to divorce an infidel was moral, the avoiding of 
enticement from the true faith.  This cannot shrink; 
but remains in as full force as ever, to save the 
actuall christian from the snare of a misbeleever.  Yet 
if a Christian full of grace and spiritual gifts finding 
the misbeleever not frowardly affected, feares not a 
seducing, but hopes rather a gaining, who sees not that
this morall reason is not violated by not divorcing, 
which the law commanded to doe, but better fulfill'd 
by the excellence of the Gospel working through 
charity.  For neither the faithfull is seduc'd, and the 
unfaithfull is either sav'd, or with all discharge of 
love, and evangelic duty sought to be sav'd.  But 
contrary-wise if the infirme Christian shall bee 
commanded here against his minde, against his hope, 
and against his strength, to dwell with all the 
scandals, the houshold persecutions, or alluring 
temptations of an infidel, how is not the Gospel by 
this made harsher then the law, and more yoaking?  
Therefore the Apostle ere he deliver this other 
reason why wee need not in all hast put away an 
infidel, his mind misgiving him least he should seem 
to be the imposer of a new command, staies not for 
method, but with an abrupt speed inserts the 
declaration of their liberty in this matter.<P><IMG

	<I>But if the unbeleeving depart, let him depart; <a name="intro4">a

	[<I>But if the unbeleeving depart</I>. ]  This cannot be 
restrain'd to locall departure only; for who knows not 
that an offensive society is worse then a forsaking.  If 
his purpose of cohabitation be to endanger the life, 
or the conscience, <a href="" id="beza2" class="annotBtn"><I>Beza</I></a> himselfe is halfe perswaded, 
that this may purchase to the faithfull person the 
same freedome that a desertion may; and so <a href="" id="ger" class="annotBtn"><I>Gerard</I></a> 
and others whom he cites.  If therefore he depart in 
affection, if hee depart from giving hope of his 
conversion; if he disturb, or scoffe at religion, seduce, 
or tempt, if he rage, doubtlesse not the weake only, but 
the strong may leave him; if not for fear, yet for the 
dignities sake of religion, which cannot be liable to all 
base affronts, meerely for the worshiping of a civil 
mariage.  I take therefore <I>departing</I> to bee as large as 
the negative of being well pleas'd: that is, if he be not 
pleas'd for the present to live lovingly, quietly, 
inoffensively, so as may give good hope; which 
appeares well by that which followes.<BR><IMG

	[<I>A brother or a sister is not under bondage in 
such cases</I>. ]  If Saint <I>Paul</I> provide seriously against the 
bondage of a christian, it is not the only bondage to 
live unmaried for a deserting infidel, but to endure 
his presence intolerably, to beare indignities against 
his religion in words or deedes, to be wearied with 
seducements, to have idolatries and superstitions 
ever before his eyes, to be tormented with impure 
and prophane conversation, this must needs be 
bondage to a christian; is this left all unprovided for, 
without remedy, or freedom granted?  undoubtedly 
no, for, the Apostle leavs it furder to be consider'd 
with prudence, what bondage a brother or sister is 
not under, not onely in this case, but as hee speaks 
himselfe plurally, <I>in such cases.</I><BR><IMG
SRC="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="8">
	[<I>But God hath called us to peace</I>. ]  To peace, not to

who is not pleas'd to live peaceably, as mariage and 
christianity requires.  And where strife arises from a 
cause hopelesse to be allayd, what better way to 
peace then by separating that which is ill joyn'd.  It 
is not divorce, that first breaks the peace of a family, 
as som fondly comment on this place, but it is peace 
already brok'n, which, when other cures fail, can 
only be restor'd to the faultles person by a 
necessary divorce.  And Saint <I>Paul</I> heer warrants us to 
seeke peace, rather then to remain in bondage.  If God 
hath call'd us to peace, why should we not follow 
him, why should we miserably stay in perpetual 
discord under a servitude not requir'd?<BR><IMG

	[<I>For what knowest thou O wife, whether thou 
shalt save thy husband, &c.</I> ]  St. <I>Paul</I> having thus 
clear'd himselfe, not to goe about the mining or our 
christian liberty, not <I>to cast a snare upon us,</I> which 
to doe hee so much hated, returnes now to the second 
reason of that law, to put away an infidel for feare of 
seducement, which hee does not heer contradict with 
a command now to venture that; but if neither the 
infirmity of the Christian, nor the strength of the 
unbeleever be fear'd, but hopes appearing that he 
may be won, he judges it no breaking of that law, 
though the beleever be permitted to forbeare divorce, 
and can abide, without the peril of seducement, to 
offer the charity of a salvation to wife or husband, 
which is the fulfilling, not the transgressing of that 
law; and well worth the undertaking with much 
hazard and patience.  For what knowest thou 
whether thou shalt save thy wife, that is, till all 
meanes convenient and possible with discretion and 
probability, as human things are, have bin us'd.  
For Christ himselfe sends not our hope on pilgrimage 
to the worlds end; but sets it bounds, beyond which 
<a href="" id="mat18" class="annotBtn">we need not wait on a brother,</a> much lesse on an 
infidell.  If after such a time we may count a 
professing Christian no better than a heathen, after 
less time perhaps we may cease to hope of a heathen, 
that hee will turne Christian.  Otherwise, to binde us 
harder then the law, and tell us wee are not under 
bondage, is meere mockery.  If till the unbeleever 
please to part, we may not stirre from the house of our 
bondage, then certain this our liberty is not 
grounded in the purchas of Christ, but in the 
pleasure of a miscreant.  What knowes the loyal 
husband whether he may not save the adultresse, 
he is not therfore bound to receive her.  What knowes 
the wife but shee may reclaim her husband who hath 
deserted her?  yet the reformed Churches doe not 
enjoyn her to wait longer then after the contempt of 
an Ecclesiastical Summons.  <a href="" id="beza3" class="annotBtn"><I>Beza</I></a> himselfe heer 
befriends us with a remarkable speech, <I>what could 
be firmly constituted in human matters if under 
pretence of expecting grace from above, it should be 
never lawfull for us to seeke our right.</I>  And yet in 
other cases not lesse reasonable to obtain a most just 
and needfull remedy by divorce he turnes the 
innocent party to a taske of prayers beyond the 
multitude of beads and rosaries, to beg the gift of 
chastity in recompence of an injurious mariage.  But 
the Apostle is evident anough, <I>we are not under 
bondage,</I> trusting that he writes to those who are not 
ignorant what bondage is, to let supercilious 
determiners cheat them of their freedome.  God hath 
call'd us to peace, and so doubtlesse hath left in our 
hands how to obtaine it seasonably; if it be not our 
own choise to sit ever like novices wretchedly 
servile.<BR><IMG

	Thus much the Apostle in this question between 
Christian and Pagan, to us now of little use; yet 
supposing it written for our instruction as it may be 
rightly apply'd, I doubt not but that the difference 
between a true beleever and a heretic, or any one 
truely religious either deserted or seeking divorce 
from any one groslly erroneous or profane may be 
referr'd hither.  For St. <I>Paul</I> leaves us heer the 
solution not of this case only, which little concernes 
us, but of <I>such like cases,</I> which may occurr to us.  For 
where the reasons directly square, who can forbid 
why the verdict should not be the same?  But this 
the common writers allow us not.  And yet from this 
text which in plaine words gives liberty to none 
unlesse deserted by an infidel, they collect the same 
freedom though the desertion bee not for religion, 
which, as I conceive, they neede not doe; but may 
without straining reduce it to the cause of 
fornication.  For first they confesse that desertion is 
seldome without a just suspition of adultery: next it 
is a breach of mariage in the same kind, and in some 
sort worse: for adultery though it give to another, 
yet it bereaves not al; but the deserter wholly 
denies all right, and makes one flesh twain, which is 
counted the absolutest breach of matrimony, and 
causes the other, as much as in him lies, to commit 
sin, by being so left.  Neverthelesse those reasons 
which they bring of establishing by this place the like 
liberty from any desertion, are faire and solid: and if 
the thing be lawfull, and can be prov'd so, more waies 
then one, so much the safer.  Their arguments I shall 
heer recite, and that they may not come idle, shall 
use them to make good the like freedome to divorce 
for other causes; and that we are no more under 
<a name="intro5">bondage</a> to any hainous default against the main 
ends of matrimony, then to a desertion: First they 
allege that to <a href="" id="tim158" class="annotBtn"><I>Tim</I>.1. 5. 8.</a>  <I>If any provide not for 
those of his own house, hee hath deny'd the faith, and 
is worse then an Infidel</I>.  But a deserter, say they, 
<I>can have  no care of them who are most his</I> owne, 
therefore the deserted party is not lesse to bee righted 
against such a one then against an infidel.  With the 
same evidence I argue, <a name="intro1">that</a> man or wife who hates in 
wedloc, is pereptually unsociable, unpeacefull, or 
unduteous, either not being able, or not willing to 
performe what the maine ends of mariage demand in 
helpe and solace, cannot bee said to care for who shou'd 
bee dearest in the house; therefore is worse then an 
infidel in both regards, either in undertaking a duty 
which he cannot performe, to the undeserved and 
unspeakable injury of the other party so defrauded 
and betrai'd, or not performing what he hath 
undertaken, whenas he may or might have, to the 
perjury of himselfe, more irreligious then 
heathenisme.  The blamelesse person therfore hath as 
good a plea to sue out his delivery from this bondage, 
as from the desertion of an infidel.  Since most 
writers cannot but grant that desertion is not only a 
local absence, but an intolerable society; or if they 
grant it not, the reasons of Saint <I>Paul</I> grant it, with as 
much leave as they grant to enlarge a particular 
freedom from paganisme, into a general freedom from 
any desertion.  Secondly, they reason from the 
likenes of either fact, <I>the same losse redounds to the 
deserted by a christian, as by an infidel, the same 
peril of temptation.</I>  And I in like manner affirme, that 
if honest and free persons may be allow'd to know 
what is most to their owne losse, the same losse and 
discontent, but worse disquiet with continuall misery 
and temptation resides in the company, or better 
call'd the persecution of an unfit, or an unpeaceable 
consort, then by his desertion.  For then the 
deserted may enjoy himselfe at least.  And he who 
deserts is more favourable to the party whom his 
presence afflicts, then that importunat thing which 
is and will be ever conversant before the eyes a 
loyal and individual vexation.  As for those who still 
rudely urge it no loss to mariage, no desertion, so 
long as the flesh is present and offers a benevolence 
that hates, or is justly hated, I am not of that vulgar 
and low perswasion, to thinke such forc'd 
embracements as these worth the honour, or the 
humanity of mariage, but farre beneath the soul of a 
rational and freeborne Man.  Thirdly they say, <I>it is 
not the infidelity of the deserter, but the desertion 
of the infidel from which the Apostle gives this 
freedom;</I> and I joyne that the Apostle could as little 
require our subjection to an unfit and injurious 
bondage present, as to an infidel absent.  To free us 
from that which is an evil by being distant, and not 
from that which is an inmate, and in the bosome evil, 
argues an improvident and careles deliverer.  And 
thus all occasions, which way so ever they turn are 
not unofficious to administer somthing which may 
conduce to explain, or to defend the assertion of this 
book touching divorce.  I complain of nothing, but 
that it is indeed too copious to be the matter of a 
dispute, or a defence, rather to be yeelded, as in the 
best ages, a thing of common reason, not of 
controversie.  What have I left to say?  I fear to be 
more elaborat in such perspicuity as this; lest I 
should seem not to teach, but to upbraid the dulnes 
of an age; not to commun with reason in men, but 
to deplore the loss of reason from among men: this 
only, and not the want of more to say, is the limit of 
my discours.<P><IMG

that the names and numbers of such, as have got,

	<a href="" id="jm2" class="annotBtn"><I>Justin Martyr</I></a> in his first Apology writtin within 
50. yeares after St. <I>John</I> dy'd, relates a story which 
<a href="" id="eus" class="annotBtn"><I>Eusebius</I></a> transcribes, that a certain matron of Rome, 
the wife of a vitious husband, her selfe also formerly 
vitious, but converted to the faith, and persuading 
the same to her husband, at lest the amendment of 
his wicked life, upon his not yielding to her daily 
entreaties and persuasions in this behalf, procur'd 
by law to be divorc't from him.  This was neither for 
adultery, nor desertion, but as the relation saies, 
<I>Esteeming it an ungodly thing to be the consort of 
bed with him, who against the law of nature and of 
right sought out voluptuous waies.</I>  Suppose he 
endeavour'd som unnaturall abuse, as the Greek 
admitts that meaning, it cannot yet be call'd 
adultery; it therfore could be thought worthy of 
divorce no otherwise then as equivalent, or wors; 
and other vices will appear in other respects as much 
divorsive.  Next tis said her friends advis'd her to 
stay a while; and what reason gave they? not 
because they held unlawfull what she purpos'd, but 
because they thought she might longer yet hope his 
repentance.  She obey'd, till the man going to 
<I>Alexandria,</I> and from thence reported to grow still 
more impenitent, not for any adultery or desertion, 
wherof neither can be gather'd, but, saith the 
<I>Martyr,</I> and speaks it like one approving, <I>lest she 
should be partaker of his unrighteous and ungodly 
deeds, remaining in wedloc, the communion of bed 
and board with such a person, she left him by a 
lawfull divorce.</I>  This cannot but give us the judgment 
of the Church in those pure and next to Apostolic

permitted, or heer not reprehended; and if a wife 
might then doe this without reprooff, a husband 
certainly might no less, if not more.<BR><IMG

ought, rather to liberty, for the helpe and 
consideration of the weaker sexe, according as the 
Gospel seems to make the wife more equal to her 
husband in these conjugal respects then the law of 
<I>Moses</I> doth.  Therefore <I>if a man were absent from his 
wife foure yeares, and in that space not heard of, 
though gon to warre in the service of the Empire,</I> she 
might divorce, and marry another by the edict of 
<I>Constantine</I> to <I>Dalmatius</I>, <I>Co</I>. l. 5. <I>tit</I>. 17.   And this 
was an age of the Church both antient, and cry'd up 
still for the most flourishing in knowledge and pious 
government since the Apostles.  But to returne to this 
law of <I>Theodosius</I>, with this observation by the way, 
that still as the Church corrupted, as the Clergie 
grew more ignorant, and yet more usurping on the 
Magistrate, who also now declin'd, so still divorce 
grew more restrain'd; though certainly if better 
times permitted the thing that worse times 
restrain'd, it would not weakly argue that the 
permission was better, and the restraint worse.  This 
law therefore of <I>Theodosius</I> wiser in this then the 
most of his successors, though not wiser then God 
and <I>Moses,</I> reduc't the causes of divorce to a certain 
number which by the judiciall law of God, and all 
recorded humanitie, were left before to the brest of 
each husband, provided that the dismisse was not 
without reasonable conditions to the wife.  But this 
was a restraint not yet come to extreames.  For 
besides adultery and that not only actual, but 
suspected by many signes there set down, any fault 
equally punishable with adultery, or equally 
infamous might bee the cause of a divorce. Which 
informes us how the wisest of those ages understood 
that place in the Gospel, whereby, not the pilfering of 
a benevolence was consider'd as the main and only 
breach of wedloc, as is now thought, but the breach 
of love and peace, a more holy union then that of the 
flesh; and the dignity of an honest person was 
regarded, not to bee held in bondage with one whose 
ignominy was infectious.  To this purpose was 
constituted <I>Cod</I>. l. 5. <I>tit</I>. 17. and <I>Authent. collat.</I> 4. <I>tit</I>. 
1. <I>Novell</I>. 22. where <a href="" id="just" class="annotBtn"><I>Justinian</I></a> added three causes 
more.  In the 117. <I>Novell</I>. most of the same causes are 
allow'd, but the liberty of divorcing by consent is 
repeal'd: but by whom? by <I>Justinian</I>, not a wiser, not 
a more religious emperor then either of the former, 
but noted by judicious writers for his fickle head in 
making and unmaking lawes; and how <I>Procopius</I> a 
good historian, and a counselor of state then living 
deciphers him in his other actions, I willingly omitt.  
Nor was the Church then in better case, but had the 
corruption of a 100. declining yeares swept on it, 
when the statute of <I>consent</I> was call'd in; which as I 
said, gives us every way more reason to suspect this 
restraint, more then that liberty: which therfore in 
the reign of <I>Justin</I> the succeeding Emperor was 
recall'd, <I>Novel</I>. 140. & establisht with a preface 
more wise & christianly then for those times, 
declaring the necessity to restore that <I>Theodosian</I> 
law, if no other meanes of reconcilement could be 
found.  And by whom this law was abrogated, or how 
long after, I doe not finde; but that those other causes 
remain'd in force as long as the Greek empire 
subsisted, and were assented to by that Church, is to 
bee read in the Canons and edicts compar'd by <I>Photius</I> 
the Patriarch, with the avertiments of <I>Balsamon,</I> and 
<I>Matthaeus Monachus</I> thereon.<BR><IMG

should teach and ordaine those things which are to 
the helpe and comfort of maried persons, and 
confirme the end of mariage purpos'd in the 
beginning, not those things which afflict and bring 
perpetuall misery to them.</I>  Then answers the 
objection that they are one flesh; <I>if Matrimony had 
held so as God ordain'd it, he were wicked that would 
dissolve it.  But if we respect this in matrimony, that 
it be contracted to the good of both, how shall he, 
who for some great evil feard, perswades not to 
marry though contracted, nor perswade to unmarry, 
if after marriage a calamity befall?  Should we bid 
beware least any fall into an evil, and leave him 
helplesse who by humane error is fall'n therein?  This 
were as if we should use remedies to prevent a

	But in these western parts of the empire it will 
appeare almost unquestionable that the cited law of 
<I>Theodosius</I> and <I>Valentinian</I> stood in force untill the 
blindest and corruptest times of Popedom displac't it.  
For that the volumes of <I>Justinian</I> never came into 
<I>Italy,</I> or beyond <I>Illiricum,</I> is the opinion of good

that <a href="" id="alaric" class="annotBtn"><I>Alaricus</I></a> & <a href="" id="theodoric" class="annotBtn"><I>Theodoric</I></a> their Kings writ their 
statutes out of this <I>Theodosian Code</I> which hath the 
recited law of Divorce.  Neverthelesse while the 
Monarchs of Christendome were yet barbarous, and 
but halfe Christian, the Popes tooke this advantage of 
their weake superstition, to raise a corpulent law out 
of the canons and <I>decretals</I> of audacious preists; and 
presum'd also to set this in the front; <I>That the 
constitutions of princes are not above the 
constitutions of clergy, but beneath them.</I>  Using 
this very instance of divorce as the first prop of 
their tyranny; by a false consequence drawn from a 
passage of <I>Ambrose</I> upon <I>Luke</I> where hee saith, though 
<I>Mans law grant it, yet Gods law prohibits it.</I>  Whence 
<a href="" id="gregtg" class="annotBtn"><I>Gregory</I> the Pope</a> writing to <I>Theoctista</I>, inferrs that 
Ecclesiasticall Courts cannot be dissolv'd by the 
Magistrate.  A faire conclusion from a double error.  
First in saying that the divine law prohibited 
divorce, for what will hee make of <I>Moses</I>; next 
supposing that it did, how will it follow, that 
what ever Christ forbids in his Evangelic precepts, 
should be hal'd into a judicial constraint against the 
patterne of a divine law:  Certainely the Gospel came 
not to enact such compulsions.  In the meane while wee 
may note heere that the restraint of divorce was one 
of the first faire seeming pleas which the Pope had, to 
step into secular authority, and with his 
Antichristian rigor to abolish the permissive law of 
Christian princes conforming to a sacred lawgiver.  
Which if we consider, this papal and unjust 
restriction of divorce need not be so deere to us, since 
the plausible restraining of that, was in a manner the 
first loosning of Antichrist; and as it were the 
substance of his eldest horn.  Nor doe we less 
remarkably ow the first meanes of his fall heer in 
<I>England</I> to the contemning of that restraint by 
<I>Henry</I> 8. whose divorce he oppos'd.  Yet was 
not that rigour executed anciently in spiritual 
Courts untill <a href="" id="pa3" class="annotBtn"><I>Alexander</I> the third,</a> who trod upon the 
neck of <a href="" id="fred" class="annotBtn"><I>Frederic Barbarossa</I></a> the Emperor, and 
summond our <a href="" id="henry2" class="annotBtn"><I>Henry</I> 2.</a> into <I>Normandy</I> about the 
death of <I>Becket.</I>  He it was, that the worthy author 
may be known, who first actually repeal'd the 
imperial law of divorce, and decreed this tyranous 
decree, that matrimony for no cause should be 
disolv'd, though for many causes it might separate; as 
may be seen <a href="" id="decret" class="annotBtn"><I>decret. Gregor</I>. l. 4. <I>tit.</I> 19.</a> and in other 
places of the Canonicall Tomes.  The main good of 
which invention, wherein it consists, who can tell? but 
that it hath one vertue incomparable, to fill all 
christendom with whordomes, and adulteries 
beyond the art of <a href="" id="balaams" class="annotBtn"><I>Balaams</I></a> or of divells.  Yet neither 
can these, though so perverse, but acknowledge that 
the words of Christ under the name of fornication 
allow putting away for other causes then adultery 
both from <I>bed and bord,</I> but not from the <I>bond</I>; 
their only reason is, because mariage they beleeve 
to bee a Sacrament.  But our Divines who would seem 
long since to have renounc't that reason, have so 
forgot themselves, as yet to hold the absurdity, 
which but for that reason, unlesse there be some 
mystery of Satan in it, perhaps the Papist would not 
hold.  Tis true, we grant divorce for actual & 
prov'd adultery, and not for lesse then many tedious 
and unreparable yeares of desertion, wherein a man 
shall loose all his hope of posterity, which great and 
holy men have bewail'd, ere he can be righted; and 
then perhaps on the confines of his old age, when all 
is not worth the while.  But grant this were 
seasonably don; what are these two cases to many 
other, which afflict the state of marriage as bad, and 
yet find no redresse? What hath the soule of man 
deserv'd, if it be in the way of salvation, that it 
should be mortgag'd thus, and may not redeem it 
selfe according to conscience out of the hands of such 
ignorant and slothful teachers as these, who are 
neither able nor mindful to give due tendance to that 
pretious cure which they rashly undertake; nor 
have in them the noble goodnesse to consider these 
distresses and accidents of mans life; but are bent 
rather to fill their mouthes with Tithe and oblation.  
Yet if they can learne to follow, as well as they can 
seeke to be follow'd, I shall direct them to a faire 
number of renowned men, worthy to be their 
leaders, who will commend to them a doctrin in this 
point wiser then their own; and if they bee not-impatient, it will be the same doctrin which this 
treatis hath defended.<BR><IMG

murdering for Religion at the hand of a wife, or 
husband, as he and others enjoyn us to stay and 
venture it for all other causes but that? and why a 
mans life is not as well and warrantably sav'd by 
divorcing from an orthodox murderer, as a heretical?  
Againe, if desertion be confest by him to consist not 
only in the forsaking, but in the unsufferable 
conditions of staying, a man may as well deduce the 
lawfulnesse of divorcing from any deserter, by finding 
it lawful to divorce from a deserting infidel.  For this 
is plaine, if Saint <I>Pauls</I> permission to divorce an infidel 
deserter, inferre it lawfull for any malicious desertion, 
then doth <I>Beza's</I> definition of a deserter transferr 
it selfe with like facility from the cause of religion to 
the cause of malice, and proves it as good to divorce 
from him who intolerably stayes as from him who 
purposely departs; and leaves it as lawfull to depart 
from him who urgently requires a wicked thing, 
though professing the same religion, as from him 
who urges a heathenish or superstitious compliance 
in a different faith.  For if there be such necessity of 
our abiding, wee ought rather to abide the utmost for 
religion then for any other cause; seeing both the 
cause of our stay is pretended our religion to 
mariage, and the cause of our suffering is suppos'd 
our constant mariage to religion.  <I>Beza</I> therfore by 
his owne definition of a deserter justifies a divorce 
from any wicked or intolerable conditions rather in 
the same religion then in a different.<BR><IMG

	<a href="" id="areti" class="annotBtn"><I>Aretius</I></a> a famous Divine of <I>Bern</I> approves many

also.</I>  As first, <I>adultery, and that not actual only, but 
intentional,</I> alleging <I>Matthew</I> the fifth, <I>Whosoever looketh 
to lust, hath committed adultery already in his 
heart.  Wherby</I> saith he, <I>our Saviour shewes that the 
breach of matrimony may be not only by outward 
act, but by the heart and desire; when that hath 
once possest, it renders the conversation 
intolerable, and commonly the fact followes.</I>  Other 
causes to the number of 9. or 10. consenting in 
most with the imperial lawes, may bee read in the 
author himselfe, who averrs them <I>to be grave and 
weighty.</I>  All these are men of name in Divinity' and 
to these if need were, might be added more.  Nor

	These authorities without long search I had to 
produce, all excellent men, som of them such as 
many ages had brought forth none greater: almost 
the meanest of them might deserve to obtain credit 
in a singularity; what might not then all of them 
joyn'd in an opinion so consonant to reason?  For 
although som speak of this cause, others of that, 
why divorce may be, yet all agreeing in the 
necessary enlargement of that textual straitnes, 
leave the matter to equity, not to literal bondage, 
and so the opinion closes.  Nor could I have wanted 
more testimonies, had the cause needed a more 
sollicitous enquiry.  But herein the satisfaction of 
others hath bin studied, not the gaining of more 
assurance to mine own perswasion: although 
authorities contributing reason withall, bee a good 
confirmation and a welcom.  But <a name="intro3">God,</a> I solemnly 
attest him, withheld from my knowledge the 
consenting judgement of these men so late, untill they 
could not bee my instructers, but only my unexpected 
witnesses to partial men, that in this work I had not 
given the worst experiment of an industry joyn'd 
with integrity and the free utterance though of an 
unpopular truth.  Which yet to the people of <I>England</I> 
may, if God so please, prove a memorable informing; 
certainly a benefit which was intended them long 
since by men of highest repute for wisedome & piety 
<I>Bucer & Erasmus.</I>  Only this one autority more, 
whether in place or out of place, I am not to omitt; 
which if any can think a small one, I must bee patient 
it is no smaller then the whole assembl'd autority 
of <I>England</I> both Church and State; and in those times 
which are on record for the purest and sincerest 
that ever shon yet on the reformation of this 
Iland, the time of <a href="" id="edward6" class="annotBtn"><I>Edward</I> the 6<SUP>th</SUP>.</a>  That worthy 
Prince having utterly abolisht the Canon Law out of 
his Dominions, as his Father did before him, 
appointed by full vote of Parlament, a Committy of 
two and thirty chosen men, Divines and Lawyers, of 
whom <I>Cranmer</I> the Archbishop, <I>Peter Martyr</I>, and 
<I>Walter Haddon,</I> (not without the assistance of <a name="cheeke">Sir <I>John 
Cheeke</I></a> the Kings Tutor, a man at that time counted 
the learnedest of Englishmen, & for piety not 
inferior) were the chief, to frame anew som 
Ecclesiastical Laws, that might be instead of what was 
abrogated.  The work with great diligence was 
finisht, and with as great approbation of that 
reforming age was receav'd; and had bin doubtlesse, as 
the learned Preface therof testifies, establisht by Act 
of Parlament, had not the good Kings death so soon 
ensuing, arrested the furder growth of Religion 
also, from that season to this.  Those laws, thus 
founded on the memorable wisedome and piety of that 
religious Parlament and Synod, allow divorce and 
second mariage <I>not only for adultery or desertion, 
but for any captial enmity or plot laid against the 
others life, and likewise for evil and fierce usage:</I> 
nay the 12. Chap. of that title by plaine 
consequence declares, <I>that lesser contentions, if they 
be perpetual, may obtaine divorce</I>: which is all one 
really with the position by me held in the former 
treatise publisht on this argument, herein only 
differing that there the cause of perpetual strife was 
put for example in the unchangeable discord of som 
natures; but in these lawes intended us by the best of 
our ancestors, the effect of continual strife is 
determin'd no unjust plea of divorce, whether the 
cause be naturall or wilfull.  Wherby the warinesse and 
deliberation from which that discourse proceeded, 
will appeare, & that God hath aided us to make no 
bad conclusion of this point; seeing the opinion which 
of late hath undergon ill censures among the 
vulgar, hath now prov'd to have don no violence to 
Scripture, unlesse all these famous Authors alledg'd 
have done the like; nor hath affirm'd ought more 
then what indeed the most nominated Fathers of the 
Church both ancient and modern are unexpectedly found 
affirming, the lawes of Gods peculiar people, & of 
primitive Christendom found to have practis'd, 
reformed Churches and states to have imitated, and 
especially the most pious Church-times of this 
Kingdom to have fram'd and publisht, and, but for 
sad hindrances in the sudden change of religion, had 
enacted by Parlament.  Hence forth let them who 
condemn the assertion of this book for new and 
licentious, be sorry; lest, while they think to be of 
the graver sort, and take on them to be teachers, 
they expose themselves rather to be pledg'd up and 
down by men who intimatly know them, to the 
discovery and contempt of their ignorance and 
presumption.<P>
