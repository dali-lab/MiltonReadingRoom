Milton probably composed this pastoral elegy for his best friend, Charles Diodati, in the fall of 1639, several months after returning from his extended tour of Europe, and about fourteen months after Diodati was buried on August 27, 1638.  The pastoral tone and theme evoked the poetry of Theocritus, Bion, Moschus and Virgil, especially <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi001.perseus-eng1:7\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Eclogue</span> 7</a>, from which Milton borrowed the pastoral name Thyrsis and adapted his refrain.</p><p class=\"next\">Charles Diodati and John Milton had been intimate friends since they were schoolboys at St. Paul\'s in London.

"thyrsis":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Thyrsis.</i>  The name Milton chooses for his persona is also that of the pastoral singer in Theocritus\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Idyll</span> 1, who sings a lament for Daphnis.  (Search <a href=\"http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"main\">Dartmouth Library Catalogue.</a>) In <span class=\"booktitle\">Idyll</span> 1, Thyrsis is acclaimed as having \"brought to perfection the bucolic art.\"  Thyrsis is also the persona taken by the Attendant Spirit in <a href=\"../comus/text.shtml#t.shepherd\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Comus</span></a>.  </span>",
"himera":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Himera.</i>   A river in Sicily. By calling on the Himerides, nymphs of Himera, as his muses, Milton signals that this poem belongs to the Theocritean tradition of pastoral lament.  We are asked to imagine a setting on a Sicilian hillside, the speaker and his beloved Damon as fellow shepherds sharing pastoral songs with one another.</span>",
"hylas":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Hylas.</i>   In Theocritus\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Idyll</span> 13, \"Hylas the Beautiful\" is drowned by amorous water nymphs.

See Milton\'s <a href=\"../elegiarum/elegy_7/latin.shtml\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Elegy</span> 7</a>.24.</span>",
"bion":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Bion.</i>   Bion, who wrote the <span class=\"booktitle\">Lament for Adonis</span>, is the subject of Moschus\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Lament for Bion</span>, the locus classicus of the pastoral elegy mourning the death of another poet.  (Search <a href=\"http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"main\">Dartmouth Library Catalogue</a>.)  Diodati was not a poet by vocation, but he and Milton used to correspond in Latin and Greek verse.</span>",
"sicilian":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Sicilian song.</i>  Theocritus, the father of the written pastoral tradition, was probably Sicilian.  See  <a href=\"../lycidas/text.shtml#sicilian\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> 133</a> and the opening of Virgil\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi001.perseus-eng1:4\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Eclogues</span> 4</a>.</span>",
"twice":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Twice.</i>   The wheat has ripened and been harvested twice since Charles Diodati (Damon) died.  This may mean that two years have past, or, more likely, since Diodati was buried on August 27, 1638, and Milton probably composed this poem in the fall of 1639, only about fourteen months had passed, though there had been two ripenings and two harvests of wheat.</span>",

"refrain":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Go home unfed, my lambs, your troubled master is not free to tend you.</i>   Theocritus\'s Thyrsis also punctuatates his lament in <span class=\"booktitle\">Idyll</span> 1 with a persistent refrain, as do Bion and Moschus in the <span class=\"booktitle\">Lament for Adonis</span> and the <span class=\"booktitle\">Lament for Bion</span> respectively.  Milton\'s refrain is often supposed to echo Virgil\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi001.perseus-eng1:7\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Eclogues</span> 7</a>, in which the Virgilian Thyrsis speaks the line, \"Ite domum pasti, si quis pudor, ite iuvenci\" (44):  \"Go home, my cattle, from your grazing go!\"  This eclogue is a singing contest between Thyrsis and Corydon, giving the allusion resonance when Milton\'s Thyrsis later describes the singing contest he joined in Florence.</span>",
"him":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>him.</i>   Hermes as Psychopomp, conductor of the souls of the dead to Hades.  Hermes, the son of Zeus, was also messenger of the gods.

"silent":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>silent.</i>  The \"silent\" souls in Hades remained silent forever.  Thyrsis\'s fear is that Damon will be rendered silent in death.  The whole poem might be seen as an attempt to engage Damon in conversation.  Milton and Diodati valued greatly in their friendship the fact that they provided each other a \"mind fit to converse with,\" as Diodati puts it in a 1626 letter to Milton.  (<a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#french\" target=\"main\">French</a> 105).  </span>",

"daphnis":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Daphnis.</i>   Again, Thyrsis\'s concern seems to be preventing Damon\'s \"silence.\"  This passage echoes Menalcas\'s promise to the departed Daphnis in Virgil\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0893.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.5\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Eclogues</span> 5.97-99</a>: </p><blockquote>Long as the wild boar<br />  Shall love the mountain-heights, and fish the streams,<br />  While bees on thyme and crickets feed on dew,<br />  Thy name, thy praise, thine honour, shall endure.<br /></blockquote><p></span>",

"palladian":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Palladian arts.</i>   The Latin is <span class=\"booktitle\">Palladi&aacute;sque artes</span>, or \"and Palladian arts,\" the arts of Athena as goddess of learning and wisdom.  Diodati had studied at Oxford and Geneva.  Milton\'s friendship with him had begun when they were childhood schoolmates and was based to a great extent on mutual intellectual esteem.</span>",
"elms":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>elms.</i>   Horace\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Epode</span> 13 sets up a similar juxtaposition between the storm outside and warmth and company inside.   (Search <a href=\"http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"main\">Dartmouth Library Catalogue.</a>)  Horace\'s solution, however, is wine, whereas Milton\'s is \"pleasant conversation.\"</span>",
"noon":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Pan takes his sleep.</i>   Pan sleeps at noon in Theocritus\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Idyl</span> 1.16.  In <a href=\"../pl/book_5/text.shtml#converse\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> 5.230-231</a>, Adam is also resting in the noonday shade when Raphael descends to engage him in a conversation that lasts for three books. Because Adam can have \"no satiety\" (<a href=\"../pl/book_8/text.shtml#satiety\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> 8.216</a>) from Raphael\'s words, he keeps the conversation going until they, too, lull the day to rest with talk.</span>",

"master":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>turn their faces to their master.</i>  Thyrsis\'s neglect of his farm, and especially of his sheep, of which he reminds us with every iteration of the refrain, is a gross transgression of pastoral values.  Here he claims that the grief that inspires it is shared by his sheep.  The sheep may be sad for lack of food, but they may also be mourning Damon, as do herds of cattle for Daphnis in Theocritus\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Idyl</span> 1. See <a href=\"../lycidas/text.shtml#sheep\" target=\"main\">\"Lycidas\" 125</a>.</span>",
