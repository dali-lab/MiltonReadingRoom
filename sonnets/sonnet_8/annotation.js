var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  According to Barbara Lewalski, this sonnet \"inaugurates the political sonnet in the English tradition\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#barbara_lewalski\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Life of John Milton</span></a> 158).  The poem invites  readers to imagine that the poet pins this sonnet to his door to protect his property during a military attack.  Milton, like most of London in 1642, probably did expect the King\'s forces to attack the city.  Milton therefore frames the poem as a  plea for special protection for poets in time of war.  In its gesture, the poem alludes  to Alexander the Great, who is said to have spared the house of the poet Pindar during his invasion of Thebes. There was no title to this sonnet in the <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/114721/29\" target=\"main\">1645</a> and <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/60223/32\" target=\"main\">1673</a> editions.
