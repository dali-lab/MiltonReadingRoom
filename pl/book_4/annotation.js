"sat":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>whom he created what I was</i>.  This is an example of Satan contradicting himself. Compare to <a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#selfbegot\" target=\"main\">5.860</a> where he claims that angels are \"self-begot.\" Satan seems, in these few lines of soliloquy, to be unusually candid, admitting his mistake to himself if to no one else.</span>",

"mean":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>mean</i>.  Inferior. </span>",
"freelove":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>dealt equally</i>.  This soliloquy, lines 32-68, repays close attention and analysis, especially an attempt to trace first the logic, then the psychology of each twist and turn, as suggested in line 115 below.  For example, in line 67 Satan verges on concluding he has no one to blame but himself, but he finishes his sentence in line 68 by accusing, of all things, \"Heav\'ns free Love.\"</span>",
"freely":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Chose freely</i>.  Satan, for at least a brief moment, agrees with God\'s description of the rebellion in <a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#fellwhofell\" target=\"main\">3.102</a>: \"Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.\" </span>",

Nevertheless, words like \"wilderness,\" \"wild,\" and \"overgrown\" may challenge received notions of what Paradise looked like.  1674 misprints this as \"gottesque\" for some reason; I have corrected it based on 1667.</span>",

"of":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>of</i>.  From. </span>",
"cape":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Cape of Hope</i>.  The Cape of Good Hope. This whole passage describing Eden\'s delights also suggests the effects those delights might have both on Satan (he is past Hope) and on mortals.  It also evokes once again the exoticism of lands associated with the spice trade as in <a href=\"../book_2/text.shtml#spice\" target=\"main\">2.640</a>. </span>",

"grat":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>grateful</i>.  Pleasant. </span>",
"tobias":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Asmodeus</i>.  Milton invokes the story of Tobias from the apocryphal Book of Tobit. Tobias, traveling in Persia, married Sara whose seven former husbands were killed on their wedding night by her demon lover, Asmodeus. Raphael advised Tobias to burn the heart and liver of a fish to drive the demon away (<a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/bible/kjv-apoc/Tobit/8.txt\" target=\"main\">Tobit 8</a>: 3).</span>",
"brake":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>brake</i>.  Shrubbery. </span>",
"bound":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>one slight bound</i>.  The ease with which Satan enters Paradise, despite the appointed angelic guard, has often been the topic of critical comment.  How are we supposed to understand this feature of Eden--walled, but not adequately walled?  The following similes (wolf and burglar) complicate the question.</span>",
"sheer":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>sheer</i>.  Wholly or completely. </span>",
"similes":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>first grand Thief</i>.  The extended similes raise lots of questions.  Are we invited to think of God as a less than adequate shepherd and mankind as sheep?  Or of God as overlooking windows or roof access and human being as his lifeless gold?</span>",
"lewd":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>lewd Hirelings</i>.  Milton  compares Satan\'s leap into Eden to the entrance of \"lewd hirelings\" (self-serving clergymen) into the Church. A similar image of self-serving clergy as wolves appears in <a href=\"../../lycidas/text.shtml#hirelings\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> 113-131</a>.

"crisped":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>crisped</i>. Rippling.</span>",
"er":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>error</i>. Wandering. </span>",
"art":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>nice Art</i>.  \"Art\" here has a negative connotation, implying artifice or deceit.  \"Nice\" here connotes extravagant or flaunting.  Milton implies that intricately planned man-made gardens are inferior to the profuse and less appararently organized abundance of nature in Eden. </span>",
"curious":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Beds and curious Knots</i>.  <a href=\"../../graphics/garden.shtml\" target=\"main\">Tudor formal gardens</a> were often very intricate affairs, carefully planned and tended.

"shade":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Imbround</i>.  Browned, darkened. </span>",

Referring to the stories of Hesperian gardens, a legendary orchard at the edge of the world where golden fruit grew, as told in Ovid\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:4.604\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span> 4</a>. 637-680.

"pan":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>the Graces and the Hours</i>.   The Graces, in Greek religion, were agroup of goddesses of fertility. The name refers to the \"pleasing\" or\"charming\" appearance of a fertile field or garden. The number of Gracesvaried in different legends, but usually there were three: Aglaia (Brightness),Euphrosyne (Joyfulness), and Thalia (Bloom). They are said to be daughtersof Zeus and Hera (or Eurynome, daughter of Oceanus) or of Helios andAegle, a daughter of Zeus.  According to Hesiod, the Horae werethe children of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Themis, a Titaness, and theirnames (Eunomia, Dike, Eirene--that is, Good Order, Justice, Peace) indicate theextension of their functions from nature to the events of human life. AtAthens they were apparently two in number: Thallo and Carpo, thegoddesses of the flowers of spring and of the fruits of summer. Their yearlyfestival was the Horaea. In later mythology the Horae became the fourseasons, daughters of the sun god, Helios, and the moon goddess, Selene,each represented with the conventional attributes.  See Botticelli\'s <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/art/b/botticel/5allegor/10primav.jpg\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Primavera.</span></a></span>",
"milt":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Proserpin</i>.  Milton refers to the stories of Proserpina in Ovid\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:5.341\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphosis</span> 5</a> and the Homeric <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002.perseus-eng1:1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Hymn to Demeter.</span></a> Proserpina, daughter of Zeus and Ceres, is carried away by Dis (Pluto) while gathering flowers in Enna, Sicily.   Ceres, the goddess of corn, prevented any crops from growing while she searched for her daughter. Finally, Dis agreed to return Proserpina to her mother for six months each year. Thus, the crops only grow for half a year.  These might be called negative similes, since each comparison is evoked by \"Not\" or \"nor.\"</span>",
"dap":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Daphne</i>.  The gardens of Daphne on the river Orontes in Syria were known for their magnificent cypress and laurel trees, which were watered by a springs, dedicated to Apollo and named after the Castalian Spring on Mt. Parnassus. According to Ovid (<a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:1.452\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span> 1.450-68</a>), upon Phoebus Apollo\'s attempt to rape her, Daphne tried to run away and then turned into a laurel tree. See Bernini\'s <a href=\"http://www.thais.it/scultura/sch00342.htm\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Apollo e Dafne</span></a>  </span>",
"island":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Nyseian Isle</i>.  An island where Ammon, the son of Saturn and king of Lybia, had his son Bacchus brought up to protect him from his stepmother Rhea. Ammon was identified with Jove and Noah\'s son Ham (<a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#orgel\" target=\"main\">Orgel &amp; Goldberg</a> 879). </span>",
"ab":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Abbasin</i>.  Abyssinian.</span>",
"kids":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>issue</i>.  Children</span>",
"amara":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Amara</i>.  In Milton\'s time, Amara, a hill in modern day Ethiopia, was by some thought to be paradise located on the equator (the \"Ethiop Line\").</span>",
"erect":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>erect</i>.  Milton repeats the word, \"erect,\" as if standing erect were as much, or more, a matter of nobility and godlikeness as it is simply a matter of walking on two, rather than four legs.  In <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#erect\" target=\"main\">book 8. 289</a>, Adam uses the word to imply that erect beings are spiritually and mentally more capable than non-erect beings.</span>",
"image":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>image of thir glorious Maker shon</i>.  In Milton\'s view, does God\'s image in man signify or constitute human superiority over the rest of creation?  In <span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon,</span> Milton defines more precisely what he takes to be the \"Image of God\" (<a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#Image\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span> Gen. 1.27</a>).  This opening description of Adam and Eve runs together the two accounts from Genesis: <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+1&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 1: 26-31</a> which describes the creation of mankind as both male and female at once; and <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 2</a>, which describes the creation of Adam first, then Eve from Adam. </span>",
"filial":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>filial freedom</i>.  Apparently both Adam and Eve enjoy the same \"filial freedom,\" that is, the freedom characteristic of children and heirs of the Father.  <span lang=\"la\">Filius</span> is Latin for son and <span lang=\"la\">filia</span> for daughter, so the English word, \"<a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\">filial</a>\" may be read as including both genders and so referring to both Adam and Eve, as \"men\" in line 295 appears to include Eve as well as Adam, as in the word, \"mankind.\"  But note how the tenor of the passage shifts at precisely this point.</span>",
"notequal":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Not equal</i>.  This line and those that follow have occasioned a great deal of commentary in recent years.  See especially <a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#turner\" target=\"main\">Turner, <span class=\"booktitle\">One Flesh</span></a>; <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mccolley\" target=\"main\">McColley, <span class=\"booktitle\">Milton\'s Eve</span></a>; and most helpful:<a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#nyquist\" target=\"main\"> Nyquist, \"The Genesis of Gendered Subjectivity in the Divorce Tracts and in <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost.</span>\"</a>  Milton appears to follow Pauline teaching on marriage (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=1+Timothy+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">1 Timothy 2:11</a>) fairly closely, at least <em>his</em> understanding of Pauline teaching.  Milton was very likely aware of popular pamphlets that argued the equality (even sometimes superiority) of women.  See the collection of such pamphlets in <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#halfhuman\" target=\"main\">Katherine U. Henderson\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Half Humankind.</span></a>   One of them, <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/rachel.html\" target=\"main\">Rachel Speght\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">A Mouzell for Melastomus,</span></a> is available in a web edition from <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/ren.htm\" target=\"main\">Renascence Editions</a>.</span>",
"seemd":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>seemd</i>.  The use of \"seemed\" in this passage is worth close attention.  Sometimes it implies a theory of the perfect coincidence of appearance and reality in prelapsarian Paradise; other times it may be taken to refer to the way things looked to Satan, who is the implied observer throughout this passage.</span>",
"contemplation":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>contemplation hee</i>.  Many readers have noted that these two lines appear to describe Adam as a looker and a doer (contemplation and valour) and Eve as one looked at and acted upon (attractive and soft).  Indeed Adam shows a strong interest in abstruse subjects when he talks with the archangel Raphael (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#cosmology\" target=\"main\">book 8.15-40</a>) and Eve prefers to participate in conversations that are not entirely abstract, but include touching and feeling as well (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#caresses\" target=\"main\">8.52-57</a>).</span>",
"godhim":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>shee for God in him</i>.  Adam was created in God\'s image, while Eve was subsequently created from Adam.  Milton implies that Adam is closer to God and more capable of discourse with God than Eve, an idea that appears again in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#caresses\" target=\"main\">8.54-56</a>.</span>",
"front":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Front</i>.  Forehead, as if a large forehead indicated intelligence.</span>",
"sub":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>sublime</i>.  Oriented heavenward.</span>",
"lok":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Hyacinthin Locks</i>.  The poem  compares Adam to Hyacinthus, the boy beloved of Apollo in Orpheus\'s song from Ovid\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:10.143\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span> 10</a>.163-219.  Milton likens Adam to Apollo\'s \"beloved\" as an example of ideal male beauty. Milton often alludes to Orpheus (<a href=\"../../lycidas/text.shtml#orpheus\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> 58-63</a>, <a href=\"../../comus/text.shtml#orpheus\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask</span> 84-88</a>, \"<a href=\"../../at_a_solemn_music/text.shtml#orpheus\" target=\"main\">At a Solemn Music</a>\") as a classical example of the power of poetic song.  Homer describes Odysseus\'s head and hair in a similar fashion at just those moments when Athena pays special attentions to him (<a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng2:6.6\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Odyssey</span> 6</a>. 231: \"she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in              curls like hyacinth blossoms\').  The word \"Clustring\" also alludes to a similar description of the \"fair clustering tresses\" Venus bestows upon Aeneas in the <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:1.579\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Aeneid</span> 1.590-91</a>.

On hair length for men and women, see also <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=1+Corinthians+11&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">1 Corinthians 11:15</a>.  See John Guillory\'s essay, <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#guillory\" target=\"main\">\"Milton, Narcissism, Gender: On the Genealogy of Male Self-Esteem.\"</a> Perhaps Milton imagines an Adam not unlike Michelangelo\'s <a href=\"http://www.kfki.hu/~arthp/art/m/michelan/1sculptu/david/head.jpg\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">David</span></a> (1504).</span>",
"ve":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>veil</i>.  It seems odd that Eve needs a veil considering lines 312 and 313. </span>",
"dish":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Disheveld</i>.  As with the vegetation in Paradise which apparently requires the attention of a gardener, so we are surprised to find Eve\'s hair described as dishevelled, or <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\">wanton</a>.</span>",
"coy":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>coy</i>.  Shy or reserved. </span>",
"adameve":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>modest pride</i>.  The physical portrayal of Adam and Eve is complex, like these oxymoronic expressions.  Milton\'s description of Adam focuses on his head, suggesting Adam\'s most important characteristic is his intellect; Eve\'s \"unadorned golden tresses\" pull the focus away from her head to her entire body, implying her primary characteristic is her beauty and grace, though we shall later be instructed, as was Eve, just how far \"manly grace and wisdom\" exceed female beauty and how wisdom alone can be called \"truly fair\" (490-91). </span>",
"mysterious":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>mysterious parts</i>.  That is, their genitals.  Milton chooses the word \"mysterious\" to remind readers that \"connubial rites\" (line 743) are truly (though allegorically or typologically) about the relations between Christ and his church (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Ephesians+5&amp;version=KJV&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref=yes&amp;language=english\" target=\"main\">Ephesians 5</a>:31-32), \"mysteriously meant,\" like the stairs that lead to heaven (<a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">3.516</a>).</span>",
"pure":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>dishonest</i>.  Impure or unchaste. </span>",
"unfit":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>meer shews</i>.  In his divorce tracts Milton complained incessantly about women whose false shows of modesty and shamefastness led the men who married them into the worst hell imaginable--marriage to an unfit partner.  See <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#sober_man\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce.</span></a> </span>",
"work":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Gardning labour</i>.  We might be surprised at first that Milton thinks there was labor in Paradise, but Milton, like many of us, loved to work and thought it a source of pleasure.  Milton also specifies that prelapsarian work, in proper amounts, also enhanced other pleasures, like that of feeling a cool wind, taking rest, satisfying a thirst, or an appetite for food.</span>",

"room":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>our room</i>.  Satan refers to the \"vacant room\" of the fallen angels in <a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#line190\" target=\"main\">7.190</a>.  The idea is that mankind and his world was created to \"repair\" the loss of the fallen angels.  See <a href=\"#instead\" target=\"notes\">note above</a>.</span>",
"hast":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Little inferior</i>.  Satan echoes the sense of <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Psalm+8&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Psalm 8</a>: \"Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.\" See also <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Shakespeare/hamlet/hamlet.2.2.html#319\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Hamlet</span> 2.2.319</a>: \"What a piece of work is a man!\"</span>",

The lines echo <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Isaiah+14&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Isaiah 14</a>: 9, but the tone with which Satan echoes the prophet is worth pondering. <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#john_\" target=\"main\">John Leonard</a>, in his introduction to <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> (xxxv-xxxvi) points out that Satan\'s speech also echoes  Pluto in Claudian\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Raptu Proserpinae</span> 2.300 (<a href=\"http://www.theoi.com/Text/ClaudianProserpine.html#2\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Rape of Proserpine</span> 2.300</a>).</span>",

"dust":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>dust</i>.  Adam was made by God from the dust of the earth and Eve made from his rib according to <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+2&amp;version=KJV&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref=yes&amp;language=english\" target=\"main\">Genesis 2</a>.

"death":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>dreadful thing</i>.  Adam has not yet witnessed death; though he understands it is a \"dreadful thing,\" his knowledge of it is limited.  See his first glimpse of death in <a href=\"../book_11/text.shtml#death\" target=\"main\">11.445-93</a> when Michael shows him his son\'s murder.</span>",

"noend":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>without whom am to no end</i>.  Milton was not alone in believing that the only purpose for which woman was created is to remedy a man\'s loneliness. See <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#conversation\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce.</span></a>  The phrase \"flesh of thy flesh\" directly echoes Adam\'s words in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+2&amp;version=KJV&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref=yes&amp;language=english\" target=\"main\">Genesis 2</a>: 23. </span>",

Adam, we learn in book 8, specifically asked God to supply him with an equal partner, one like himself (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#equal\" target=\"main\">8.381-397</a>).  Yet here Eve implies that Adam is so much her superior as to have no equal on earth and so no like consort.  Is Eve mistaken?</span>",
"create":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>I first awak\'t</i>.  Compare to the description of Adam\'s awakening in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#newwakt\" target=\"main\">8.253</a>.</span>",
"what":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>what</i>.  Eve refers to herself as \"what\" and Adam as \"who\"; overall, there are slight but revealing differences between the first questions that come to Eve\'s mind and those that come to Adam\'s mind.  See <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#whoiwas\" target=\"main\">8.270</a>.</span>",
"ca":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>expanse of Heav\'n</i>.  Eve is incorporating knowledge retrospectively; What is here expressed as a simile, she took for an identity when new waked to consciouness (line 459). See Linda Gregerson\'s essay, \"Fault lines: Milton\'s Mirror of Desire.\" in <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#gregerson\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Reformation of the Subject: Spenser Milton and the English Protestant Epic.</span></a></span>",
"sky":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>seem\'d another Skie</i>.  Eve looks down at the lake, while Adam\'s first act is to look up toward Heaven in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#upward\" target=\"main\">8.257</a>.  Her confusion of earth and sky may be seen as an early indication of Eve\'s vulnerability to Satan\'s temptation.</span>",
"met":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>A Shape</i>.  Milton echoes here in Eve\'s actions the myth of <a href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~classics/slides/a64.jpeg\" target=\"main\">Narcissus</a> in Ovid\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:3.337\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span> 3</a>.402-510. For further discussion of Eve\'s narcissism see the essay by James Earl, \"Eve\'s Narcissism\" in <span class=\"booktitle\">Milton Quarterly</span>19 (1985):13-16.</span>",
"self":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self</i>.  This may be read as implying that Eve\'s self (apart from Adam as she presently is) is no deeper a thing than her appearance.  In book 8, Raphael refers to Eve\'s beauty as \"an outside\" (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#outside\" target=\"main\">8.568</a>).</span>",
"staies":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>staies</i>.  Awaits.</span>",
"deriv":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Whose image thou art</i>.  That is, Adam.  Eve, like Adam, carries the image of God, but for Eve this image is derivative; she is more immediately in Adam\'s image than in God\'s.  See this point made explicit in  <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#himnotthem\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon.</span></a></span>",
"led":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>invisibly thus led</i>.  Eve does not recognize the voice as God, but it is one of the chief features of God\'s beauty to be invisible (<a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#invisible\" target=\"main\">5. 157</a>).  Milton may be suggesting a natural tendency in Eve to follow and obey.  Also have a look at <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/index1.html\" target=\"main\">Bosch\'s (1450-1516) depiction</a> of Eve being led to Adam.</span>",

"tree":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Platan</i>.  Plane tree. </span>",
"faire":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>watry image</i>.  \"Watry\" may pun here on the sense of watered down or less clear since Eve\'s image in the lake is merely a reflection of her image, which is in turn a reflection of Adam\'s inward \"manly grace and wisdom,\" which is, in turn,  the image of God in Adam. </span>",
"following":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Thou following</i>.  See Adam\'s version of this event as told to Raphael in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#ledbygod\" target=\"main\">8.484-510</a>.</span>",
"ind":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>individual</i>.  Inseparable.</span>",
"trulyfair":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>truly fair</i>.  A distinction is formed here between \"faire\" as properly applied to Eve (481) and \"truly fair\" which applies only to \"wisdom,\" a quality essentially invisible though capable of demonstration.  Eve is fair, beautiful on the outside, but Adam\'s inward \"wisdom\" is \"truly fair,\" that is, more like the image of God, partly, paradoxically, because it is an invisible, inner quality.</span>",
"inno":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>unreprov\'d</i>.  Innocent.</span>",
"submiss":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Beauty and submissive Charms</i>.  Beauty alone, however attractive, does not delight Adam as much as beauty combined with submission.</span>",
"king":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Jupiter</i>.  King of gods and sky.</span>",

"plaind":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>plaind</i>.  Complained, whined.</span>",
"desire":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fierce desire</i>.  Desire here is implicitly distinguished from love.</span>",
"sintoknow":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>can it be sin to know</i>.  Satan already prepares his temptation arguments.  The sin, of course, is not knowledge or even desire for knowledge, but disobedience, but see also Raphael\'s notion that the desire for knowledge requires temperance (<a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#temperance\" target=\"main\">7.126-130</a>) and also Denis Albanese\'s discussion of the <a href=\"../../bibliography/a-b/text.shtml#albanese\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">New Science, New World.</span></a></span>",
"equalgods":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Envious commands</i>.  Satan ascribes his own feelings of envy to God, claiming that God denies Adam and Eve knowledge of good and evil because He envies them.</span>",

"noon2":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Meridian hour</i>.  Noon.</span>",
"hardguard":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Spiritual substance</i>.  Presumably this is why Satan cannot be kept out of Paradise since he is made of \"Spiritual substance.\"  But what besides the spirits of Hell is Gabriel\'s squad supposed to guard against?</span>",
"hor":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>slope downward</i>.  Since the sun is now below the horizon, Uriel slides down on a beam as he returns to his station in the sun.</span>",

"orb":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>prime Orb</i>.  The sun. Milton does not commit himself to either a <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/retrograde/aristotle.html\" target=\"main\">Ptolemaic</a> or <a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/retrograde/copernican.html\" target=\"main\">Copernican</a> cosmology. </span>",
"diu":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Diurnal</i>.  In a day.</span>",

The dignity of work, along with walking erect, speaking language and enjoying God\'s special attention are features that distinguish humans from beasts in Milton\'s world-view.</span>",
"allies":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Allies</i>.  Alleys.</span>",
"manu":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>manuring</i>.  Tillage, cultivation; though Milton may also mean us to imagine that Adam and Eve fertilized their garden with manure.</span>",
"morehands":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>More hands then ours</i>.  Milton reckons that for Paradise to be truly perfect, there must be work available for Adam\'s children, since work is one of life\'s great pleasures, and a distinctly human dignity.</span>",
"riddance":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Ask riddance</i>.  Must be removed.</span>",
"conversing":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>conversing</i>.  See Milton\'s definition of the purpose of marriage and woman\'s creation in the <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#conversation\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span></a>--\"an apt and cheerful conversation.\"  See also Adam\'s expression of pleasure at conversation with Raphael in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#raph_conversation\" target=\"main\">book 8</a>.</span>",

She was endowed with gifts by the gods, given a box filled with evils, and sent to marry Epimetheus (hindsight), a brother of Prometheus.  Although warned against it, Epimetheus opened the box and all life\'s evils flew out.  Pandora and Eve are \"like in sad event\" in that they are both associated with tragic events (see Hesiod\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg002.perseus-eng1:59\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Works and Days</span> 80</a>).</span>",

"wee":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>weene</i>.  Suppose.</span>",
"handed":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>handed</i>.  Joined hand in hand.</span>",
"sex":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>connubial Love</i>.  Milton probably shocked his earliest readers by suggesting that Adam and Eve had sexual relations before the fall, but we should also note how carefully he has kept anything like sexual desire out of this description:  Adam, we are told, did not \"turn\" from his wife, and Eve did not \"refuse\" the \"Rites mysterious\" (referring to <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Ephesians+5&amp;version=KJV&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref=yes&amp;language=english\" target=\"main\">Ephesians 5</a>: 31-32) The activity sounds like obedience to God\'s command (line 747) rather than sexual desire;  see also Milton\'s notion of \"rational burning\" as explained in <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#rationalburn\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce,</span> book 1</a>.  </span>",
