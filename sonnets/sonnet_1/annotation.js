The nightingale is the \"bird of song\" who portends \"success in love\" and brings good fortune to those who listen to its melodious song. The cuckoo is the \"rude Bird of Hate\" most commonly associated with jealously and cuckoldry.  The contrast between the nightingale and cuckoo enables Milton to establish the symbolic identification of Philomel with chastity which receives  explicit reiteration in <a href=\"../../comus/text.shtml#nightingale\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask</span></a> (<a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#variorum\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"varspell\" title=\"booktitle\">Variorum</span></a> 2(2): 357).  <span class=\"author\">Collin O\'Mara and Amar Dhand</span></span>",
