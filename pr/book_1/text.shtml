<p>
O ancient Powers of Air and this wide world,<br />

For much more willingly I mention Air,<span class="line" id="line45"> [ 45 ]</span><br />
This our old Conquest, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> remember Hell<br />
Our hated habitation; well ye know<br />
How many Ages, <a href="" id="asmen" class="annotBtn">as the years of men</a>,<br />
This Universe we have <span class="varspell" title="possessed">possest</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="ruled">rul'd</span><br />

In manner at our will <span class="varspell" title="the">th'</span> affairs of Earth,<span class="line" id="line50"> [ 50 ]</span><br />
Since <span class="mi">Adam</span> and his <a href="" id="facile" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="facile">facil</span></a> consort <span class="mi">Eve</span><br />
Lost Paradise <span class="varspell" title="deceived">deceiv'd</span> by me, though since<br />
With dread <a href="" id="attending" class="annotBtn">attending</a> when that fatal wound<br />
Shall be inflicted by the Seed of <span class="mi">Eve</span><br />

Upon my head, long the decrees of <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span><span class="line" id="line55"> [ 55 ]</span><br />
Delay, for <a href="" id="psalm" class="annotBtn">longest time to him is short</a>;<br />
And now too soon for us the circling hours<br />
This dreaded time have <span class="varspell" title="compassed">compast</span>, wherein we<br />
Must bide the <span class="varspell" title="stroke">stroak</span> of that long <span class="varspell" title="threatened">threatn'd</span> wound,<br />

At least if so we can, and by the head<span class="line" id="line60"> [ 60 ]</span><br />
Broken be not intended all our power<br />
To be <a href="" id="infringed" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="infringed">infring'd</span></a>, our freedom and our being<br />
In this fair Empire won of Earth and Air;<br />
For this ill news I bring, the <span class="varspell" title="Woman's">Womans</span> seed<br />

<span class="varspell" title="Destined">Destin'd</span> to this, is late of woman born,<span class="line" id="line65"> [ 65 ]</span><br />
His birth to our just fear gave no small cause,<br />
But his growth now to <span class="varspell" title="youth's">youths</span> full <span class="varspell" title="flower">flowr</span>, displaying<br />
All <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, grace and <a href="" id="wisdom" class="annotBtn">wisdom</a> to <span class="varspell" title="achieve">atchieve</span><br />
Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.<br />

Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim<span class="line" id="line70"> [ 70 ]</span><br />
His coming, is sent Harbinger, who all<br />
Invites, and in the Consecrated stream<br />
Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so<br />
Purified to receive him pure, or rather<br />

To do him <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> as their King; all come,<span class="line" id="line75"> [ 75 ]</span><br />
And he himself among them was <span class="varspell" title="baptised">baptiz'd</span>,<br />
Not thence to be more pure, but to receive<br />
The testimony of Heaven, that who he is<br />
Thenceforth the Nations may not doubt; I saw<br />

The Prophet do him reverence; on him rising<span class="line" id="line80"> [ 80 ]</span><br />
Out of the water, <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span> above the Clouds<br />
Unfold her <a href="" id="crystal" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Chrystal">Crystal</span> <span class="varspell" title="Doors">Dores</span></a>, thence on his head<br />
<a href="" id="perfect" class="annotBtn">A perfect Dove</a> descend, what <span class="varspell" title="ever">e're</span> it meant,<br />
And out of <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span> the <span class="varspell" title="Sovereign">Sov'raign</span> voice I heard,<br />

This is my Son <span class="varspell" title="beloved">belov'd</span>, in him am <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span>.<span class="line" id="line85"> [ 85 ]</span><br />
His Mother then is mortal, but his Sire<br />
He who <a href="" id="obtains" class="annotBtn">obtains</a> the Monarchy of <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span>,<br />
And what will he not do to advance his Son?<br />
His <a href="" id="begot" class="annotBtn">first-<span class="varspell" title="begotten">begot</span></a> we know, and sore have felt,<br />

When his fierce thunder drove us to the deep;<span class="line" id="line90"> [ 90 ]</span><br />
Who this is we must learn, for man he seems<br />
In all his lineaments, though in his face<br />
The glimpses of his <span class="varspell" title="Father's">Fathers</span> glory shine.<br />
Ye see our danger on the utmost edge<br />

Of hazard, which admits no long debate,<span class="line" id="line95"> [ 95 ]</span><br />
But must with something sudden be <span class="varspell" title="opposed">oppos'd</span>,<br />
Not force, but well <a href="" id="couch" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="couched">couch't</span></a> fraud, well-woven snares,<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Ere">E're</span> in the head of Nations he appear<br />
Their King, their Leader, and <span class="varspell" title="Supreme">Supream</span> on Earth.<br />

I, when no other durst, <a href="" id="hundred" class="annotBtn">sole undertook</a><span class="line" id="line100"> [ 100 ]</span><br />
The dismal expedition to find out<br />
And <span class="varspell" title="ruin">ruine</span> <span class="mi">Adam</span>, and the exploit <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</q><br />
Successfully; a calmer voyage now<br />
Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once<br />

Induces best to hope of like success.<span class="line" id="line105"> [ 105 ]</span></p>
<p>He ended, and his words impression left<br />
Of much amazement to <span class="varspell" title="the">th'</span> infernal Crew,<br />
Distracted and <span class="varspell" title="surprised">surpriz'd</span> with deep dismay<br />
At these sad tidings;  but no time was then<br />

For long indulgence to their fears or grief:<span class="line" id="line110"> [ 110 ]</span><br />
Unanimous they all commit the care<br />
And management of this main enterprize<br />
To him, their great <a href="" id="dictator" class="annotBtn">Dictator</a>, whose attempt<br />
At first against mankind so well had <span class="varspell" title="thrived">thriv'd</span><br />

In <span class="mi">Adam's</span> overthrow, and led <span class="varspell"  title="their">thir</span> march<span class="line" id="line115"> [ 115 ]</span><br />
From Hell's deep-vaulted Den to dwell in light,<br />
Regents and Potentates, and Kings, <a href="" id="records" class="annotBtn">yea gods</a><br />
Of many a pleasant Realm and Province wide.<br />
So to the Coast of <span class="mi">Jordan</span> he directs<br />

His <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> steps, <a href="" id="ironic" class="annotBtn">girded with snaky wiles</a>,<span class="line" id="line120"> [ 120 ]</span><br />
Where he might likeliest find this new-<span class="varspell" title="declared">declar'd</span>,<br />
This <a href="" id="man" class="annotBtn">man</a> of men, attested Son of God,<br />
Temptation and all guile on him to try,<br />
So to subvert whom he suspected <span class="varspell" title="raised">rais'd</span><br />

To end his <span class="varspell" title="Reign">Raign</span> on Earth so long <span class="varspell" title="enjoyed">enjoy'd</span>:<span class="line" id="line125"> [ 125 ]</span><br />
But contrary <a href="" id="unweeting" class="annotBtn">unweeting</a> he <span class="varspell" title="fulfilled">fulfill'd</span><br />

Of the most High, who in <a href="" id="full" class="annotBtn">full frequence</a> bright<br />
Of Angels, thus to <a href="" id="gabriel" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Gabriel</span></a> smiling spake.
</p>
<p>
<span class="mi">Gabriel</span>, this day by proof thou shalt behold,<span class="line" id="line130"> [ 130 ]</span><br />
Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth<br />
With man or <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span> affairs, how I begin<br />
To <span class="varspell" title="verify">verifie</span> that solemn message late,<br />
On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure<br />

In <span class="mi">Galilee</span>, that she should bear a Son<span class="line" id="line135"> [ 135 ]</span><br />
Great in Renown, and <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> the Son of God;<br />
Then <span class="varspell" title="toldest">toldst</span> her doubting how these things could be<br />
To her a Virgin, that on her should come<br />
The Holy Ghost, and the power of the highest<br />

<span class="varspell" title="Over">O're</span>-shadow her: this man born and now <a href="" id="lines" class="annotBtn">upgrown</a>,<span class="line" id="line140"> [ 140 ]</span><br />
To <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> him worthy of his birth divine<br />
And high prediction, henceforth I expose<br />
To Satan; let him tempt and now assay<br />
His utmost <span class="varspell" title="subtlety">subtilty</span>, because he boasts<br />

And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng<span class="line" id="line145"> [ 145 ]</span><br />
Of his <a href="" id="apostasy" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Apostasy">Apostasie</span></a>; he might have <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span><br />
Less over-weening, since <a href="" id="job" class="annotBtn">he <span class="varspell" title="failed">fail'd</span> in <span class="mi">Job</span>,</a><br />
Whose constant perseverance overcame<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Whatever">Whate're</span> his cruel malice could invent.<br />

He now shall know I can produce a man,<span class="line" id="line150"> [ 150 ]</span><br />
Of female Seed, far abler to resist<br />
All his <span class="varspell" title="solicitations">sollicitations</span>, and at length<br />
All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell,<br />
Winning by Conquest what the first man lost<br />

<a href="" id="fallacy" class="annotBtn">By fallacy <span class="varspell" title="surprised">surpriz'd</span>.</a>   But first I mean<span class="line" id="line155"> [ 155 ]</span><br />
To exercise him in the Wilderness,<br />
There he shall first lay down the rudiments<br />
Of his great warfare, <span class="varspell" title="ere">e're</span> I send him forth<br />
To conquer <a href="" id="sin" class="annotBtn">Sin and Death</a> the two grand foes,<br />

By Humiliation and strong Sufferance:<span class="line" id="line160"> [ 160 ]</span><br />
His <a href="" id="translates" class="annotBtn">weakness shall <span class="varspell" title="overcome">o'recome</span></a> Satanic strength<br />
And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;<br />
That all the Angels and <span class="varspell" title="Ethereal">&AElig;thereal</span> Powers,<br />
They now, and men hereafter may discern,<br />

From what consummate <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> I have chose<span class="line" id="line165"> [ 165 ]</span><br />
This perfect Man, <a href="" id="defining" class="annotBtn">by merit</a> <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> my Son,<br />
To earn Salvation for the Sons of men.</p>
<p>
So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven<br />
Admiring stood a space, then into Hymns<br />

Burst forth, and in Celestial measures <span class="varspell" title="moved">mov'd</span>,<span class="line" id="line170"> [ 170 ]</span><br />
Circling the Throne and Singing, while <a href="" id="hand" class="annotBtn">the hand</a><br />

<p>
Victory and triumph to the Son of God<br />
Now <span class="varspell" title="entering">entring</span> <a href="" id="duel" class="annotBtn">his great duel</a>, not of arms,<br />

But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles.<span class="line" id="line175"> [ 175 ]</span><br />

How best the mighty work he might begin<br />
Of <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> to mankind, and which way first<br />
Publish his God-like office now mature,<br />
One day forth <span class="varspell" title="walked">walk'd</span> alone, the Spirit leading;<br />

And his deep thoughts, the better to converse<span class="line" id="line190"> [ 190 ]</span><br />
With solitude, till far from track of men,<br />
<a name="swarm">Thought</a> following thought, and step by step led on,<br />
He <span class="varspell" title="entered">entred</span> now the bordering Desert wild,<br />

His holy Meditations thus <span class="varspell" title="pursued">pursu'd</span>.<span class="line" id="line195"> [ 195 ]</span></p>
<p>
O what a multitude of thoughts at once<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Awakened">Awakn'd</span> in me <a href="" id="swarm" class="annotBtn">swarm</a>, while I consider<br />
What from within I feel my self, and hear<br />

Ill <a href="" id="sort" class="annotBtn">sorting</a> with my present state <span class="varspell" title="compared">compar'd</span>.<span class="line" id="line200"> [ 200 ]</span><br />
When I was yet <a href="" id="child" class="annotBtn">a child</a>, no childish play<br />

What might be <span class="varspell" title="public ">publick</span> good; my self I thought<br />

Born to that end, born to promote all truth,<span class="line" id="line205"> [ 205 ]</span><br />
All righteous things: therefore above my years,<br />
The Law of God I read, and found it sweet,<br />
Made it my whole <a href="" id="delight" class="annotBtn">delight</a>, and in it grew<br />
To such perfection, that <span class="varspell" title="ere">e're</span> yet my age<br />

Had <span class="varspell" title="measured">measur'd</span> twice six years, at our great Feast<span class="line" id="line210"> [ 210 ]</span><br />
I went into the Temple, there to hear<br />
The <a href="" id="teacher" class="annotBtn">Teachers of our Law</a>, and to propose<br />
What might improve my knowledge or their own;<br />
And was <a href="" id="admire" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="admired">admir'd</span></a> by all: yet this not all<br />

To which my Spirit <span class="varspell" title="aspired">aspir'd</span>; victorious deeds<span class="line" id="line215"> [ 215 ]</span><br />
<span class="varspell" title="Flamed">Flam'd</span> in my heart, heroic acts; one while<br />
To rescue <span class="mi">Israel</span> from the <span class="mi">Roman</span> yoke,<br />
Then to subdue and quell <span class="varspell" title="over">o're</span> all the earth<br />
Brute violence and proud <span class="varspell" title="Tyrannic">Tyrannick</span> <span class="varspell" title="power">pow'r</span>,<br />

Till truth were freed, and equity <span class="varspell" title="restored">restor'd</span>:<span class="line" id="line220"> [ 220 ]</span><br />
Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first<br />
By winning words to conquer willing hearts,<br />
And make <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> do the work of fear;<br />
At least to try, and teach the erring Soul<br />

Not wilfully mis-doing, but <span class="varspell"  title="unaware">unware</span><span class="line" id="line225"> [ 225 ]</span><br />
Misled; the stubborn only to <a href="" id="subdue" class="annotBtn">subdue</a>.<br />
These growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving<br />
By words at times cast forth inly <span class="varspell" title="rejoiced">rejoyc'd</span>,<br />
And said to me apart, high are thy thoughts<br />

O Son, but nourish them and let them soar<span class="line" id="line230"> [ 230 ]</span><br />
To what <span class="varspell" title="height">highth</span> sacred <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> and true worth<br />
Can raise them, though above example high;<br />
By matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire.<br />
For know, thou art no Son of mortal man;<br />

Though men esteem thee low of Parentage,<span class="line" id="line235"> [ 235 ]</span><br />
Thy Father is the Eternal King, who rules<br />
All Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of men,<br />
A messenger from God <span class="varspell" title="foretold">fore-told</span> thy birth<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Conceived">Conceiv'd</span> in me a Virgin; he <span class="varspell" title="foretold">fore-told</span><br />

And of <a href="" id="kingdom" class="annotBtn">thy Kingdom</a> there <a href="" id="should" class="annotBtn">should</a> be no end.<br />
At thy Nativity a glorious <span class="varspell" title="Choir">Quire</span><br />
Of Angels in the fields of <span class="mi">Bethlehem</span> sung<br />
To Shepherds watching at their folds by night,<br />

And told them the Messiah now was born,<span class="line" id="line245"> [ 245 ]</span><br />
Where they might see him, and to thee they came,<br />
Directed to the Manger where thou <span class="varspell" title="layest">lais't</span>;<br />
For in the Inn was left no better room:<br />
A Star, not seen before in Heaven appearing<br />

Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,<span class="line" id="line250"> [ 250 ]</span><br />
To <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold,<br />
By whose bright course led on they found the place,<br />
Affirming it thy Star, <a href="" id="new" class="annotBtn">new <span class="varspell" title="graven">grav'n</span></a> in Heaven,<br />
By which they knew <a href="" id="thee" class="annotBtn">thee</a> <a href="" id="matt" class="annotBtn">King of <span class="mi">Israel</span> born</a>.<br />

By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake<br />
Before the Altar and the vested Priest,<br />
Like things of thee to all that present stood.<br />
This having heard, <span class="varspell" title="straight">strait</span> I again <a href="" id="revolve" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="revolved">revolv'd</span></a><br />

The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ<span class="line" id="line260"> [ 260 ]</span><br />
Concerning the Messiah, to our Scribes<br />
Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake<br />
I am; this chiefly, that my way must lie<br />
Through many a hard <a href="" id="assay" class="annotBtn">assay</a> even to the death,<br />

<span class="varspell" title="Ere">E're</span> I the <span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span> Kingdom can attain,<span class="line" id="line265"> [ 265 ]</span><br />

Full weight must be <a href="" id="apply" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="transferred">transferr'd</span> upon my head</a>.<br />
Yet neither thus <span class="varspell" title="disheartened">disheartn'd</span> or <span class="varspell" title="dismayed">dismay'd</span>,<br />
The time <span class="varspell" title="prefixed">prefixt</span> I waited, when behold<br />

The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard,<span class="line" id="line270"> [ 270 ]</span><br />
Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come<br />
Before Messiah and <a href="" id="mark" class="annotBtn">his way prepare</a>.<br />
I as all others to his Baptism came,<br />
Which I <span class="varspell" title="believed">believ'd</span> was from above; but he<br />

<span class="varspell" title="Straight">Strait</span> knew me, and with loudest voice <span class="varspell" title="proclaimed">proclaim'd</span><span class="line" id="line275"> [ 275 ]</span><br />
Me him (for it was <span class="varspell" title="shown">shew'n</span> him so from Heaven)<br />
Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Refused">Refus'd</span> on me his Baptism to confer,<br />
As much his greater, and was <a href="" id="hardly" class="annotBtn">hardly won</a>;<br />

But as I rose out of the <a href="" id="laving" class="annotBtn">laving</a> stream,<span class="line" id="line280"> [ 280 ]</span><br />
Heaven <span class="varspell" title="opened">open'd</span> her <a href="" id="eternal" class="annotBtn">eternal doors</a>, from whence<br />
The Spirit descended on me like a <a name="dove">Dove</a>,<br />
And last the sum of all, my Father's voice,<br />
Audibly heard from <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span>, <span class="varspell" title="pronounced">pronounc'd</span> me his,<br />

Me his beloved Son, in whom alone<span class="line" id="line285"> [ 285 ]</span><br />
He was well <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span>; by which I knew the time<br />
Now full, that I no more should live obscure,<br />
But openly begin, as best becomes<br />
The Authority which I <span class="varspell" title="derived">deriv'd</span> from Heaven.<br />

And now by some <a href="" id="motion" class="annotBtn">strong motion</a> I am led<span class="line" id="line290"> [ 290 ]</span><br />
Into this Wilderness, to what intent<br />
I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know;<br />
For what concerns <a href="" id="belief" class="annotBtn">my knowledge</a> God reveals.
</p>
<p>
So spake <a href="" id="star" class="annotBtn">our Morning Star</a> then in his rise,<br />

And looking round on every side beheld<span class="line" id="line295"> [ 295 ]</span><br />
A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades;<br />
The way he came not having <span class="varspell" title="marked">mark'd</span>, return<br />
Was difficult, by <a href="" id="humane" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span></a> steps untrod;<br />
And he still on was led, but with such thoughts<br />

Accompanied of things past and to come<span class="line" id="line300"> [ 300 ]</span><br />
<span class="varspell" title="Lodged">Lodg'd</span> in his <span class="varspell" title="breast">brest</span>, as well might recommend<br />
Such solitude before choicest Society.<br />
Full forty days he <span class="varspell" title="passed">pass'd</span>, whether on hill<br />
Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night<br />

Under the <a href="" id="covert" class="annotBtn">covert</a> of some ancient Oak,<span class="line" id="line305"> [ 305 ]</span><br />
Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew,<br />

Nor tasted <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> food, nor hunger felt<br />
Till those days ended, <span class="varspell" title="hungered">hunger'd</span> then at last<br />

Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild,<span class="line" id="line310"> [ 310 ]</span><br />
Nor sleeping him nor waking <span class="varspell" title="harmed">harm'd</span>, his walk<br />

But now an <a href="" id="weed" class="annotBtn">aged man in Rural weeds</a>,<br />

Following, as <span class="varspell" title="seemed">seem'd</span>, the quest of some stray Ewe,<span class="line" id="line315"> [ 315 ]</span><br />
Or <span class="varspell" title="withered">wither'd</span> sticks to gather; which might serve<br />
Against a <span class="varspell" title="Winter's">Winters</span> day when winds blow keen,<br />
To warm him wet <span class="varspell" title="returned">return'd</span> from field at Eve,<br />
He saw approach; who first with curious eye<br />

<span class="varspell" title="Perused">Perus'd</span> him, then with words thus <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utt'red</span> spake.<span class="line" id="line320"> [ 320 ]</span>
</p>
<p>
Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place<br />
So far from path or road of men, who pass<br />
In Troop or Caravan, for single none<br />
Durst ever, who <span class="varspell" title="returned">return'd</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="dropped">dropt</span> not here<br />

His Carcass, <a href="" id="pine" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="pined">pin'd</span></a> with hunger and with <span class="varspell" title="drought">droughth</span>?<span class="line" id="line325"> [ 325 ]</span><br />
I ask the rather, and the more <a href="" id="wonder" class="annotBtn">admire</a>,<br />
For that to me thou <span class="varspell" title="seemest">seem'st</span> the man, whom late<br />
Our new <span class="varspell" title="baptising">baptizing</span> Prophet at the Ford<br />

To Town or Village nigh (nighest is far)<br />
Where <a href="" id="ought" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="aught">ought</span></a> we hear, and curious are to hear,<br />
What <span class="varspell" title="happens">happ'ns</span> new; <a href="" id="fame" class="annotBtn">Fame</a> also finds us out.

<p>
To whom the Son of God.    Who brought me hither<span class="line" id="line335"> [ 335 ]</span><br />
Will bring me hence, no other Guide I seek.</p>
<p>
By Miracle he may, <span class="varspell" title="replied">reply'd</span> the Swain,<br />
What other way I see not, for we here<br />
Live on tough roots and <a href="" id="stubs" class="annotBtn">stubs</a>, to thirst <span class="varspell" title="inured">inur'd</span><br />

More <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Camel, and to drink go far,<span class="line" id="line340"> [ 340 ]</span><br />

With Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.<span class="line" id="line345"> [ 345 ]</span></p>

He ended, and the Son of God <span class="varspell" title="replied">reply'd</span>.<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Thinkest">Think'st</span> thou such force in Bread?  is it not written<br />

To <a href="" id="prove" class="annotBtn">prove</a> him, and illustrate his high worth;<span class="line" id="line370"> [ 370 ]</span><br />
And when to all his Angels he <span class="varspell" title="proposed">propos'd</span><br />
To draw the proud King <a href="" id="ahabl" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ahab</span></a> into fraud<br />
That he might fall in <span class="mi">Ramoth</span>, they <a href="" id="demur" class="annotBtn">demurring</a>,<br />

For what he bids I do;  though I have lost<br />

To be <span class="varspell" title="beloved">belov'd</span> of God, I have not lost<br />

Never did wrong or violence, by them<br />

Small consolation then, were Man <span class="varspell" title="adjoined">adjoyn'd</span>:<br />
This wounds me most (what can it less) that Man,<br />

What but thy malice <span class="varspell" title="moved">mov'd</span> thee to misdeem<br />

The other service was thy chosen task,<br />
To be a <span class="varspell" title="liar">lyer</span> in <a href="" id="hab" class="annotBtn">four hundred mouths</a>;<br />

Yet thou <span class="varspell" title="pretendest">pretend'st</span> to truth; all Oracles<span class="line" id="line430"> [ 430 ]</span><br />

Among the Nations?  That hath been thy craft,<br />
By mixing somewhat true to vent more <span class="varspell" title="lies">lyes</span>.<br />
But what have been thy answers, what but dark<br />

Ambiguous and with double sense deluding,<span class="line" id="line435"> [ 435 ]</span><br />
Which they who <span class="varspell" title="asked">ask'd</span> have seldom understood,<br />

And <a href="" id="ancient" class="annotBtn">run not sooner</a> to his fatal snare?<br />
For God hath justly <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> the Nations up<br />
To thy Delusions; justly, since they fell<br />
Idolatrous; but when his purpose is<br />

Among them to declare his Providence<span class="line" id="line445"> [ 445 ]</span><br />
To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,<br />
But from him, or his Angels <a href="" id="bush" class="annotBtn">President</a><br />
In every Province, who themselves disdaining<br />
To approach thy Temples, give thee in command<br />

What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say<span class="line" id="line450"> [ 450 ]</span><br />
To thy Adorers;  thou with trembling fear,<br />

Then to thyself <span class="varspell" title="ascribest">ascrib'st</span> the truth <span class="varspell" title="foretold">fore-told</span>.<br />
But this thy glory shall be soon <span class="varspell" title="retrenched">retrench'd</span>;<br />

No more shalt thou by oracling abuse<span class="line" id="line455"> [ 455 ]</span><br />
The Gentiles; henceforth <a href="" id="ceased" class="annotBtn">Oracles are <span class="varspell" title="ceased">ceast</span></a>,<br />

Shalt be <span class="varspell" title="inquired">enquir'd</span> <a href="" id="delphi" class="annotBtn">at <span class="mi">Delphos</span></a> or elsewhere,<br />
At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.<br />

God hath now sent his living Oracle<span class="line" id="line460"> [ 460 ]</span><br />
Into the World, to teach his final will,<br />
And sends his <a href="" id="me" class="annotBtn">Spirit of Truth</a> henceforth to dwell<br />
In pious Hearts, <a href="" id="oracle" class="annotBtn">an inward Oracle</a><br />
To all truth requisite for men to know.

So spake our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>; but the subtle Fiend,<span class="line" id="line465"> [ 465 ]</span><br />
Though inly stung with anger and disdain,<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Dissembled">Dissembl'd</span>, and this Answer smooth <span class="varspell" title="returned">return'd</span>.
</p>
<p>
Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,<br />
And <span class="varspell" title="urged">urg'd</span> me hard with doings, which not will<br />

But misery hath <a href="" id="rested" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="wrested">rested</span></a> from me; where<span class="line" id="line470"> [ 470 ]</span><br />
Easily canst thou find one miserable,<br />
And not <span class="varspell" title="enforced">inforc'd</span> oft-times to part from truth;<br />
If it may stand him more in stead to <span class="varspell" title="lie">lye</span>,<br />
Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?<br />

But thou art <span class="varspell" title="placed">plac't</span> above me, thou art Lord;<span class="line" id="line475"> [ 475 ]</span><br />
From thee I can and must submiss endure<br />
Check or reproof, and glad to <span class="varspell" title="escape">scape</span> so <a href="" id="quit" class="annotBtn">quit</a>.<br />
Hard are the ways of truth, and <a href="" id="rough" class="annotBtn">rough to walk</a>,<br />
Smooth on the tongue <span class="varspell" title="discoursed">discourst</span>, pleasing to <span class="varspell" title="the">th'</span> ear,<br />

And <a href="" id="tune" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="tunable">tuneable</span></a> as Silvan Pipe or Song;<span class="line" id="line480"> [ 480 ]</span><br />
What wonder then if I delight to hear<br />
Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Virtue">Vertue</span>, who follow not her lore: permit me<br />
To hear thee when I come (since no man comes)<br />

And talk at least, though I despair to attain.<span class="line" id="line485"> [ 485 ]</span><br />
Thy <a name="line486">Father</a>, who is holy, wise and pure,<br />
Suffers the Hypocrite or <a href="" id="atheous" class="annotBtn">Atheous</a> Priest<br />
To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister<br />
About his Altar, handling holy things,<br />

Praying or vowing, and <span class="varspell" title="vouchsafed">vouchsaf'd</span> his voice<span class="line" id="line490"> [ 490 ]</span><br />
To <a href="" id="bal" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Balaam</span></a> Reprobate, a Prophet yet<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Inspired">Inspir'd</span>; disdain not such access to me.
</p>
<p>
To whom our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> with <span class="varspell" title="unaltered">unalter'd</span> brow.<br />
Thy coming hither, though I know thy <a href="" id="scope" class="annotBtn">scope</a>,<br />

I bid not or forbid; do as thou <span class="varspell" title="findest">find'st</span><span class="line" id="line495"> [ 495 ]</span><br />
Permission from above; <a href="" id="canst" class="annotBtn">thou canst not more</a>.
</p>
<p>
He added not; and Satan bowing low<br />
His gray dissimulation, <span class="varspell" title="disappeared">disappear'd</span><br />
<a href="" id="air" class="annotBtn">Into thin Air</a> <span class="varspell" title="diffused">diffus'd</span>: for now began<br />

Night with her <a href="" id="sullen" class="annotBtn">sullen wing</a> to <a href="" id="shade" class="annotBtn">double-shade</a><span class="line" id="line500"> [ 500 ]</span><br />
The Desert; Fowls in <span class="varspell"  title="their">thir</span> clay nests were <span class="varspell" title="couched">couch't</span>;<br />
And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.</p>
