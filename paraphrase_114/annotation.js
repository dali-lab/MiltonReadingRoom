Milton may well have studied some Hebrew at St Paul\'s, but he relies heavily here on contemporary translations in both English and Latin (see the <a href=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=PS%20114&amp;version=9;&amp;version=9;\" target=\"main\">Authorized Version of 1611</a> and <a href=\"vulgate.shtml\" target=\"main\">Jerome\'s Vulgate</a>).  Milton later (probably November 1634) <a href=\"../sylvarum/psalm_114/greek.shtml\" target=\"main\">translated this psalm into Greek.</a>  Susan Snyder and others have noted how much Milton owes to Joshua Sylvester\'s style in his translations of DuBartas (<a href=\"../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#sylbartas\" target=\"main\">Snyder</a> 1. 83).</span>",
