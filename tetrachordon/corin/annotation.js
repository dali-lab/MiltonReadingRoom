var annotList = {"introduction":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i> <br><imgsrc=\"../../resources/dot_clear.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"8\">This fourth note in the scale of Milton\'s attempt to create a harmony among the Scripture passages on divorce focuses on chapter seven of Paul\'s first letter to the Corinthians.  Milton begins the section with Paul\'s statement in verses 10 and 11 that the Lord prohibits divorce.  After a short passage describing how reason sometimes departs from love, especially from conjugal love with its dependence not only on moral but also on natural causes, Milton claims that Paul prohibits divorce only for \"<a href=\"text.shtml#intro6\" target=\"text\">those</a> maried who differ not in religion.\"  Milton then moves on to a much more extensive look into verses 12 through 16, which deal with marriages between a believer and a nonbeliever.  Despite Paul\'s recommendations that believers stay unified with infidel spouses in verses 12 through 14, Milton focuses especially on verse 15 with its inclusive phrase \"<a href=\"text.shtml#intro4\" target=\"text\">A brother</a> or a sister is not under bondage in such cases.\"  By arguing that this plural \"such cases\" includes \"<a href=\"text.shtml#intro5\" target=\"text\">bondage</a> to any hainous default against the main ends of matrimony,\" Milton concludes the following:<blockquote><a href=\"text.shtml#intro1\" target=\"text\">That</a> man or wife who hates in wedloc, is perpetually unsociable, unpeacefull, or unduteous, either not being able, or not willing to performe what the maine ends of mariage demand in helpe and solace...is worse then an infidel... The blamelesse person therfore hath as good a plea to sue out his delivery from this bondage, as from the desertion of an infidel.</blockquote>Crucial to Milton\'s argument is his stance that society of mind and spirit is the main end of marriage rather than the more traditionally favored ends of procreation and a solution to lustful burnings.  <br><imgsrc=\"../../resources/dot_clear.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"8\"> Milton\'s methods of commentary are less formal than traditional commentaries.  Rarely does he analyze the linguistics or follow the literal exposition of the text by disputations, questions, or problems in the scholastic manner; nor does he use moral or allegorical interpretations to preach to the reader.  According to the editors of the Yale <a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#Yale\" target=\"main\"><i>Complete Prose Works,</i></a> these deviations from the traditional commentaries are to be explained by Milton\'s desire to interpret the texts not from all points of view, but only from his point of view (572). <br><imgsrc=\"../../resources/dot_clear.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"8\">After completing his exegesis of 1 Corinthians 7, Milton sets out to answer those who depend on the opinion of authorities in order to be persuaded.  With a parade of Early Church fathers, other theologians, and legal theorists, Milton recreates his argument using pieces of the arguments of other scholars.  The church fathers are cited for evidence as to the practice of the primitive church in regard to divorce.  When it was framed or sanctioned by Christian emperors, Milton uses Roman law as further evidence of what was approved by leaders of the church.  Few of these scholars are in complete agreement with Milton, and it is often difficult to know when Milton is citing a source as support to one component of his argument or as support to his argument as a whole.  According to the editors of the Yale <a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#Yale\" target=\"main\"><i>Complete Prose Works,</i></a> only Erasmus, Bucer, Luther, and Melancthon support Milton\'s main argument in full (573).  <br><imgsrc=\"../../resources/dot_clear.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"8\">Milton shows that his proposal of divorce for incompatibility has some precedent in a few Protestant treatises, although he also claims that he is \"<a href=\"text.shtml#intro2\" target=\"text\">somthing first</a>\" in producing such a complete analysis of the subject.  He strongly denies that the authorities that he has cited have influenced him: <blockquote><a href=\"text.shtml#intro3\" target=\"text\">God,</a> I solemnly attest him, withheld from my knowledge the consenting judgement of these men so late, untill they could not bee my instructers, but only my unexpected witnesses to partial men.</blockquote> <imgsrc=\"../../resources/dot_clear.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"8\">Milton\'s use of quotations needs some explaining to the modern reader.  Milton considers that all reasonable requirements have been met when he reproduces the sense of the author he is quoting (<a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#Yale\" target=\"main\">Wolfe</a> 574).  The use of italics in this text cannot be assumed to be equivalent to our modern use of quotation marks.  In the process of translating his sources from Latin, Milton also omits and rearranges components of the source being cited.  Although he usually uses the King James Version (The Authorized Version), Milton sometimes takes the liberty of using his own translation of Scripture from Hebrew or Greek to better fit his argument; these occasions are noted in the annotations.   <br><imgsrc=\"../../resources/dot_clear.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"8\">It is important to note that Milton\'s exegesis is dominated by his humanist belief in the supreme power of reason, even when it comes in conflict with Scripture.  This belief has led Milton to adopt controversial beliefs in Monism, Arminian views against predestination, and Arian views against the Trinity.  Many people, both in his time and in more contemporary times, have pegged Milton as a heretic for his unorthodox theology (<a href=\"../../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#dobranski_rumrich\" target=\"main\">Dobranski and Rumrich</a>). <i> Geoffrey Rand Smith II</i><br><imgsrc=\"../../resources/dot_clear.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" hspace=\"8\"></span>",
