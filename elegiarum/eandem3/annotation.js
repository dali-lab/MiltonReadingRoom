This group of five elegies all focus on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot\" target=\"main\">Gunpowder Plot of 1605</a>. November 5, or Guy Fawkes Day, celebrates the foiling of that plot, as does <a href=\"../../sylvarum/novembris/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"In Quintum Novembris\"</a> (1626). The first three of these elegies are certainly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Day\" target=\"main\">Guy Fawkes Night</a> poems; the fourth, \"In inventorem Bombardae,\" is certainly on a related theme. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England\" target=\"main\">King James I</a> (6th of Scotland) died on 27 March 1625, so the following November 5th celebrations were the first following his death, occasioning much celebration, since he was King when the plot was hatched and foiled.</p><p class=\"next\">In a preface addressed to the \"High and mightie Kings; and Right Excellent free Princes and States of Christendome\" and prefixed to the second edition of <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:9648\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">An Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance</span></a> (London 1609), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England\" target=\"main\">King James I</a> defended himself from the charge of heresy leveled at him by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bellarmine\" target=\"main\">Cardinal Robert Bellarmine</a> and by the Pope.

The humor of this brief elegy depends on an ironic sense of how one might be \"lifted to the stars\"&mdash;by a pious and holy life or by an explosion.</span>",
