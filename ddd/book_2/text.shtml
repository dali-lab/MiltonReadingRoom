</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Hitherto"><span class="minitial">H</span>itherto</span> the Position undertaken hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="declared">declar'd</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> by a Law of God, that Law <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> to be moral, and unabolishable for many reasons equal, honest, charitable, just, <span class="varspell" title="annexed">annext</span> <span class="varspell" title="thereto">therto</span>. It follows now that those places of Scripture which have a seeming to revoke the prudence of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, or rather that <span class="varspell" title="merciful">mercifull</span> decree of God, be forthwith <span class="varspell" title="explained">explain'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="reconciled">reconcil'd</span>. For what are all these reasonings worth, will some reply, whenas the <a href="" id="words" class="annotBtn">words of Christ</a> are plainly against all divorce, except <span class="mi">in case of fornication</span>. To whom he whose <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> were to answer no more but this, <span class="mi">except also in case of charity</span>, might safely appeal to the more plain words of Christ in defence of so excepting. <span class="mi">Thou shalt <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> no manner of <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span></span> saith the commandment of the Sabbath. Yes <a href="" id="saith" class="annotBtn">saith Christ</a> works of charity. And shall we be more severe in paraphrasing the <span class="varspell" title="considerate">considerat</span> and tender Gospel, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he was in expounding the rigid and peremptory Law? What was ever in all appearance <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> made for man, and <a href="" id="alone" class="annotBtn">more for God alone</a> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Sabbath? yet when the good of man comes into the scales, we hear that voice of infinite <span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnesse</span> and benignity that <span class="mi">Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath</span>. What thing ever was <a href="" id="made" class="annotBtn">more made for Man</a> alone and <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> for God <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>? And shall we load it with a cruel and <span class="varspell" title="senseless">senceles</span> bondage utterly against both the good of man and the glory of God? Let who so will now listen, I want neither <a href="" id="pall" class="annotBtn">pall nor <span class="varspell" title="miter">mitre</span></a>, I stay neither for ordination <a href="" id="nor" class="annotBtn">nor</a> induction, but in the firm faith of a knowing Christian, which is the best and truest endowment of the <span class="varspell" title="keys">keyes</span>, I pronounce, the man who shall bind so cruelly a good and gracious ordinance of God, hath not in that the Spirit of Christ. Yet that every text of Scripture seeming opposite may be attended with a due exposition, this other part ensues, and makes account to find no slender arguments for this assertion out of those very Scriptures, which are commonly <span class="varspell" title="urged">urg'd</span> against it.
</p>
<p>
First <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> let us remember as a thing not to be <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span>, that all places of Scripture <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> just reason of doubt arises from the letter, are to be expounded by considering upon what occasion every thing is set down: and by comparing other Texts. The occasion which <span class="varspell" title="induced">induc't</span> our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> to speak of divorce, was either to convince the extravagance of the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> in that point, or to give a sharp and vehement answer to a tempting question. And in such cases that we are not to repose all upon the <span class="varspell" title="literal">literall</span> terms of so many words, many instances will teach us: <span class="varspell" title="Wherein">Wherin</span> we may plainly discover how Christ meant not to be <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> word for word, but like a wise Physician, <span class="varspell" title="administering">administring</span> one <span class="varspell" title="excess">excesse</span> against another to reduce us to <a href="" id="mean" class="annotBtn">a perfect mean</a>: Where the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> were strict, there Christ seems <span class="varspell" title="remiss">remisse</span>; where they were too <span class="varspell" title="remiss">remisse</span>, he saw it <span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span> to seem most severe: <a href="" id="one" class="annotBtn">in one place</a> he censures an <span class="varspell" title="unchaste">unchast</span> look to be adultery already committed: <a href="" id="another" class="annotBtn">another time</a> he passes over <span class="varspell" title="actual">actuall</span> adultery with <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> reproof <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> for an <span class="varspell" title="unchaste">unchast</span> look; not so heavily condemning secret <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknes</span>, as open malice: So <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> he may be justly thought to have <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> this rigid sentence against divorce, not to cut off all remedy from a good man who finds himself consuming away in a disconsolate and <span class="varspell" title="uninjoyed">uninjoy'd</span> matrimony, but to lay a bridle upon the bold abuses of those over-weening <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Rabbis">Rabbies</span></span>; which he could not more effectually <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by a countersway of restraint curbing their wild exorbitance almost into the other extreme; as when we bow things the contrary way, to make them come to their <a href="" id="naturall" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> <span class="varspell" title="straitness">straitnesse</span></a>. And that this was the only intention of Christ is most evident; if we attend but to his own words and protestation made in the same Sermon, not many verses before he treats of divorcing, that he came not to abrogate from the Law <a href="" id="jot" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">one jot or tittle</span></a>, and denounces against them that shall so teach.
</p>
<p>
But <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Luke</span>, the verse <span class="varspell" title="immediately">immediatly</span> before going that of divorce inserts the <a href="" id="caveat" class="annotBtn">same caveat</a>, as if the latter could not be understood without the former; and as a <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnesse</span> to produce against this our <span class="varspell" title="willful">wilfull</span> mistake of abrogating, which must needs confirm us that what ever <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> in the political law of more special relation to the Jews might cease to us, yet that of those precepts concerning divorce, not one of them was <span class="varspell" title="repealed">repeal'd</span> by the doctrine of Christ, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> we have <span class="varspell" title="vowed">vow'd</span> not to <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> his own cautious and <span class="varspell" title="immediate">immediat</span> profession; for if these our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> words inveigh against all divorce, and condemn it as adultery, except it be for adultery, and be not rather understood against the abuse of those divorces permitted in the Law, then is that Law of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, <a href="" id="Deut" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 24.1</a>. not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="repealed">repeal'd</span> and wholly <span class="varspell" title="annulled">annull'd</span> against the promise of Christ and his known profession, not to meddle in matters Judicial, but that which is more strange, the very substance and purpose of that Law is contradicted and <a href="" id="convinc" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="convinced">convinc't</span></a> both of injustice and impurity, as having <span class="varspell" title="authorized">authoriz'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintain'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="legal">legall</span> adultery by statute.  <span class="mi">Moses</span> also cannot <span class="varspell" title="escape">scape</span> to be guilty of <span class="varspell" title="unequal">unequall</span> and unwise decrees, punishing one act of secret adultery <a href="" id="death" class="annotBtn">by death</a>, and permitting a whole life of open adultery by Law.  And albeit Lawyers write that some <span class="varspell" title="political">politicall</span> edicts, though not <span class="varspell" title="approved">approv'd</span>, are yet <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> to the scum of the people and the necessity of the times; these excuses have but a weak pulse: for first, we read, not that the scoundrel people, but the choicest, the wisest, the holiest of that nation have frequently <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> these <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span>, or such as these in the best and holiest times. Secondly, be it <span class="varspell" title="yielded">yeelded</span>, that in matters not very bad or impure, a human law giver may slacken something of that which is exactly good, to the disposition of the people and the times: but if the perfect, the pure, the righteous law of God, for so are all his statutes and his <span class="varspell" title="judgments">judgements</span>, be found to have <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> smoothly without any certain <a href="" id="reprehension" class="annotBtn">reprehension</a>, that which Christ afterward declares to be adultery, how can we free this Law from the horrible <span class="varspell" title="indictment">endightment</span> of being both impure, unjust, and fallacious.

<p>
This <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> Text not to be <span class="varspell" title="matched">match't</span> again throughout the whole Scripture, <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> God in his perfect Law should seem to have granted to the hard hearts of his holy people under his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> hand, a <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> immunity and free charter to live and die in a long successive adultery, under a covenant of works, till the <span class="mi">Messiah</span>, and then that indulgent permission to be strictly <span class="varspell" title="denyed">deny'd</span> by a <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> of grace; besides the incoherence of such a doctrine, cannot, must not be thus interpreted, to the raising of a paradox never known til then, <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> hanging by the <span class="varspell" title="twinned">twin'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="thread">thred</span> of one <span class="varspell" title="doubtful">doubtfull</span> Scripture, against so many other rules and leading principles of religion, of justice, and purity of life.  For what could be granted more either to the fear, or to the lust of any tyrant, or politician, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> this authority of <span class="mi">Moses</span> thus expounded; which opens him a way at will to <span class="varspell" title="dam">damme</span> up justice, and not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> to admit of any <span class="mi">Romish</span> or <span class="mi">Austrian</span> <span class="varspell" title="dispenses">dispences</span>, but to enact a statute of that which he dares not <span class="varspell" title="seem">seeme</span> to approve, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to legitimate vice, to make <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>, the ever alien <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> vassal sin, a free Citizen of the Common-wealth, pretending <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> these or these plausible reasons.  And well he might, all the while that <span class="mi">Moses</span> shall be <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alledg'd</span> to have done as much without <span class="varspell" title="showing">shewing</span> any reason at all.  Yet this could not enter into the heart of <span class="mi">David</span>, <a href="" id="Psal" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Psalm">Psal.</abbr></span> 94.20</a>. how any such <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> as <span class="varspell" title="endeavors">endevours</span> <span class="mi">to fashion <span class="varspell" title="wickedness">wickednes</span> by a law</span>, should derive it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> from God. And <a href="" id="Isaiah" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Isaiah</span></a> <span class="varspell" title="lays">layes</span> <span class="mi">woe upon them that decree unrighteous decrees</span>, 10.1.  Now which of these two is the better Lawgiver, and which deserves most a woe, he that gives out an edict singly unjust, or he that confirms to generations a <span class="varspell" title="fixed">fixt</span> and unmolested impunity of that which is not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> held to be unjust, but also unclean, and both in a high degree, not only as they themselves affirm, an injurious expulsion of one wife, but also an unclean freedom by more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a patent to wed another adulterously?  How can we <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> with safety thus dangerously confine the free simplicity of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> meaning to that which <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> amounts from so many letters, whenas it can consist neither with his former and cautionary words, nor with other more pure and holy principles, nor finally with the scope of charity, commanding by his <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> commission in a higher strain.  But all rather of necessity must be understood as only against the abuse of that wise and ingenuous liberty which <span class="mi">Moses</span> gave, and to <span class="varspell" title="terrify">terrifie</span> a <span class="varspell" title="roving">roaving</span> conscience from sinning under that pretext.

<span class="msummary">That to allow sin by Law, is against the <a name="naturallaw">nature</a> of Law, the end of the lawgiver and the good of the people.  Impossible <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> in the Law of God. That it makes God the author of sin, more than any thing objected by the <a href="" id="Iesuits" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Jesuits">Iesuits</span> or Arminians</a> against Predestination</span>.
</p>
<br />
<p class="first">
<a href="" id="BUT" class="annotBtn">But</a> let us yet further <span class="varspell" title="examine">examin</span> upon what consideration a Law of licence could be thus <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> to a holy
people for the <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of heart.  I suppose all <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span>
answer, that for some good end or other.  But here the
contrary shall be <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span>.  First, that many ill effects, but
no good end of such a sufferance can be <span class="varspell" title="shown">shewn</span>; next,
that a thing unlawful can for no good end whatever be
either <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> or <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> by a positive law.  If there were
any good end <span class="varspell" title="aimed">aim'd</span> at, that end was then good, either as
to the Law, or to the lawgiver licencing; or as to the
person <span class="varspell" title="licenced">licenc't</span>.  That it could not be the end of the Law,
whether Moral or <span class="varspell" title="Judicial">Judiciall</span>, to licence a sin, I prove
easily out of <a href="" id="Rom" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr></span> 5. 20</a>.  <span class="mi">The Law <span class="varspell" title="entered">enter'd</span>, that the offence
might abound</span>, that is, that sin might be made
abundantly manifest to be <span class="varspell" title="heinous">hainous</span> and displeasing to
God, that so his <span class="varspell" title="offered">offer'd</span> grace might be the more
<span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteem'd</span>.  Now if the Law in stead of aggravating and
<a href="" id="terrifying" class="annotBtn">terrifying</a> sin, shall give out licence, it foils it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>, and
turns <a href="" id="recreant" class="annotBtn">recreant</a> from its own end: it forestalls the pure
grace of Christ which is through <span class="varspell" title="righteousness">righteousnesse</span>, with
impure indulgences which are through sin. And instead
of discovering sin, for <span class="mi">by the Law is the knowledge <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span></span>
<a href="" id="saithpaul" class="annotBtn">saith <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span></a>, and that by certain and true light for men
to walk in safely, it holds out <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> and <span class="varspell" title="dazzling">dazling</span> fires to
stumble men: or like those miserable flies to run into
with delight and be burnt: for how many <span class="varspell" title="souls">soules</span> might
easily think that to be <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>, which the Law and
Magistrate <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> them? Again we read, <a href="" id="Tim" class="annotBtn">1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1.5</a>.
<span class="mi">The end of the Commandment is charity, out of a pure
heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith <span class="varspell" title="unfeigned">unfained</span></span>.  But
never could that be charity to allow a people what they
could not use with a pure heart, but with conscience and
faith both <span class="varspell" title="deceived">deceiv'd</span>, or <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> <span class="varspell" title="despised">despis'd</span>.  The more particular
end of the Judicial Law is set forth to us clearly, <a href="" id="romans" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr></span>
13</a>. that God hath <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> to that Law <span class="mi">a Sword not in vain,
but to be a terror to evil works, a revenge to execute wrath
upon him that doth evil</span>.  If this terrible commission
should but <span class="varspell" title="forbear">forbeare</span> to punish <span class="varspell" title="wickedness">wickednes</span>, were it other
to be accounted <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> partial and unjust? but if it begin
to write indulgence to vulgar <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleannes</span>, can it <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>
more to corrupt and shame the end of its own being?
Lastly, if the Law allow sin, it enters into a kind of <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> with sin, and if it <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, there is not a greater sinner in the world <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Law it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>. The Law, to use an allegory <span class="varspell" title="something">somthing</span> different from that in <a href="" id="Philo" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Philo <span class="varspell" title="Judaeus">Jud&aelig;us</span></span></a> concerning <span class="mi">Amaleck</span>, though haply more significant, the Law is the <span class="mi">Israelite</span>, and hath this absolute charge given it, <a href="" id="deuter" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 25</a>. <span class="mi">To blot out the memory of</span> sin, <span class="mi">the Amalekite, from under <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span>, not to forget it</span>.   Again, the Law is the <span class="mi">Israelite</span>, and hath this <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> repeated command <span class="mi">to make no <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> with</span> sin, <span class="mi">the Canaanite</span>, but to <span class="varspell" title="expel">expell</span> him, lest he prove a snare.  And to say truth it were too rigid and <span class="varspell" title="reasonless">reasonlesse</span> to <span class="varspell" title="proclaim">proclaime</span> such an enmity between man and man, were it not the type of a greater enmity between law and sin. I spake <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> now, as if sin were <span class="varspell" title="condemned">condemn'd</span> in a perpetual <a href="" id="villenage" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="villeinage">villenage</span></span></a> never to be free by law, never to be <a href="" id="manumitted" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">manumitted</span></a>: but sure sin can have no tenure by law at all, but is rather an eternal outlaw, and in hostility with law past all <span class="varspell" title="atonement">attonement</span>: both <a href="" id="diagonial" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="diagonal">diagonial</span></span> contraries</a>, as much allowing one another, as day and night together in one hemisphere.  Or if it be possible, that sin with his <span class="varspell" title="darkness">darknes</span> may come to composition, it cannot be without a foul eclipse and <span class="varspell" title="twilight">twylight</span> to the law, whose <span class="varspell" title="brightness">brightnesse</span> ought to <span class="varspell" title="surpass">surpasse</span> the noon.  Thus we see how this unclean permittance defeats the sacred and glorious end both of the Moral and Judicial Law.

As little good can the lawgiver propose to equity by such a lavish <span class="varspell" title="remissness">remisnes</span> as this: if to remedy <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnes</span> of heart, <a href="" id="paraeus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paraeus">Par&aelig;us</span></span></a> and other divines <span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span>, it more <span class="varspell" title="increases">encreases</span> by this liberty, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> is <span class="varspell" title="lessened">lessn'd</span>: and how is it probable that their hearts were more hard in this that it should be <span class="varspell" title="yielded">yeelded</span> to, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in any other crime? Their hearts were <a href="" id="usury" class="annotBtn">set upon usury</a>, and are to this day, no Nation more; yet that which was the <a href="" id="only" class="annotBtn">endammaging only of their estates</a>, was narrowly forbid; this which is thought the extreme injury and <span class="varspell" title="dishonor">dishonour</span> of their Wives and daughters, with the defilement also of themselves, is bounteously <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span>.  Their hearts were as hard under their best Kings <a href="" id="high" class="annotBtn">to offer in high places</a>, though to the true God; yet that but a small thing is strictly <span class="varspell" title="forwarned">forwarn'd</span>; this accounted a high offence against one of the greatest moral duties, is <span class="varspell" title="calmly">calmely</span> permitted and <span class="varspell" title="established">establisht</span>.  How can it be evaded but that the heavy censure of Christ should fall worse upon this lawgiver of theirs, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> upon all the Scribes and <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>?  For they did but omit Judgement and Mercy to trifle in <a href="" id="Mint" class="annotBtn">Mint and Cummin</a>, yet all according to Law; but this their Law-giver, altogether as <span class="varspell" title="punctual">punctuall</span> in such niceties, goes marching on to adulteries, through the violence of divorce by Law against Law.  If it were such a cursed act of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Pilate">Pilat</span></span> a subordinate Judge to <span class="varspell" title="Caesar">C&aelig;sar</span>, over-<span class="varspell" title="swayed">swayd</span> by those hard hearts with much a <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> <a href="" id="suffer" class="annotBtn">to suffer one transgression</a> of Law but once, what is it then with <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> a <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> to publish a Law of transgression for many ages?  Did God for this come down and cover the Mount of <a href="" id="Sinai" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Sinai</span> with his glory</a>, uttering in thunder those his sacred Ordinances out of the <span class="varspell" title="bottomless">bottomlesse</span> treasures of his <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> and <span class="varspell" title="infinite">infinit</span> <span class="varspell" title="pureness">purenes</span> to patch up an ulcerous and <span class="varspell" title="rotten">rott'n</span> common-wealth with strict and stern injunctions, to wash the skin and garments for every unclean touch, and such <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> permission <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> to pollute the <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> with adulteries by <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> authority, without disgrace, or question?  No, it had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> better that man had never known Law or matrimony, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that such foul iniquity should be <span class="varspell" title="fastened">fast'nd</span> upon the holy One of <span class="mi">Israel</span>, the Judge of all the earth, <a name="Belzebub">and</a> such a <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of folly as <a href="" id="Belzebub" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Beelzebub">Belzebub</span></span></a> would not commit, to divide against himself and pervert his own ends; or if he to <span class="varspell" title="compass">compasse</span> more certain mischief, might <span class="varspell" title="yield">yeild</span> perhaps to <span class="varspell" title="feign">fain</span> some good deed, yet that God should enact a licence of certain <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> for uncertain good against His own glory and <span class="varspell" title="pureness">purenes</span>, is abominable to conceive.  And as it is destructive to the end of Law, and blasphemous to the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> of the lawgiver licencing, so is it as pernicious to the person <span class="varspell" title="licenced">licenc't</span>.  If a private friend admonish not, the <a href="" id="perish" class="annotBtn">Scripture saith</a> <span class="mi">he hates his brother, and lets him perish</span>; but if he <span class="varspell" title="soothe">sooth</span> him, and allow him in his faults, the <a href="" id="teach" class="annotBtn">Proverbs teach</a> us <span class="mi">he spreads a net for his <span class="varspell" title="neighbor's">neighbours</span> feet, and worketh ruin</span>.  If the Magistrate or Prince forget to administer due justice and restrain not sin, <a href="" id="Eli" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Eli</span> himself</a> could say, <span class="mi">it made the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> people to <span class="varspell" title="transgress">transgresse</span></span>.  But if he <span class="varspell" title="countenance">count'nance</span> them against law by his own example, what <span class="varspell" title="havoc">havock</span> it makes both in Religion and <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> among the people, may be <span class="varspell" title="guessed">guest</span> by the anger it brought upon <a href="" id="Hophni" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Hophni</span> and <span class="mi">Phineas</span></a>, not to be <span class="varspell" title="appeased">appeas'd</span> <span class="mi">with sacrifice nor <span class="varspell" title="offering">offring</span> for ever</span>.  If the Law be silent to declare sin, the people must needs generally <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> astray, for the <a href="" id="Apostle" class="annotBtn">Apostle <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> saith</a>, <span class="mi">he had not known lust but
by the Law</span>: and surely such a Nation seems not to be
under the illuminating guidance of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> law, but under
the horrible doom rather of such as despise the Gospel,
<a href="" id="filthy" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">he that is filthy let him be filthy still</span></a>.  But where the Law
it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> gives a warrant for sin, I know not what
condition of misery to <span class="varspell" title="imagine">imagin</span> miserable <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> for
such a people, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> that portion of the wicked, or
rather of the damned, on whom God threatens in <a href="" id="11psalm" class="annotBtn">11.
Psalm</a>, <span class="mi">to rain snares</span>: but that <span class="varspell" title="questionless">questionlesse</span> cannot <a href="" id="rom3" class="annotBtn">be</a>
by any Law, which the <a href="" id="paul" class="annotBtn">Apostle saith</a> <span class="mi">is a ministery
<span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span> of God unto our good</span>, and not so many <span class="varspell" title="ways">waies</span> and in so high a degree to our destruction, as we have
now <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> graduating.  And this is all the good can come
to the person <span class="varspell" title="licenced">licenc't</span> in his <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of heart.

I am next to mention that which because it is a ground in divinity, <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>3.  will save the <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> of demonstrating, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> her <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> axioms be more doubted <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in other Arts (although it be no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> firm in the precepts of Philosophy) that a thing <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span> can for no good whatsoever be done, much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> by a positive law.  And this is the <a href="" id="matter" class="annotBtn">matter</a> why Interpreters upon that <a href="" id="passage" class="annotBtn">passage in <span class="mi">Hosea</span></a> will not consent it to be a true story, that the Prophet took a Harlot to wife, because God being a pure Spirit could not command a thing repugnant to his own nature, no not for so good an end as to exhibit more to the life a <span class="varspell" title="wholesome">wholsom</span> and perhaps a converting parable to many an Israelite.  Yet that he commanded the allowance of adulterous and injurious <span class="varspell" title="divorces">divorses</span> for <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnes</span> of heart, a reason obscure and in a wrong sense, they can very <span class="varspell" title="savorily">savourily</span> <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> themselves; so tenacious is the <span class="varspell" title="leaven">leven</span> of an old conceit.  But they shift it, he permitted only.  Yet silence in the Law is consent, and consent is accessory; why then is not the Law being silent, or not active against a crime, accessory to its own conviction, it self judging?  For though we should grant, that it <span class="varspell" title="approves">approvs</span> not, yet it wills; and the <span class="varspell" title="Lawyer's">Lawyers</span> maxim is, that <span class="mi">the will <span class="varspell" title="compelled">compell'd</span> is yet the will</span>.  And though <span class="mi">Aristotle</span> in his <span class="varspell" title="Ethics">Ethicks</span> call this <a href="" id="mixt" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">a <span class="varspell" title="mixed">mixt</span> action</span></a>, yet he concludes it to be voluntary and inexcusable, if it be <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>.  How justly then might human law and Philosophy rise up against the <span class="varspell" title="righteousness">righteousnesse</span> of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, if this be true which our vulgar Divinity Fathers upon him, yea upon God <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>; not silently and only negatively to permit, but in his law to divulge a written and <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span> to commit and persist in <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span> divorces with a high hand, with security and no ill fame: for this is more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> permitting or <a href="" id="conniving" class="annotBtn">conniving</a>, this is maintaining; this is warranting, this is protecting, yea this is doing <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, and such an evil as that <span class="varspell" title="reprobate">reprobat</span> lawgiver did, whose lasting infamy is <span class="varspell" title="ingraven">ingrav'n</span> upon him <a href="" id="surname" class="annotBtn">like a surname</a>, <span class="mi">he who made Israel to sin</span>.  This is the lowest pitch <a href="" id="contrary" class="annotBtn">contrary</a> to God that <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> fraud and injustice can descend.

If it be <span class="varspell" title="affirmed">affirm'd</span> that God as being Lord may <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> what he will; yet we must know that God hath not two wills, but one will, much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> two contrary.  If he once <span class="varspell" title="willed">will'd</span> adultery should be <span class="varspell" title="sinful">sinfull</span>, and to be <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span> by death, all his omnipotence will not allow him to will the allowance that his holiest people might as it were by his own <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Antinomy">Antinomie</span></span>, or counter-statute, live <span class="varspell" title="unreproved">unreprov'd</span> in the same fact, as he <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> <span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteem'd</span> it, according to our common explainers.  The hidden <span class="varspell" title="ways">wayes</span> of his providence we adore <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> search not; but the law is his <span class="varspell" title="revealed">reveled</span> <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span>, his complete, his evident, and certain will; herein he appears to us as it were in human shape, enters into <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> with us, swears to keep it, binds himself like a just lawgiver to his own prescriptions, gives himself to be understood by men, judges and is <span class="varspell" title="judged">judg'd</span>, measures and is <span class="varspell" title="commensurate">commensurat</span> to right reason; cannot require <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> of us in one cantle of his Law <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in another, his <span class="varspell" title="legal">legall</span> justice cannot be so fickle and so variable, sometimes like a <a href="" id="fire1" class="annotBtn">devouring fire</a> and by and by <a href="" id="connivent" class="annotBtn">connivent</a> in the embers, or, if I may so say, <a href="" id="oscitant" class="annotBtn">oscitant</a> and supine.  The vigor of his Law could no more remit, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <a href="" id="fire" class="annotBtn">hallowed fire</a> on his altar could be let <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> out.  The Lamps that burnt before him might need snuffing, but the light of his Law never.  Of this also more beneath, is discussing <a href="" id="solution" class="annotBtn">a solution of <span class="mi">Rivetus</span></a>.

The Jesuits, and that sect among us which is <span class="varspell" title="named">nam'd</span> of <a href="" id="Arminius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Arminius</span></a>, are wont to charge <a href="" id="us" class="annotBtn">us</a> of making God the author of <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> in two degrees especially, not to speak of his permissions.   1. Because we hold that he hath decreed some to <a href="" id="damnation" class="annotBtn">damnation</a>, and consequently to <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>, say they: Next, because those means which are of saving knowledge to others, he makes to them an occasion of greater <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>.  Yet considering the perfection <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> man was created, and might have stood, no decree necessitating his free will, but subsequent though not in time yet in order to causes which were in his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> power, they might, methinks be <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> to absolve both God and us.  Whenas the doctrine of <span class="mi">Plato</span> and <span class="mi">Chrysippus</span> with their followers the <span class="mi">Academics</span> and the <span class="mi">Stoics</span>, who knew not what a <span class="varspell" title="consummate">consummat</span> and most adorned <span class="mi">Pandora</span> was <span class="varspell" title="bestowed">bestow'd</span> upon <span class="mi">Adam</span> to be the nurse and guide of his arbitrary <span class="varspell" title="happiness">happinesse</span> and perseverance, I mean his native innocence and perfection, which might have kept him from being our true <a href="" id="Epimetheus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Epimetheus</span></a>, and though they taught of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> and vice to be both the gift of <span class="mi">divine destiny</span>, they could yet find reasons not invalid, to <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> the counsels of God and Fate from the <a href="" id="insulsity" class="annotBtn">insulsity</a> of <span class="varspell" title="mortal">mortall</span> tongues: That <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> own will self corrupted is the <span class="varspell" title="adequate">adequat</span> and sufficient cause of his disobedience <span class="mi">besides fate</span>; as <span class="mi">Homer</span> also wanted not to <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> both in his <span class="mi">Iliad</span> and <span class="mi">Odyssei</span>.  And <span class="mi">Manilius</span> the Poet, although in his fourth book he tells of some <span class="mi">created both to <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> and punishment</span>; yet without murmuring, and with an industrious <span class="varspell" title="cheerfulness">cheerfulnes</span> <span class="varspell" title="acquits">acquitts</span> the <span class="mi">Deity</span>.  They were not ignorant in their heathen lore, that it is most God-like to punish those who of his creatures became his enemies with the greatest punishment; and they could attain also to think that the greatest, when God <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> throws a man furthest from him; which then they held <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> did, when he blinded, <span class="varspell" title="hardened">hard'n'd</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="stirred">stirr'd</span> up his offendors, to finish, and pile up their <span class="varspell" title="disparate">disperat</span> work since they had <span class="varspell" title="undertaken">undertak'n</span> it.  To banish for ever into a <span class="varspell" title="local">locall</span> hell, whether in the <span class="varspell" title="air">aire</span> or in the center, or in that uttermost and <span class="varspell" title="bottomless">bottomlesse</span> gulph of <span class="mi">Chaos</span>, deeper from holy <span class="varspell" title="bliss">blisse</span> then the <span class="varspell" title="world's">worlds</span> diameter <span class="varspell" title="multiplied">multiply'd</span>, they thought not a punishing so proper and <span class="varspell" title="prportionate">proportionat</span> for God to inflict, as to punish <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> with <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>.  Thus were the common sort of Gentiles wont to think, without any wry thoughts cast upon divine governance.   And therefore <span class="mi">Cicero</span> not in his <span class="mi">Tusculan</span> or <span class="mi">Campanian</span> retirements among the learned wits of that age; but <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="enate">Senat</span> to a <span class="varspell" title="mixed">mixt</span> auditory (though he were sparing otherwise to broach his Philosophy among Statists and Lawyers) yet as to this point both in his oration against <span class="mi">Piso</span>, and in that which is about the answers of the Soothsayers against <span class="mi">Clodius</span>, he declares it <span class="varspell" title="publicly">publikly</span> as no paradox to common ears, that God cannot punish man more, nor make him more <a href="" id="miserable" class="annotBtn">miserable</a>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> still by <a href="" id="sinnfull" class="annotBtn">making him more <span class="varspell" title="sinful">sinnfull</span></a>.  Thus we see how in this <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span> the justice of God stood upright <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> among heathen disputers.  But if any one be truly, and not pretendedly zealous for <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span>, here I call him forth before men and Angels, to use his best and most advised skill, lest God more unavoidably <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ever yet, and in the guiltiest manner be made the author of sin: if he shall not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> deliver over and incite his enemies by <span class="varspell" title="rebukes">rebuks</span> to sin as a punishment, but shall by patent under his own broad seal allow his friends whom he would sanctify and save, whom he would unite to <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, and not dis-<span class="varspell" title="join">joyne</span>, whom he would correct by <span class="varspell" title="wholesome">wholsome</span> <span class="varspell" title="chastening">chastning</span>, and not punish as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> doth the damned by lewd sinning, if he shall allow these in his Law the perfect rule of his own purest <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span>, and our most <span class="varspell" title="edified">edify'd</span> conscience, the perpetrating of an odious and manifold sin without the <span class="varspell" title="least">lest</span> contesting.  Tis <span class="varspell" title="wondered">wonder'd</span> how there can be in God a secret, and a <span class="varspell" title="revealed">reveal'd</span> will; and yet what wonder, if there be in man two answerable causes.  But here there must be two revealed wills grappling in a <span class="varspell" title="fraternal">fraternall</span> <span class="varspell" title="war">warre</span> with one another without any reasonable cause apprehended.  This cannot be <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to ingraft sin into the substance of the law, which law is to provoke sin by crossing and forbidding, not by complying with it.  Nay this is, which I tremble in uttering, to <span class="varspell" title="incarnate">incarnat</span> sin into the unpunishing, and well-<span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> will of God.  To avoid these <span class="varspell" title="dreadful">dreadfull</span> consequences that tread upon the heels of those allowances to sin, will be a task of <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> more difficulty <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to appease those minds which perhaps out of a vigilant and wary conscience except against predestination.  Thus finally we may conclude, that a Law wholly giving licence cannot upon any good consideration be <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> to a holy people, for <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of heart in the vulgar sense.

<a href="" id="Others" class="annotBtn">Others</a> think to evade the matter by not granting any Law of divorce, but <a href="" id="onely" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> a dispensation</a>, which is contrary to the words of Christ, who <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> calls it a <span class="mi">Law</span>, <a href="" id="mark10" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Mark</span>. 10.5</a>.  or if we speak of a command in the strictest definition, then <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> is no more a command <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> divorce, but <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> a free permission to <a href="" id="cannot" class="annotBtn">him who cannot contain</a>.  But as to dispensation I affirm, the same as before of the Law, that it can never be <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> to the allowance of sin, God cannot give it neither in respect of <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, nor in respect of man: not in respect of <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, being a most pure essence, the just avenger of sin; neither can he make that cease to be a <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>, which is in it self <span class="varspell" title="unjust">injust</span> and impure, as all divorces they say were which were not for adultery.  Not in respect of man; for then it must be either to his good or to his <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>; Not to his good; for how can that be <span class="varspell" title="imagined">imagin'd</span> any good to a sinner whom nothing but rebuke and due correction can save, to <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> the determinate oracle of divine Law louder than any reproof dispensing and providing for the impunity, and convenience of sin; to make that <span class="varspell" title="doubtful">doubtfull</span>, or rather <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>, which the end of the law was to make most evidently <span class="varspell" title="hateful">hatefull</span>?  Nor to the <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> of man can a <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> be given; for if <span class="mi">the Law were <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordaind</span> unto life</span>,<a href="" id="ro7" class="annotBtn"> <abbr title="Romans">Ro.</abbr> 7.10</a>.  how can the same God publish <span class="varspell" title="dispenses">dispences</span> against that Law, which must needs be unto death?  Absurd and monstrous would that <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> be, if any Judge or Law should give it a man to cut his own throat, or to <span class="varspell" title="damn">damne</span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>.  <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> therefore presupposes full pardon, or <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> it is not a <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span>, but a most baneful <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> bloody snare.  And why should God enter <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> with a people to be holy, as <span class="mi">the Command is holy, and just, and good, <abbr title="Romans">Ro.</abbr></span>  7.12.  and yet suffer an impure <a href="" id="anc" class="annotBtn">and</a> treacherous <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> to mislead and betray them under the vizard of Law to a legitimate practice of <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleannesse</span>?

</div>
<div class="prose">
<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Therefore"><span class="minitial">T</span>herfore</span> to get some better satisfaction, we must proceed to <span class="varspell" title="inquire">enquire</span> as diligently as we can, what a dispensation is, which I find to be either properly so <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span>, or improperly.  Improperly so <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span>, is rather a particular and exceptive law absolving and disobliging from a more general command for some just and reasonable cause.  As <a href="" id="Numb" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr></span>  9</a>.  they who were unclean, or in a journey, had leave to keep the passover, in the second <span class="varspell" title="month">moneth</span>, but otherwise ever in the first.  As for <a href="" id="Leviticus" class="annotBtn">that in <span class="mi">Leviticus</span></a> of <span class="varspell" title="marrying">marying</span> the <span class="varspell" title="brother's">brothers</span> wife, it was a <span class="varspell" title="penal">penall</span> statute rather than a dispense; and commands nothing injurious or in it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> unclean, <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="prefers">preferres</span> a <span class="varspell" title="special">speciall</span> reason of <span class="varspell" title="charity">charitie</span>, before an institutive <span class="varspell" title="decency">decencie</span>, and perhaps is meant for life time <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>, as is <span class="varspell" title="expressed">exprest</span> beneath in the prohibition of taking two sisters.  What other edict of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, carrying but the semblance of a Law in any other kind, may <span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span> the name of a <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span>, I have not readily to instance.  But a dispensation most properly, is some particular accident rarely <span class="varspell" title="happening">happ'ning</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> not <span class="varspell" title="specified">specify'd</span> in the Law, but left to the decision of charity, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> under the bondage of Jewish rites, much more under the liberty of the Gospel.  Thus did <span class="mi">David enter into the house of God, and did eat the <span class="varspell" title="Show">Shew</span> bread, he and his followers, which was</span> ceremonially <a href="" id="unlawfull" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span></span></a>.  Of <a href="" id="such" class="annotBtn">such</a> dispenses as these it was that <span class="mi">Verdune</span> the <span class="mi">French</span> Divine so gravely disputed in the <span class="varspell" title="Council">Councell</span> of <span class="mi">Trent</span> against Friar <span class="mi">Adrian</span>, who held that the Pope might <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> with any thing.  <span class="mi">It is a fond <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span></span>, saith <span class="mi"><a href="" id="Trent" class="annotBtn">Verdune</a>, that <span class="varspell" title="dispensing">dispencing</span> is a <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span>, nay it is as good distributive justice, as what is most, and the Priest sins if he give it not:  for it is nothing else but a right interpretation of law</span>.  Thus <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> that I can learn touching this matter <span class="varspell" title="wholesomely">wholsomly</span> decreed.  But that God who is the giver of every good and perfect gift, <a href="" id="James" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">James</span> I</a>.  should give out a rule and directory to sin by, should enact a dispensation as long <span class="varspell" title="lived">liv'd</span> as a law <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> to live in <span class="varspell" title="privileged">priviledg'd</span> adultery for <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnes</span> of heart, and yet this <span class="varspell" title="obdurate">obdurat</span> disease cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="conceived">conceiv'd</span> how it was the more amended by this unclean remedy, is the most deadly and <a href="" id="Scorpion" class="annotBtn">Scorpion like gift</a> that the enemy of mankind could have given to any miserable sinner, and is rather such a <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> as that was which the serpent gave to our first parents.  God gave <a href="" id="Quails" class="annotBtn">Quails</a> in his wrath, and Kings in his wrath, yet neither of these things <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> in themselves, but that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> whose eyes cannot behold impurity, should in the book of his holy <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span>, his most <span class="varspell" title="unpassionate">unpassionat</span> law, give licence, and statute for <span class="varspell" title="uncontrolled">uncontroul'd</span> adultery, although it <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> for the <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> opinion, I shall ever <span class="varspell" title="dissuade">disswade</span> my soul from such a creed, such an indulgence as the <a href="" id="shop" class="annotBtn">shop of Antichrist</a> never <span class="varspell" title="forged">forg'd</span> a baser.

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="But"><span class="minitial">B</span>ut</span> if we must needs <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span>, let us for a while so <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> with truth, as to grant that <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> may be <span class="varspell" title="dispensed">dispenc't</span>: yet there will be copious reason found to prove that the Jew had no more right to such a <span class="varspell" title="supposed">suppos'd</span> indulgence, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Christian, whether we look at the clear knowledge <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> he <span class="varspell" title="lived">liv'd</span>, or the strict performance of works <span class="varspell" title="whereto">wherto</span> he was bound.  Besides visions and <span class="varspell" title="prophecies">prophesies</span> they had the Law of God, which <a href="" id="Proverbs" class="annotBtn">in the <span class="varspell" title="Psalms">Psalmes</span> and Proverbs</a> is chiefly <span class="varspell" title="praised">prais'd</span> for <span class="varspell" title="sureness">surenesse</span> and certainty both <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> and perfect to the <span class="varspell" title="enlightening">enlightning</span> of the simple.  How could it be so obscure then, or they so sottishly blind in this plain <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> and <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> duty? They had the same precepts about <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, Christ added nothing to their <span class="varspell" title="clearness">clearnesse</span>, for that had <span class="varspell" title="argued">argu'd</span> them imperfect; <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> opens not the Law, but removes the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisaic">Pharisaick</span> mists <span class="varspell" title="raised">rais'd</span> between the law and the <span class="varspell" title="people's">peoples</span> eyes: the <a href="" id="sentence" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> sentence</a> which he <span class="varspell" title="adds">addes</span>, <span class="mi">What God hath <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> let no man put asunder</span>, is as obscure as any clause <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetcht</span> out of <span class="mi">Genesis</span>, and hath <span class="varspell" title="increased">encreast</span> a yet undecided <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span> of <a href="" id="Clandestine" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Clandestine</span> <span class="varspell" title="marriages">mariages</span></a>.  If we examine over all his sayings, we shall find him not so much interpreting the Law with his words, as referring his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> words to be interpreted by the Law, and <span class="varspell" title="oftener">oftner</span> obscures his mind in short, and vehement, and compact sentences, to blind and puzzle them the more who would not understand the Law.  The <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span> <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> were as little to be <span class="varspell" title="dispensed">dispenc't</span> with for lack of <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> knowledge, as we.
</p>


<p>
Next, none I think will deny, but that they were as much bound to perform the Law as any Christian.  That severe and rigorous knife not sparing the tender fore-skin of any male infant, to carve upon his flesh the mark of that strict and pure <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> <span class="varspell" title="whereinto">wherinto</span> he <span class="varspell" title="entered">enter'd</span>, might give us to understand <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> against the <span class="varspell" title="fancy">fancie</span> of <span class="varspell" title="dispensing">dispencing</span>.  <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>  <span class="mi">Paul</span> testifies, that every <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="circumcised">circumcis'd</span> man is a debtor to the whole law</span>, <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr>  5.  or <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> <span class="mi">circumcision is in vain</span>, <a href="" id="rom2" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 2.  25</a>.  <a name="circumcision">How</a> vain then and how preposterous must it needs be to exact a circumcision of the Flesh from an infant unto an outward <span class="varspell" title="sign">signe</span> of purity, and to <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> an uncircumcision in the soul of a grown man to an inward and <span class="varspell" title="real">reall</span> impurity? How vain again was that law to impose tedious expiations for every slight <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> of ignorance and error, and to <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span> without penance or disturbance an odious crime whether of ignorance or <span class="varspell" title="obstinacy">obstinacie</span>? How unjust also inflicting death <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> extirpation for the mark of circumstantial <span class="varspell" title="pureness">purenes</span> omitted, and proclaiming all honest and <span class="varspell" title="liberal">liberall</span> indemnity to the act of a substantial <span class="varspell" title="impureness">impurenesse</span> committed, making void the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> that was made against it. Thus if we consider the tenor of the Law, to be <span class="varspell" title="circumcised">circumcis'd</span> and to perform all, not pardoning so much as the <span class="varspell" title="escapes">scapes</span> of error and ignorance, and compare this with the condition of the Gospel, <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> and be <span class="varspell" title="baptized">baptiz'd</span>; I suppose it cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> long ere we grant that the Jew was bound as strictly to the performance of every duty as was possible, and therefore could not be <span class="varspell" title="dispensed">dispenc't</span> with more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Christian, perhaps not so much.

<span class="varspell" title="If"><span class="minitial">I</span>f</span> then the Law <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> afford no reason why the Jew should be more gently dealt with <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Christian, then surely the Gospel can afford as little why the Christian should be <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> gently dealt with than the Jew.  The <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> indeed exhorts to highest perfection but <span class="varspell" title="bears">beares</span> with weakest infirmity more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Law.

I answer, This does not prove that the law <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> might give allowance to <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Gospel; and if it were no sin, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> know it the work of the Spirit <span class="mi"><a href="" id="concupiscence" class="annotBtn">to <span class="varspell" title="mortify">mortifie</span> our corrupt desires</a> and <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> concupiscence</span>; but not to root up our <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> affections and disaffections moving to and fro <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> in wisest men upon just and necessary reasons which were the true ground of that <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Mosaic">Mosaick</span></span> <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span>, and is the utmost extent of our pleading.  What is more or <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> perfect we dispute not, but what is <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> or no <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>; and in that I still affirm the Law <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> as perfect obedience as the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>: besides that the prime end of the Gospel is not so much to exact our obedience, as to reveal grace and the satisfaction of our disobedience.  What is now exacted from us, it is the accusing Law that does it <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> yet under the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>; but cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> more extreme to us now, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span> of old: for the Law ever was of works, and the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> ever was of grace.

<p>
Either then the Law by <span class="varspell" title="harmless">harmlesse</span> and <span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="dispenses">dispences</span> which the Gospel is now made to deny, must have anticipated and exceeded the grace of the Gospel, or <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> must be found to have <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="politic">politick</span> and superficial graces without real pardon, saying in general <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> this and live, and yet deceiving and damning under hand, with unsound and hollow permissions, which is utterly abhorring from the end of all Law, as hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="showd">shewd</span>.  But if those indulgences were safe and <span class="varspell" title="sinless">sinles</span> out of <span class="varspell" title="tenderness">tendernes</span> and compassion, as indeed they were, and yet shall be abrogated by the Gospel, then the Law, whose end is by rigor to <span class="varspell" title="magnify">magnifie</span> grace, shall it self give grace, and pluck a <span class="varspell" title="fair">faire</span> plume from the Gospel, instead of <span class="varspell" title="hastening">hastning</span> us thither, alluring us from it.  And <span class="varspell" title="whereas">wheras</span> the terror of the Law was as a servant to <span class="varspell" title="amplify">amplifie</span> and <span class="varspell" title="illustrate">illustrat</span> the <span class="varspell" title="mildness">mildnesse</span> of grace; now the <span class="varspell" title="unmildness">unmildnesse</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Evangelic">Evangelick</span> grace shall turn servant to declare the grace and <span class="varspell" title="mildness">mildnesse</span> of the rigorous Law.  The Law was harsh to <span class="varspell" title="extol">extoll</span> the grace of the Gospel, and now the Gospel by a new affected <span class="varspell" title="strictness">strictnes</span> of her own, shall extenuate the grace, which her self offers.  For by exacting a duty which the Law <span class="varspell" title="dispensed">dispenc't</span>, if we perform it, then is grace <span class="varspell" title="diminished">diminisht</span>, by how much performance advances, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> the <a href="" id="argue" class="annotBtn">Apostle argue wrong</a>: if we perform it not, and perish for not performing, then are the conditions of grace harder <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> those of rigor.  If through Faith and Repentance we perish not, yet grace still remains the <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span>, by requiring that which rigor did not require, or at least not so strictly.  Thus much <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paraeus">Par&aelig;us</span></span>, that if the Gospel require perfecter obedience <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Law as a duty, it exalts the Law and debases it self, which is <span class="varspell" title="dishonorable">dishonourable</span> to the work of our Redemption.  Seeing <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> that all the causes of any allowance that the Jews might have, remain as well to the Christians, this is a certain rule, that so long as the causes remain the allowance ought.  And having thus at length <span class="varspell" title="inquired">enquir'd</span> the truth concerning Law and <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span>, their ends, their uses, their limits, and in what manner both Jew and Christian stands liable to the one, or capable of the other, we may safely conclude, that to affirm the giving of any law, or law-like <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> to sin for <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of heart, is a doctrine of that extravagance from the sage principles of piety, that who so considers <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span>, cannot but admire how this hath been digested all this while.

<a href="" id="WHAT" class="annotBtn">What</a> may we <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> then to salve this seeming <span class="varspell" title="inconsistency">inconsistence</span>?

</p>

<p>
<span class="mi">Moses</span> <a href="" id="deut24" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr>  24.1</a>.  <span class="varspell" title="established">establisht</span> a grave and prudent Law, full of moral equity, full of due consideration towards nature, that cannot be resisted; a Law consenting with the Laws of wisest men and civilest Nations.  That when a man hath <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> a wife, if it come to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> he cannot love her by reason of some displeasing natural quality or <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> in her, let him write her a bill of divorce.  The intent of which Law undoubtedly was this, that if any good and peaceable man should discover some <span class="varspell" title="helpless">helples</span> disagreement or dislike either of mind or body, <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> he could not cheerfully perform the duty of a husband without the perpetual dissembling of
offence and disturbance to his spirit, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to live uncomfortably and unhappily both to himself and to his wife, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to continue undertaking a duty which he could not possibly discharge, he might <span class="varspell" title="dismiss">dismisse</span> her whom he could not tolerably and so not conscionably retain.  And this law the Spirit of God by the mouth of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Solomon">Salomon</span></span>, <abbr title="Proverbs">Pro.</abbr>  30.<a href="" id="21,23" class="annotBtn">21,23</a>.  testifies to be a good and a necessary Law; by granting it that <span class="mi">a hated
woman</span> (for so the <span class="varspell" title="Hebrew">hebrew</span> word signifies, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
odious though it come all to one) <span class="mi">that a hated woman
when she is <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span>, is a thing that the earth cannot <span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span></span>.
What follows then but that the charitable Law must
remedy what nature cannot <span class="varspell" title="undergo">undergoe</span>.  Now that many
licentious and hard hearted men took hold of this Law
to cloak their bad purposes, is nothing strange to
<span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span>.  And these were they, not for whom <span class="mi">Moses</span> made
the Law, God forbid, but whose <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnes</span> of heart taking
ill advantage by this Law he held it better to suffer as by
accident, where it could not be detected, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
good men should <span class="varspell" title="lose">loose</span> their just and <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span>
of remedy: Christ <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> having to answer these
tempting <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>, according as his custom was, not meaning to inform their proud ignorance what <span class="mi">Moses</span>
did in the true intent of the Law, which they had ill
cited, suppressing the true cause for which <span class="mi">Moses</span> gave it,
and extending it to every slight matter, tells them their
own, what <span class="mi">Moses</span> was <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> to suffer by their abuse of
his Law.  Which is yet more plain if we mark that our
<span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> in the<a href="" id="fifth" class="annotBtn"> fifth of <span class="mi"><abbr title="Matthew">Matth.</abbr></span></a>  cites not the Law of <span class="mi">Moses</span>
but the Pharisaical tradition <a href="" id="falsly" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="falsely">falsly</span></a> grounded upon
that law.  And in those other places, <a href="" id="Chap" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Chapter">Chap.</abbr>  19.  and <span class="mi">Mark</span>.
10</a>.  the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> cite the Law, but <span class="varspell" title="conceal">conceale</span> the wise and
human reason there <span class="varspell" title="expressed">exprest</span>; which our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> corrects
not in them, whose pride <span class="varspell" title="deserved">deserv'd</span> not his instruction,
only returns them what is proper to them; <span class="mi">Moses for the
<span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of your heart <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> you</span>, that is, such as you <span class="mi">to
put away your wives</span>; and <span class="mi">to you he wrote this precept</span> for
that cause, which (<span class="mi">to you</span>) must be read with an
<a href="" id="impression" class="annotBtn">impression</a>, and understood limitedly of such as <span class="varspell" title="covered">cover'd</span>
ill purposes under that Law: for it was seasonable that
they should hear their own unbounded licence <span class="varspell" title="rebuked">rebukt</span>,
but not seasonable for them to hear a good <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span>
<span class="varspell" title="requisite">requisit</span> liberty <span class="varspell" title="explained">explain'd</span>.  But us he hath taught better,
if we have <span class="varspell" title="ears">eares</span> to hear.  He <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> <span class="varspell" title="acknowledged">acknowledg'd</span> it to
be a Law, <span class="mi">Mark</span> 10.  and being a law of God, it must have
an undoubted <span class="mi">end of charity, which may be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> with a
pure heart, a good conscience, and faith <span class="varspell" title="unfeigned">unfained</span></span>, as was
heard: it cannot allow sin, but is purposely to resist sin,
 as by the same chapter to <a href="" id="timmy" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Timothy</span></a> appeares.  There we learn also <span class="mi">that the Law is good, if a man use it lawfully</span>.  Out of doubt then there must be a certain good in this Law which <span class="mi">Moses</span> willingly <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span>; and there might be an <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span> use made <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> by hypocrits; and that was it which <span class="mi">Moses</span> unwillingly <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span>; foreseeing it in general, but not able to discern it in particulars.  Christ <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> mentions not here what <span class="mi">Moses</span> and the Law intended: for good men might know that by many other rules: and the <span class="varspell" title="scornful">scornfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> were not fit to be told, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> they could <span class="varspell" title="employ">imploy</span> that knowledge they had, <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> abusively.  Only he acquaints them with what <span class="mi">Moses</span> by them was put to suffer.

<p >
<span class="msummary">The words of the Institution how to be understood; and of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> answer to his Disciples</span>.
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="And"><span class="minitial">A</span>nd</span> to entertain a little their overweening arrogance as best befitted, and to amaze them yet <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span>, because they thought it no hard matter to fulfill the Law, he draws them up to that unseparable institution which God <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span> in the beginning before the fall, when man and woman were both perfect, and could have no cause to separate: just as in <a href="" id="samechap" class="annotBtn">the same <abbr title="Chapter">Chap.</abbr></a>  he stands not to contend with the arrogant young man who boasted his observance of the whole Law, whether he had indeed kept it or not, but <span class="varspell" title="screws">skrues</span> him up higher, to a task of that perfection, which no man is bound to imitate.  And in like manner that pattern of the first institution he set before <a href="" id="opinionative" class="annotBtn">the opinionative <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span></a> to <span class="varspell" title="dazzle">dazle</span> them and not to bind us.  For this is a solid rule, that every command <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> with a reason, binds our obedience no otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that reason holds.  Of this sort was <a href="" id="Eden" class="annotBtn">that command</a> in <span class="mi">Eden; <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> shall a man cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh</span>: which we see is no absolute command, but with an inference, <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span></span>: the reason then must be first <span class="varspell" title="considered">consider'd</span>, that our obedience be not mis-obedience.  The first is, for it is not single, because the wife is to the husband <span class="mi">flesh of his flesh</span>, as in the verse going before.  But this reason cannot be sufficient of it self: for why then should he for his wife leave his father and mother, with whom he is <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> more <span class="mi">flesh of flesh and bone of bone</span>, as being made of their substance. And besides it can be but a sorry and ignoble society of life, whose unseparable injunction depends <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> upon <a href="" id="flesh" class="annotBtn">flesh and bones</a>.  <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> we must look higher, since Christ himself recalls us to the beginning, and we shall <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> that the primitive reason of never divorcing, was that sacred and not vain promise of God to remedy <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> loneliness by <span class="mi">making him a meet help for him</span>, though not now in perfection, as at first, yet still in proportion as things now are.  And this is repeated <abbr title="verse">vers.</abbr>  20 when all other creatures were fitly associated and brought to <span class="mi">Adam</span>, as if the divine power had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> in some care and deep thought, because <span class="mi">there was not yet found an help meet for man</span>.  And can we so slightly <span class="varspell" title="depress">depresse</span> the all-wise purpose of a deliberating God, as if his consultation had <span class="varspell" title="produced">produc't</span> no other good for man but to <span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span> him with an <span class="varspell" title="accidental">accidentall</span> companion of propagation, which his sudden word had already made for every beast?  nay a <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> good to man it will be found, if she must at all <span class="varspell" title="adventures">aventures</span> be <span class="varspell" title="fastened">fasten'd</span> upon him individually.  And therefore even plain sense and equity, and, which is above them both, the all-interpreting voice of Charity her self cries loud that this primitive reason, this consulted promise of God <span class="mi">to make a meet help</span>, is the <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> cause that gives authority to this command of not divorcing, to be a command.  And it might be further added, that if the true definition of a wife were <span class="varspell" title="asked">askt</span> in good earnest, this clause of being <span class="mi">a meet help</span> would <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> it self so necessary, and so essential in that demonstrative argument, that it might be logically concluded: <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> she who naturally and perpetually is no meet help, can be no wife; which <span class="varspell" title="clearly">cleerly</span> takes away the difficulty of dismissing of such a one.  If this be not thought <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, I answer yet <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span>, that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> it mean a fit and tolerable <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, is not inseparable neither by <a name="unnatural">nature</a> nor institution.  Not by nature for then those <span class="varspell" title="Mosaic">Mosaick</span> divorces had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> against nature, if separable and inseparable be contraries, as who doubts they be: and what is against nature is against Law, if soundest Philosophy abuse us not: by this <span class="varspell" title="reckoning">reckning</span> <span class="mi">Moses</span> should <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> most <span class="varspell" title="unmosaic">unmosaick</span> that is, most illegal, not to say most <span class="varspell" title="unnatural">unnaturall</span>.  Nor is it inseparable by the first institution: for then no second institution in the same Law for so many causes could dissolve it: it being most unworthy a human (as <span class="mi">Plato's</span> judgement is in the <a href="" id="book" class="annotBtn">fourth book of his <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span></a>) much more a divine Law-giver to write two several decrees upon the same thing.  But what could <span class="mi">Plato</span> have <span class="varspell" title="deemed">deem'd</span> if the one of these were good,  the other <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> to be done?  Lastly, suppose it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> inseparable by institution, yet in competition with higher things, as religion and charity in mainest matters, and when the <span class="varspell" title="chief">chiefe</span> end is <span class="varspell" title="frustrated">frustrat</span> for which it was <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span>, as hath been shown, if still it must remain inseparable, it holds a strange and <span class="varspell" title="lawless">lawlesse</span> propriety from all other works of God under heaven.  From these many considerations we may safely gather, that so much of the first institution as our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> mentions, for he mentions not all, was but to quell and put to non-plus the tempting <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>; and to lay open their ignorance and shallow understanding of the Scriptures.  For, saith he, <span class="mi"><a href="" id="cleave" class="annotBtn">have ye not read</a> that he which made them at the beginning, made them male and female, and said, for this cause shall a man cleave to his wife?</span> which these blind usurpers of <span class="mi">Moses</span> chair could not gainsay: as if this single respect of male and female were sufficient against a thousand inconveniences and <span class="varspell" title="mischiefs">mischiefes</span>, to <span class="varspell" title="clog">clogge</span> a <span class="varspell" title="rational">rationall</span> creature to his <span class="varspell" title="endless">endlesse</span> sorrow unrelinquishably, under the <span class="varspell" title="guileful">guilefull</span> superscription of his intended solace and comfort.  What if they had thus <span class="varspell" title="answered">answer'd</span>, Master, if thou mean to make wedlock as inseparable as it was from the <span class="varspell" title="beginning">begining</span>, let it be made also a fit society, as God meant it, which we shall soon understand it ought to be, if thou recite the whole reason of the law.  <span class="varspell" title="Doubtless">Doubtlesse</span> our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> had applauded their just answer.  For then they had expounded this command of Paradise, even as <span class="mi">Moses</span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> expounds it by his <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span> of divorce, that is, with due and wise regard had to the premises and reasons of the first command, according to which, without unclean and temporizing permissions he instructs us in this imperfect state what we may lawfully <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> about divorce.
</p>


<p>
But if it be thought that the Disciples offended at the <span class="varspell" title="rigor">rigour</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> answer, could yet obtain no mitigation of the former sentence <span class="varspell" title="pronounced">pronounc't</span> to the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>, it may be fully <span class="varspell" title="answered">answer'd</span>, that our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> continues the same reply to his Disciples, as men <span class="varspell" title="leavened">leaven'd</span> with the same customary licence, which the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintain'd</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="displeased">displeas'd</span> at the removing of a <span class="varspell" title="traditional">traditionall</span> abuse <span class="varspell" title="whereto">wherto</span> they had so long not unwillingly <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>: it was no time then to contend with their slow and prejudicial belief, in a thing <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> an ordinary measure of light in Scripture, with some attention might afterwards <span class="varspell" title="inform">informe</span> them well <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>.  And yet ere Christ had <span class="varspell" title="finished">finisht</span> this argument, they might have <span class="varspell" title="picked">pickt</span> out of his own concluding words, an answer more to their minds, and in effect the same with that which hath been all this while entreating audience.  <span class="mi">All men</span>, said he, <span class="mi"><a href="" id="receive" class="annotBtn">cannot receive this saying</a>, save they to whom it is given, he that is able to receive it let him receive it</span>.  What saying is this which is left to a <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> choice to receive or not receive?   What but the married life.  was our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> then so mild and  <span class="varspell" title="favorable">favourable</span> to the <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknesse</span> of a single man, and is he <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> on the sudden so rigorous and inexorable to the distresses and extremities of an ill wedded man?  Did <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> so graciously give leave to change the better single life for the worse <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> life?  Did he open so to us this hazardous and <span class="varspell" title="accidental">accidentall</span> <span class="varspell" title="door">doore</span> of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> to shut upon us like the gate of death without retracting or returning, without permitting to change the worst, most insupportable, most unchristian mischance of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> for all the <span class="varspell" title="mischiefs">mischiefes</span> and <span class="varspell" title="sorrows">sorrowes</span> that can ensue, being an ordinance which was especially <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> as a cordial and exhilarating cup of solace the better to <span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span> our other crosses and afflictions?  <span class="varspell" title="questionless">questionlesse</span> this were a <span class="varspell" title="hardheartedness">hardheartednesse</span> of undivorcing, worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that in the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span> which they say extorted the allowance from <span class="mi">Moses</span>, and is utterly dissonant from all the doctrine of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>.  After these considerations <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to take a law out of Paradise <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> in time of <span class="varspell" title="original">originall</span> perfection, and to take it barely without those just and <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> inferences and reasons which mainly establish it, nor so much as admitting those <span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span> and safe allowances <span class="varspell" title="wherewith">wherwith</span> <span class="mi">Moses</span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> interprets it to the <span class="varspell" title="fallen">faln</span> condition of man, argues nothing in us but <span class="varspell" title="rashness">rashnesse</span> and contempt of those <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> that God left us in his pure and <span class="varspell" title="chaste">chast</span> Law without which it will not be possible for us to perform the strict imposition of this command: or if we strive beyond our strength, we shall strive to <span class="varspell" title="obey">obay</span> it otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> God commands it.  And lamented experience daily teaches the bitter and vain fruits of this our presumption, forcing men in a thing <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> we are not able to judge either of their strength, or of their sufferance.  Whom neither one vice nor other by natural addiction, but <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> ruins, which <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span> is not the fault of that ordinance, for God gave it as a blessing, nor <span class="varspell" title="always">alwayes</span> of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> mis-choosing; it being an error above wisdom to prevent, as examples of wisest men so mistaken manifest: it is the fault <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> of a perverse opinion that will have it <span class="varspell" title="continued">continu'd</span> in despite of nature and reason, when indeed it was never truly <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span>.  All those <span class="varspell" title="expositors">expositers</span> upon the first of <span class="mi">Matthew</span> <span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span> the Law of <span class="mi">Moses</span> to be the Law of the Lord <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> no addition or diminution hath place; yet coming to the point of divorce, as if they <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span> not to be <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> <a href="" id="least" class="annotBtn">least</a> in the kingdom of <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span>, any slight evasion will content them to reconcile those contradictions which they make between Christ and <span class="mi">Moses</span>, between Christ and Christ.

Alas for <span class="mi">Moses</span>! what shall we say for him, while we are taught to <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> he <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> not one act <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> both of cruelty and <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleannesse</span> in one divorce, but made it a plain and lasting law against law, whereby ten thousand acts accounted both <span class="varspell" title="cruel">cruell</span> and unclean, might be daily committed, and this without the least suit or petition of the people that <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> can read of.
</p>

<p>
And can we conceive without vile thoughts, that the majesty and <span class="varspell" title="holiness">holines</span> of God could endure so many ages to <span class="varspell" title="gratify">gratifie</span> a stubborn people in the practice of a foul polluting sin, and could he expect they should abstain, he not signifying his mind in a plain command, at such time especially when he was framing their laws and them to all possible perfection? But they were to look back to the first institution, nay rather why was not that individual institution brought out of Paradise, as was <a href="" id="that" class="annotBtn">that of the Sabbath</a>, and repeated in the body of the Law, that men might have understood it to be a command? for that any sentence that bears the resemblance of a precept, set there so out of place in another world at such a distance from the whole Law, and not once <span class="varspell" title="mentioned">mention'd</span> there, should be an obliging command to us, is very disputable, and perhaps it might be <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> to be a command without further dispute: however, it commands not absolutely, as hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="cleared">clear'd</span>, but only with reference to that precedent promise of God, which is the very ground of his institution; if that <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> not in some tolerable sort, how can we affirm such a matrimony to be the same which God instituted!  In such an accident it will best <span class="varspell" title="behoove">behove</span> our <span class="varspell" title="soberness">sobernes</span> to follow rather what moral <span class="mi">Sinai</span> prescribes equal to our strength, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> fondly to think within our strength of all that lost Paradise relates.

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Another"><span class="minitial">A</span>nother</span> while it shall suffice them, that it was not a moral but a judicial Law, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> so was abrogated.  Nay rather not abrogated, because judicial: which Law the ministery of Christ came not to deal with.  And who put it in <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> power to exempt, where Christ speaks in general of not abrogating <span class="mi">the least jot or tittle</span>, and in special not that of divorce, because it follows among those Laws; which he <span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span> expresly not to abrogate, but to vindicate from abusive traditions: which is most evidently to be seen in the <a href="" id="16" class="annotBtn">16.  of <span class="mi">Luke</span></a>, where this caution of not abrogating is inserted <span class="varspell" title="immediately">immediatly</span>, and not otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> purposely, when no other point of the Law is toucht, but that of divorce.  And if we mark the <a href="" id="31" class="annotBtn">31.  vers of <span class="mi">Mat. </span> the 5</a>. he there cites not the Law of<span class="mi"> Moses</span>, but the licencious Glosse which <span class="varspell" title="traduced">traduc't</span> the Law; that <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> which he cited, that he abrogated, and not only abrogated, but <span class="varspell" title="disallowed">disallow'd</span> and flatly <span class="varspell" title="condemned">condemn'd</span>, which could not be the Law of <span class="mi">Moses</span>; for that had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> foulely to the rebuke of his great servant.  To abrogate a Law made with <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> allowance, had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> to tell us only that such a Law was now to cease: but to refute it with an ignominious note of civilizing adultery, casts the reproof, which was meant only to the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> upon him who made the Law.  But yet if that be judicial which belongs to a civil Court, this Law is <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> judicial <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> nine of the ten Commandements; for antiquaries affirm that divorces proceeded among the Jews without knowledge of the Magistrate, only with <a href="" id="hands" class="annotBtn">hands and seales</a> under the testimony of some <span class="varspell" title="Rabbis">Rabbies</span> to be then present.  <a href="" id="Perkins" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Perkins</span> in a <span class="mi">Treatise of Conscience</span></a> grants, that what in the judicial Law is of common equity, binds also the Christian.  And how to judge of this, prescribes 2. <span class="varspell" title="ways">wayes</span>.  If wise Nations have enacted the like decree.  Or if it maintain the good of family, Church, or Common-wealth.  This <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> is a pure moral <span class="mi">economical</span> Law, too hastily imputed of tolerating sin; being rather so clear in nature and reason, that it was left to a <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> own arbitrement to be <span class="varspell" title="determined">determin'd</span> between God and his own conscience; not only among the Jews, but in every wise nation; the restraint <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span>, who is not too thick sighted, may see how <span class="varspell" title="hurtful">hurtfull</span> and distractive it is to the house, the Church, and Common-wealth.  And that power which Christ never took from the master of
family, but <span class="varspell" title="rectified">rectify'd</span> only to a right and wary use at
home; that power the undiscerning Canonist hath
improperly usurpt into his <a href="" id="leet" class="annotBtn">Court-leet</a>, and <span class="varspell" title="bescribbled">bescribbl'd</span>
with a thousand trifling impertinencies, which yet have
<span class="varspell" title="filled">fill'd</span> the life of man with serious trouble and calamity.
Yet grant it were of old a judicial Law, it need not be
the <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> moral for that, being conversant, as it is, about
<span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> or vice.  And our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> disputes not <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> the

of divorce, whether it be adultery or no; if <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> he

<span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span>; which is absurd to imagine that the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> of

</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Others"><span class="minitial">O</span>thers</span> are so ridiculous as to allege that this licence of divorcing was <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> them because they were so <span class="varspell" title="accustomed">accustom'd</span> in Egypt.  As if an ill custom were to be kept to all posterity; for the dispensation is both universal and of time unlimited, and so indeed no dispensation at all; for the over-dated dispensation of a thing <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span>, serves for nothing but to encrease <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnes</span> of heart, and makes men but wax more incorrigible, which were a great reproach to be said of any Law or allowance that God should give us.  In these opinions it would be more Religion to advise well, lest we make our selves juster <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> God, by censuring rashly that for sin which his unspotted Law without rebuke allows, and his people without being conscious of displeasing him have <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>.  And if we can think so of Moses, as that the Jewish obstinacy could compell him to write such impure permissions against the rule of God and his own judgement, doubtles it was his part to have protested <span class="varspell" title="publicly">publickly</span> what straits he was <span class="varspell" title="driven">driv'n</span> to, and to have <span class="varspell" title="declared">declar'd</span> his conscience when he gave any Law against his mind; for the Law is the touch-stone of sin and of conscience, and must not be intermixt with corrupt indulgences; for then it looses the greatest praise it has, of being certain, and infallible, not leading into error, as all the Jews were led by this connivance of Moses if it were a connivence.  But still they fly back to the primitive institution, and would have us re-enter Paradise against <a href="" id="sword" class="annotBtn">the sword that guards it</a>.  Whom I again thus reply to, that the place in Genesis contains the description of a fit and perfect <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, with an interdict of ever divorcing such a union; but where nature is <span class="varspell" title="discovered">discover'd</span> to have never <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> indeed, but vehemently seeks to part, it cannot be there <span class="varspell" title="conceived">conceiv'd</span> that God forbids it; nay he commands it both in the Law and in the Prophet <span class="mi">Malachy</span>, which is to be our rule.  And <a href="" id="upon" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Perkins</span> upon this chap.  of <span class="mi">Matth</span></a>. deals plainly, that our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> confutes not <span class="mi">Moses</span> Law, but the false glosses that <span class="varspell" title="depraved">deprav'd</span> the Law; which being true, <span class="mi">Perkins</span> must needs grant, that somthing then is left to that law which Christ found no fault with; and what can that be but the conscionable use of such liberty as the plain words import?  So that by his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> inference, Christ did not absolutely intend to restrain all divorces to the <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> cause of adultery.  This therefore is the true scope of our Saviours will, that he who looks upon the law concerning divorce, should look also back upon the first institution, that he may <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> what is perfectest: and he that looks upon the institution should not refuse as <span class="varspell" title="sinful">sinfull</span> and <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span> those allowances which God affords him in his following Law, lest he make <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> purer <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> his maker; and presuming above strength, slip into temptations irrecoverably.  For this is <span class="varspell" title="wonderful">wonderfull</span>, that in all those decrees concerning <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, God should never once mention the prime institution to <span class="varspell" title="dissuade">disswade</span> them from divorcing; and that he should forbid smaller sinnes as opposite to the <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of their hearts, and let this adulterous matter of divorce pass ever <span class="varspell" title="unreproved">unreprov'd</span>.
</p>

<p>
This is also to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="marvelled">marvell'd</span>, that seeing Christ did not condemn whatever it was that <span class="mi">Moses</span> <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span>, and that therupon the Christian Magistrate permits usury and open stews, and here with us adultery to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> so slightly <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span>, which was <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span> by death to these hard hearted <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span>, why <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> should strain thus at the matter of divorce, which may stand so much with charity to permit, and make no scruple to <a href="" id="usury" class="annotBtn">allow usury</a> <span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteem'd</span> to be so much against charity.  But this it is to embroile our selves against the righteous and all-wise <span class="varspell" title="Judgments">Judgements</span> and Statutes of God; which are not variable and contrarious, as we would make them, one while permitting and another while forbidding, but are most constant and most harmonious each to other.  For how can the uncorrupt and majestick Law of God, bearing in her hand the wages of life and death, <span class="varspell" title="harbor">harbour</span> such a repugnance within <span class="varspell" title="herself">herselfe</span>, as to require an unexempted and impartiall obedience to all her decrees, either from us or from our Mediator, and yet debase her <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> to faulter so many ages with <a href="" id="circ" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="circumcised">circumcis'd</span> adulteries</a> by unclean and slubbering permissions.

</p>


<p class="first">
<a href="" id="YET" class="annotBtn">Yet</a> <a href="" id="opinion" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Beza's</span> opinion</a> is that a <span class="varspell" title="politic">politick</span> Law, but what  <span class="varspell" title="politic">politick</span> Law I know not, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> one of <a href="" id="Matchiavel" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Matchiavel's</span></a>, may regulate sin; may <span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span> indeed, I grant, with imperfection for a time, as the Apostles did in ceremoniall things: but as for <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>, the essence of it cannot consist with rule; and if the law fall to regulate <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>, and not to take it utterly away, it necessarily confirms and establishes <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>.  To make a regularity of <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> by law, either the law must straiten <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> into no <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span>, or <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> must crook the law into no law.  The <span class="varspell" title="Judicial">Judiciall</span> law can serve to no other end <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the protector and champion of Religion and honest civility, as is set down plainly, <a href="" id="rom13" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Rom</span>. 13</a>.  and is but the arm of <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> law, which can no more be separate from justice <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> justice from <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>: their office also in a different manner steers the same cours; the one teaches what is good by precept, the other unteaches what is bad by punishment.  But if we give way to <span class="varspell" title="politic">politick</span> dispensations of lewd <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleannesse</span>, the first good consequence of such a relaxe will <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the justifying of <a href="" id="stews" class="annotBtn">Papal stews</a>, <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> with a toleration of epidemick whordom.  Justice must revolt from the end of her authority, and become the patron of that <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> she was created the punisher.  The example of usury which is commonly <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span>, makes against the allegation which it brings, as I <span class="varspell" title="touched">touch'd</span> before.  Besides that usury, so much as is permitted by the Magistrate and demanded with common equity, is neither against the word of God, nor the rule of charity, as hath been often <span class="varspell" title="discussed">discus't</span> by men of eminent learning and iudgement.  There must be therefore some other example found out to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us wherein <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> policy may with warrant from God settle <span class="varspell" title="wickedness">wickednes</span> by law, and make that <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> which is <span class="varspell" title="lawless">lawlesse</span>.  Although I doubt not but upon deeper consideration, that which is true in Physick, <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> be found as true in politie: that as of bad pulses those that beat most in order, are much worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> those that keep the most inordinat circuit, so of popular vices those that may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> committed legally, <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> be more pernicious <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> those which are left to their own cours at perill, not under a stinted <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span> to sin orderly and regularly, which is an implicit contradiction, but under due and <span class="varspell" title="fearless">fearlesse</span> execution of punishment.
</p>

<p>
The political law, since it cannot regulate vice, is to restrain it, by using all means to root it out: but if it suffer the weed to grow up to any pleasurable or contented height upon what pretext soever, it fastens the root, it prunes and dresses vice, as if it were a good plant.  Let no man doubt <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to affirm that it is not so <span class="varspell" title="hurtful">hurtfull</span> or <span class="varspell" title="dishonorable">dishonourable</span> to a Common wealth, nor so much to the hardning of hearts, when those worse faults pretended to be <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, are committed by who so dares under strict and executed penalty as when those <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> faults tolerated for fear of greater, harden their faces, not their hearts only, under the protection of <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> authority.  For what <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> indignity were this, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> as if Justice her self, the Queen of <span class="varspell" title="virtues">vertues</span>, descending from her <span class="varspell" title="sceptered">scepter'd</span> royalty, instead of conquering should compound and treat with sin her eternal adversary and rebel, upon ignoble terms.  Or as if the judicial Law were like that <a href="" id="steward" class="annotBtn">untrusty steward</a> in the Gospel and instead of calling in the debts of his moral master, should give out subtle and sly acquittances to keep him self from begging.  Or let us person him like some wretched itinerary Judge, who to gratifie his delinquents before him, would let them basely break his head, lest they should pull him from the bench, and throw him over the barre.  <span class="varspell" title="Unless">Unlesse</span> we had rather think both moral and judicial full of malice and deadly purpose <span class="varspell" title="conspired">conspir'd</span> to let the dettor Israelite the seed of <span class="mi">Abraham</span> run on upon a banckrout score, <span class="varspell" title="flattered">flatter'd</span> with insufficient and insnaring discharges, that so he might be hal<span class="varspell" title="hailed">hal'd</span> to a more cruel forfeit for all the indulgent arrears which those judicial acquitments had ingaged him in.  No no, this cannot be, that the Law whose integrity and <span class="varspell" title="faithfulness">faithfulnesse</span> is next to God, should be either the <span class="varspell" title="shameless">shamelesse</span> broker of our impurities, or the intended instrument of our destruction.  The method of holy correction such as became the Common wealth of <span class="mi">Israel</span>, is not to bribe sin with sin, to capitulate and hire out one crime with another: but with more noble and <span class="varspell" title="graceful">gracefull</span> severity <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="" id="Popilius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Popilius</span></a> the <span class="mi">Roman legat</span> <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> with <span class="mi">Antiochus</span>, to limit and level out the direct way from vice to vertu, with <span class="varspell" title="straightest">straitest</span> and exactest lines on either side, not winding, or indenting so much as to the right hand of fair pretences.  Violence indeed and insurrection may force the Law to suffer what it cannot mend: but to write a decree in allowance of sin, as soon can the hand of Justice rot off.  Let this be ever concluded as a truth that will outlive the faith of those that seek to bear it down.

<span class="msummary">That divorce was not <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> for <a name="wivesonly">wives</a> only, as <span class="reversem">Beza</span> and <span class="reversem">Paraeus</span>  write.  More of the institution.
</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Lastly"><span class="minitial">L</span>astly</span>, if divorce were granted, as <span class="mi">Beza</span> and others say, not for men but to release afflicted wives; certainly it is not only a dispensation, but a most <span class="varspell" title="merciful">mercifull</span> Law: and why it should not yet be in force, being wholly as <span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span>, I know not what can be in cause but <span class="varspell" title="senseless">senselesse</span> cruelty.  But yet to say, divorce was granted for relief of wives, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> of husbands, is but weakly <span class="varspell" title="conjectured">conjectur'd</span>, and is manifest the extreme shift of a huddled exposition.  Whenas it could not be found how <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of heart should be <span class="varspell" title="lessened">lessn'd</span> by liberty of divorce, a fancy was <span class="varspell" title="devised">devis'd</span> to hide the flaw, by commenting that divorce was permitted only for the help of wives.  Palpably <a href="" id="uxorious" class="annotBtn">uxorious!</a>  Who can be ignorant that woman was created for man, and not man for woman; and that a husband may be <span class="varspell" title="injured">injur'd</span> as insufferably in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> as a wife.  What an injury is it after wedlock not to be <span class="varspell" title="beloved">belov'd</span>, what to be slighted, what to be contended with in point of house-rule who shall be the head, not for any parity of <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span>, for that were somthing reasonable, but out of a female pride.  <span class="mi">I suffer not</span>, saith S.  Paul, <span class="mi">the woman to usurp authority over the man</span>.<a href="" id="suffer" class="annotBtn">*</a>  If the Apostle could not suffer it, into what mould is he <span class="varspell" title="mortified">mortify'd</span> that can?  <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Solomon">Salomon</span></span> saith, <span class="mi">that a bad wife is to her husband as <span class="varspell" title="rottenness">rott'nnesse</span> to his bones, a <a href="" id="continual" class="annotBtn">continual</a> dropping: better dwell in a corner of the house top, or in the wildernes</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> with such a one. <span class="mi"> Who so hideth her hideth the wind, and one of the four mischiefs that the earth cannot bear. </span> If the Spirit of God wrote such aggravations as these, and as may be guest by these similitudes, counsels the man rather to divorce <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to live with such a collegue, and yet on the other side expresses nothing of the wives suffering with a bad husband; is it not most likely that God in his Law had more pitty towards man thus wedlockt, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> towards the woman that was created for another.  The Same Spirit relates to us the cours which the <span class="mi">Medes</span> and <span class="mi">Persians</span> took by occasion of <a href="" id="Vashti" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Vashti</span></a>, whose <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> denial to come at her husbands sending, lost her the being Queen any longer, and set up a wholsom Law, <span class="mi">that every man should <span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span> rule in his own house</span>.  And the divine relater <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> us not the least <span class="varspell" title="sign">signe</span> of disliking what was done; how should he?  if <span class="mi">Moses</span> long before was nothing <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> mindful of the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> and preeminence due to man.  So that to say divorce was granted for woman rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> man, was but fondly invented.  Esteeming <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to have asserted thus an <span class="varspell" title="injured">injur'd</span> law of <span class="mi">Moses</span> from the unwarranted and guilty name of a dispensation, to be again a most <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> and requisite law, we have the word of Christ himself, that he came not to alter the least tittle of it; and signifies no small displeasure against him that shall teach to do so.  On which relying, I shall not much waver to affirm, that <a href="" id="those" class="annotBtn">those words</a> which are made to intimate, as if they forbad all divorce but for adultery (though <span class="mi">Moses</span> have constituted otherwise) those words <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> circumscriptly, without regard to any precedent law of <span class="mi">Moses</span> or attestation of Christ himself, or without care to preserve those his fundamental and superior laws of nature and charity, to which all other ordinances give up their seals, are as much against plain equity, and the mercy of religion, as those words of <span class="mi">Take, eat, this is my body</span>, <a href="" id="understood" class="annotBtn">elementally understood</a>, are against nature and sense.
</p>

<p>
And surely the restoring of this degraded law, hath well <span class="varspell" title="recompensed">recompenc't</span> the diligence was <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, by <span class="varspell" title="enlightening">enlightning</span> us further to find out <span class="varspell" title="wherefore">wherfore</span> Christ took off the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> from alleging the law, and <span class="varspell" title="referred">referr'd</span> them to the first institution, not condemning, altering, or abolishing this precept of divorce, which is plainly moral, for that were against his truth, his promise, and his prophetick office; but knowing how fallaciously they had cited, and <span class="varspell" title="concealed">conceal'd</span> the particular and natural reason of the Law, that they might <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> any froward reason of their own, he lets <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> that sophistry <span class="varspell" title="unconvinced">unconvinc't</span>, for that had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> to teach them else, which his purpose was not.  And since they had <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> a liberty which the law gave not, he amuses and repells their tempting pride with a perfection of Paradise, which the law <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> not; not <span class="varspell" title="thereby">therby</span> to oblige our performance to that <span class="varspell" title="whereto">wherto</span> the law never <span class="varspell" title="enjoined">enjoyn'd</span> the <span class="varspell" title="fallen">fal'n</span> estate of man; for if the first institution must make wedlock, what ever happen, inseparable to us, it must make it also as perfect, as meetly <span class="varspell" title="helpful">helpfull</span>, and as comfortable, as God <span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span> it should be, at least in some degree; otherwise it is not equal or proportionable to the strength of man, that he should be <span class="varspell" title="reduced">reduc't</span> into such indissoluble bonds to his assured misery, if all the other conditions of that <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> be manifestly <span class="varspell" title="altered">alter'd</span>.

<span class="msummary">How to be understood that they must be one flesh: and how that those whom God hath <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> man should not sunder</span>.
</p>


<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Next"><span class="minitial">N</span>ext</span> he saith, <span class="mi">they must be one flesh</span>, which, when all conjecturing is <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, will be found to import no more but to make legitimate and good the carnal act, which <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> might seem to have somthing of pollution in it: And infers thus much over, that the fit union of their souls be such as may even incorporate them to love and amity; but that can never be where no correspondence is of the <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>; nay instead of being one flesh, they will be rather two carkasses <span class="varspell" title="chained">chain'd</span> unnaturally together; or as it may <span class="varspell" title="happen">happ'n</span>, a living <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> bound to a dead corps, a punishment too like that inflicted by the tyrant <a href="" id="Mezentius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Mezentius</span></a>; so little worthy to be <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> as that remedy of <span class="varspell" title="loneliness">lonelinesse</span> which God meant us.  Since we know it is not the <span class="varspell" title="joining">joyning</span> of another body will remove lonelines, but the uniting of another compliable mind, and that it is no blessing but a torment, nay a base and brutish condition to be one flesh, unles wher nature can in some measure fix a unity of disposition.  The meaning therefore of these words, <span class="mi">For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife</span>,<a href="" id="cause" class="annotBtn">*</a> was first to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us the deer affection which naturally <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> most commonly grows in every not unnatural <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to the leaving of parents, or other familiarity whatsoever: next, it justifies a man in so doing, that nothing is done undutifully to father or mother.  But he that should be here sternly commanded to cleave to his error, a disposition which to his he finds will never ciment, a quotidian of sorrow and discontentment in his house, let us be <span class="varspell" title="excused">excus'd</span> to pause a little and bethinke us every way round, ere <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> lay such a flat solecisme upon the gracious, and certainly not inexorable, not <span class="varspell" title="ruthless">ruthlesse</span> and flinty ordinance of marriage.  For if the meaning of these words must be thus blockt up within their <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> letters from all equity and fair deduction, they will serve then well indeed their turn, who affirme divorce to have been granted <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> for wives; whenas we see no word of this text that bindes women, but men only, what it binds.  No marvell then if <span class="mi">Salomith</span> sister to <span class="mi">Herod</span>, sent a writ of ease to <span class="mi">Costobarus</span> her husband; which, as <a href="" id="Josephus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Josephus</span></a> there attests, was <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> to men.  No marvell though <span class="mi">Placidia</span> the sister of <span class="mi">Honorius</span> <span class="varspell" title="threatened">threat'n'd</span> the like to Earle <span class="mi">Constantius</span>, for a triviall cause, as <span class="mi">Photius</span> relates from <a href="" id="palisadoes" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Olympiodorus</span>. </a> No marvell any thing if letters must be <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> into palisadoes to stake out all requisite sense from entring to their due enlargement.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, Christ <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> tells who should not <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> put asunder, namely those whom God hath <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span>.  A plain solution of this great <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span>, if men would but use their eyes; for when is it that God may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> said to <span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span>, when the parties and their friends consent? No surely, for that may concurre to lewdest ends.  Or is it when Church rites are finisht? Neither; for the efficacie of those depends upon the presupposed <span class="varspell" title="fitness">fitnesse</span> of either party.  Perhaps, after carnall knowledge?  Least of all; for that may <span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span> persons whom neither law nor nature dares <span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span>: tis left, that only then, when the minds are fitly <span class="varspell" title="disposed">dispos'd</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="enabled">enabl'd</span> to maintain a <span class="varspell" title="cheerful">cheerfull</span> conversation, to the solace and love of each other, according as God intended and <span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span> in the very first foundation of matrimony, <span class="mi">I will make him a help meet for him</span>, for surely what God intended and <span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span>, that <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> can be thought to be of his <span class="varspell" title="joining">joyning</span>, and not the contrary.  So likewise the Apostle witnesseth, <a href="" id="cor7" class="annotBtn">1 <span class="mi">Cor. </span> 7.15</a>.  that in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> <span class="mi">God hath <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> us to peace</span>.  And <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span> in what respect he hath <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> us to <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, in that also <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> hath <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> us.  The rest whom either disproportion or <span class="varspell" title="deadness">deadnesse</span> of spirit, or something <span class="varspell" title="distasteful">distastfull</span> <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> averse in the immutable bent of nature renders unconiugall, error may have <span class="varspell" title="joined">ioyn'd</span>, but God never <span class="varspell" title="joined">ioyn'd</span> against the meaning of his own ordinance.  And if he ioynd them not, then is there no power above their own consent to hinder them from unioyning, when they cannot reap the sobrest ends of being together in any tolerable sort.  Neither can it be said properly that such twain were ever <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span>, but <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> parted from each other, as two persons unconjunctive and unmariable together.  But if, whom God hath made a fit help, <span class="varspell" title="frowardness">frowardnesse</span> or private injuries hath made unfit, that being the secret of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> God can better judge <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> man, neither is man indeed fit or able to decide this matter;  however it be, undoubtedly a <span class="varspell" title="peaceful">peacefull</span> divorce is a <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> in scandall <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a <span class="varspell" title="hateful">hatefull</span> hardhearted and destructive continuance of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, in the iudgement of Moses and of Christ, that iustifies him in choosing the <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, which if it were an honest and <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> prudence in the law, what is there in the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> forbidding such a kind of <span class="varspell" title="legal">legall</span> wisdom, though <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> should admit <a href="" id="common" class="annotBtn">the common Expositers?</a>

<span class="msummary">The sentence of Christ concerning divorce how to be expounded.  What <span class="reversem">Grotius</span> hath observ'd.  Other additions</span>.
</p>


<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Having"><span class="minitial">H</span>aving</span> thus unfolded those ambiguous reasons, wherewith Christ, as his wont was, gave to the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> that came to sound him, such an answer as they <span class="varspell" title="deserved">deserv'd</span>, it will not be <span class="varspell" title="uneasy">uneasie</span> to explain the sentence it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> that now follows; <span class="mi">Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery</span>.<a href="" id="adultery" class="annotBtn">*</a>  First <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> I will set down what is <span class="varspell" title="observed">observ'd</span> by <a href="" id="grotty" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Grotius</span></a> upon this point, a man of <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> learning.  Next I produce what mine own thoughts gave me, before I had seen his annotations.  <span class="mi">Origen</span>, saith he, notes that Christ <span class="varspell" title="named">nam'd</span> adultery rather as one example of other like cases, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> as one only exception.  And that is frequent, not only in human but in divine Laws, to <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> one kind of fact, <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> other causes of like nature may have the like plea: as <a href="" id="Exod21" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Exod</span>.  21.18, 19, 20</a><a href="" id="comma" class="annotBtn">,</a> 26.  <a href="" id="deut19" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr></span>  19. 5. </a> And from the maxims of civil Law he <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> that <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> in sharpest penal laws, the same reason hath the same right: and in gentler <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span>, that from like causes to like the Law interprets rightly.  But it may be objected, saith <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>, that nothing destroyes the end of wedlock so much as adultery.  To which he answers, that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> was not <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordaind</span> only for copulation, but for mutuall help and comfort of life; and if we mark diligently the nature of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviours</span> commands, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> shall <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> that both their beginning and their end consists in charity; whose will is that <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> should so be good to others, as that <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> not cruell to our selves.  And hence it appeares why <span class="mi">Marke</span>, and <span class="mi">Luke</span>, and S.  <span class="mi">Paul</span> to the <span class="mi">Cor</span>.  mentioning <a href="" id="precept" class="annotBtn">this precept of Christ</a>, adde no exception: because exceptions that arise from <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> equity, are included silently under <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> terms: it would <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="considered">consider'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> whether the same equity may not have place in other cases <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> frequent.  Thus <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> he.  From hence, is what I adde: first, that this saying of Christ, as it is usually expounded, can be no law at all, that a man for no cause should separate but for adultery, except it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a <span class="varspell" title="supernatural">supernaturall</span> law, not binding us as we now are had it <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> the law of nature, either the Jews, or some other wise and <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> nation would have <span class="varspell" title="pressed">pres't</span> it: or let it be so; yet that law, <a href="" id="deuter24" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr></span>  24.1</a>.  <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> a man hath leave to part, when as for just and <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> cause <span class="varspell" title="discovered">discover'd</span> he cannot love, is a law ancienter and deeper <span class="varspell" title="ingraven">ingrav'n</span> in blameles nature <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the other: <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> the inspired Law-giver Moses took care that this should be <span class="varspell" title="specified">specify'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span>: the other he let vanish in silence, not once repeated in the volume of his law, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> as the reason of it vanisht with Paradise.  Secondly, this can be no new command, for the Gospel
 <span class="varspell" title="enjoins">enjoyns</span> no new morality, save only the infinit
enlargement of charity, which in this respect is <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> the
<a href="" id="new" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">new commandement</span></a> by S. <span class="mi">John</span>; as being the accomplishment of every command.  Thirdly, It is no command of
perfection further <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> it partakes of charity, which is
<a href="" id="bond" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">the bond of perfection</span></a>.  Those commands <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> which
compell us to self cruelty above our strength, so hardly
will help forward to perfection, that they hinder and set
backward in all the common rudiments of Christianity,
as was <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span>.  It being thus clear, that the words of
Christ can be no kind of command, as they are vulgarly
<span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span>, we shall now see in what <span class="varspell" title="sense">sence</span> they may be a
command, and that an excellent one, the same with that
of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, and no other.  <span class="mi">Moses</span> had granted that only for
a natural annoyance, defect, or dislike, whether in body
or mind (for so the <a href="" id="Hebrew" class="annotBtn">Hebrew words</a> plainly note) which
a man could not force <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> to live with, he might
give a bill of divorce, <span class="varspell" title="thereby">therby</span> forbidding any other cause
<span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> amendment or reconciliation might have place.
This Law the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> depraving, extended to any slight
contentious cause whatsoever.  Christ <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> seeing
where they halted, urges the negative part of that law,
which is necessarily understood (for the determinate
permission of <span class="mi">Moses</span> binds them from further licence)
and checking their supercilious drift, declares that no
accidental, temporary, or reconcileable offence, except
fornication, can justify a divorce: he touches not here
those natural and perpetual hindrances of society,
whether in body or mind, which are not to be <span class="varspell" title="removed">remov'd</span>:
for such, as they are aptest to cause an unchangeable
offence, so are they not capable of reconcilement because not of amendment; they do not break indeed, but
they annihilate the bands of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
adultery.  For that fault committed argues not alwaies a
hatred either natural or <a href="" id="incidental" class="annotBtn">incidental</a> against whom it is
committed; neither does it inferre a disability of all
future helpfulnes, or loyalty, or loving agreement, being
once past, and <span class="varspell" title="pardoned">pardon'd</span>, where it can be <span class="varspell" title="pardoned">pardon'd</span>: but
that which naturally distasts, and <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="finds">findes</span> no <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> in the
eyes</span> of matrimony, can never be <span class="varspell" title="concealed">conceal'd</span>, never
<span class="varspell" title="appeased">appeas'd</span>, never intermitted, but proves a perpetuall
nullity of love and contentment, a solitude, and dead
vacation of all acceptable conversing.  <span class="mi">Moses</span> <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span>
permits divorce, but in cases only that have no hands to
<span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span>, and more need separating <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> adultery.  Christ
forbids it, but in matters only that may accord, and
those <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> fornication.  Thus is <span class="mi">Moses</span> Law here
plainly <span class="varspell" title="confirmed">confirm'd</span>, and those causes which he permitted,
not a jot gainsaid.  And that this is the true meaning of
this place, I prove by no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> an Author <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> S.  <span class="mi">Paul</span> himself, <a href="" id="cor710" class="annotBtn">1 <span class="mi">Cor</span>.  7.10, 11. </a> upon which text Interpreters agree that the Apostle only repeats the precept of Christ: where while he speaks of <span class="mi">the wives reconcilement to her husband</span>, he puts it out of <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span>, that our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> meant chiefly matters of strife and reconcilement: of which sort he would not that any difference should be the occasion of divorce, except fornication.  And that we may learn better how to value a grave and prudent law of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, and how unadvisedly we smatter with our lips, when we talk of Christs abolishing any <span class="varspell" title="Judicial">Judiciall</span> law of his great Father, except in some circumstances which are Judaicall rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> Judicial, and need no abolishing, but cease of themselvs, I say again, that this recited law of <span class="mi">Moses</span> contains a cause of divorce greater beyond compare <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that for adultery; and whoso cannot so conceive it, errs and wrongs exceedingly a law of deep wisdom for want of well fadoming.  For let him mark, no man urges the just divorcing of adultery, as it is a sin, but as it is an injury to <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>; and though it be but once committed, and that without malice, whether through importunity or opportunity, the Gospel does not <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> <span class="varspell" title="dissuade">disswade</span> him who would <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> divorce; but that natural hatred whenever it arises, is a greater evil in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the accident of adultery, a greater defrauding, a greater injustice, and yet not blameable, he who understands not after all this representing, I doubt his will like a hard spleen draws faster <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> his understanding can well <a href="" id="sanguifie" class="annotBtn">sanguifie</a>.  Nor did that man ever know or feel what it is to love truly, nor ever yet comprehend in his thoughts what the true intent of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is.  And this also will be somwhat above his reach, but yet no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> a truth for lack of his perspective, that as no man apprehends what vice is, so well as he who is truly vertuous, no man knows hel like him who <a href="" id="converses" class="annotBtn">converses most in <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span></a>, so there is none that can estimate the evil and the affliction of a <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> hatred in matrimony, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> he have a soul gentle <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> and spacious <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to contemplate what is true love.
</p>

<p>
And the reason why men so disesteem this wise judging Law of God, and count hate, or <span class="mi">the not finding of <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span></span>, as it is there <span class="varspell" title="termed">term'd</span>, a <a href="" id="humorous" class="annotBtn">humorous</a>, a dishonest, and slight cause of divorce, is because themselves apprehend so little of what true concord means: for if they did they would be juster in their ballancing between natural hatred and casuall adultery; this being but a transient injury, and soon amended, I mean as to the party against whom the <span class="varspell" title="trespass">trespasse</span> is: but the other being an unspeakable and unremitting sorrow and offence, <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> no amends can be made, no cure, no ceasing but by divorce, which <a href="" id="divine" class="annotBtn">like a divine touch</a> in one moment heals all; and like the word of a God, in one instant hushes outrageous tempests into a sudden <span class="varspell" title="stillness">stilnesse</span> and <span class="varspell" title="peaceful">peacefull</span> calm.  Yet all this so great a good of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> own enlarging to us, is by the <a href="" id="rains" class="annotBtn">hard rains</a> of them that sit us<a href="" id="comma2" class="annotBtn">,</a> wholly diverted and <span class="varspell" title="embezzled">imbezzl'd</span> from us.  Maligners of mankind!  But who hath taught ye to mangle thus, and make more gashes in the miseries of a <span class="varspell" title="blameless">blamelesse</span> creature, with the leaden daggers of your <span class="varspell" title="literal">literall</span> decrees, to whose ease you cannot adde the tithe of one small atome, but by letting alone your <span class="varspell" title="unhelpful">unhelpfull</span> Surgery.  As for such as think wandring concupiscence to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> here newly and more precisely <span class="varspell" title="forbidden">forbidd'n</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> it was before, if the Apostle can convince them; we know that we are to <a href="" id="lust" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">know lust by the law</span></a>, and not by any new discovery of the Gospel.  The Law of <span class="mi">Moses</span> knew what it permitted, and the Gospel knew what it forbid, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> that under a peevish conceit of debarring concupiscence, shall <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> about to make a novice of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, (not to say a worse thing for reverence sake) and such a one of God <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, as is a horror to think, to bind our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> in the default of a down-right promise breaking, and to bind the disunions of complaining nature in chains together, and curb them with a canon bit, tis he that commits all the whordom and adultery, which <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> adjudges, besides the former guilt so manifold that lies upon him.  And if none of these considerations with all their wait and gravity, can avail to the dispossessing him of his pretious literalism, let some one or other entreat him but to read on in the same 19.  of <span class="mi">Math</span>.  till he come to that place that sayes, <span class="mi">Some make <a href="" id="themselves" class="annotBtn">themselves</a> Eunuchs for the kingdom of heaves sake</span>.

<span class="msummary">Whether the words of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> be rightly expounded
	only of actual fornication to be the cause of divorce.  The
	opinion of <span class="reversem">Grotius</span>, with other reasons</span>.
</p>


<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="But"><span class="minitial">B</span>ut</span> because we know that Christ never gave a <span class="varspell" title="Judicial">Judiciall</span> Law, and that the word <a href="" id="fornication" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">fornication</span></a> is variously significant in Scripture, it <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> be much right done to our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> words, to consider diligently, whether it be meant <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> that nothing but actuall fornication, <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> by witnes, can warrant a divorce, for so our cannon law judges.  Nevertheless as I find that <span class="mi">Grotius</span> on this place hath <span class="varspell" title="observed">observ'd</span> the Christian <span class="varspell" title="Emperors">Emperours</span>, <span class="mi">Theodosius</span> the second, and <span class="mi">Justinian</span>, <a href="" id="high" class="annotBtn">men of high wisdom</a> and reputed piety, decreed it to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a divorsive fornication, if the wife attempted either against the knowledge, or obstinatly against the will of her husband, such things as gave open suspicion of adulterizing: as the <span class="varspell" title="willful">wilfull</span> haunting of feasts, and invitations with men not of her neer kindred, the lying forth of her house without probable cause, the frequenting of Theaters against her husbands mind, her <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> to prevent or destroy conception.<a href="" id="divorsive" class="annotBtn">*</a>  Hence that of <span class="mi">Jerom</span>, <span class="mi">Where fornication is suspected, the wife may lawfully be <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span></span>; not that every motion of a jealous mind should be regarded, but that it should not be exacted to prove all things by the visibility of Law witnessing, or <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> to hood-wink the mind: for the law is not able to judge of these things but by the rule of equity, and by permitting a wise man to walk the middle way of prudent circumspection, neither wretchedly jealous, nor stupidly and tamely patient.  To this purpose hath <span class="mi">Grotius</span> in his notes.  He <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> also that fornication is <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> in Scripture for such a continual headstrong <span class="varspell" title="behavior">behaviour</span>, as tends to plain contempt of the husband: and proves it out of <span class="mi">Judges</span> 19.2.  where the Levites wife is said to have plaid the whoor against him; which <a href="" id="Iosephus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Iosephus</span></a> and the <span class="mi">Septuagint</span>, with the <span class="mi">Chaldaean</span>, interpret <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> of <span class="varspell" title="stubborness">stubbornesse</span> and rebellion against her husband: and to this I adde that <span class="mi">Kimchi</span>, and the two <a href="" id="rabbies" class="annotBtn">other <span class="varspell" title="Rabbis">Rabbies</span></a> who glosse the text, are in the same opinion<a href="" id="period" class="annotBtn">.</a>  <span class="mi">Ben Gersom</span> reasons, that had it <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> whoordom, a Jew and a Levit would have <span class="varspell" title="disdained">disdain'd</span> to fetch her again.  And this I shall contribute, that had it been whoordom, she would have chosen any other place to run to, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to her fathers house, it being so infamous for an Hebrew woman to play the harlot, and so opprobrious to the parents.  Fornication then in this place of the <span class="mi">Iudges</span> is understood for stubborn disobedience against the husband, and not for adultery.  A sin of that sudden activity as to be already committed, when no more is done, but <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="looked">lookt</span> <span class="varspell" title="unchastely">unchastly</span>: which yet I should <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> loath to judge worthy a divorce, though in <a href="" id="language" class="annotBtn">our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviour's</span> language</a> it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> called adultery.  <span class="varspell" title="Nevertheless">Neverthelesse</span> when palpable and frequent <span class="varspell" title="signs">signes</span> are <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span>, the law of God, <a href="" id="numb5" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Numb</span>.  5</a>.  so far gave way to the jealousie of a man as that the woman set before the Sanctuary with her head <span class="varspell" title="uncovered">uncover'd</span>, was <span class="varspell" title="adjured">adjur'd</span> by the Priest to swear whether she were false or no; and <span class="varspell" title="constrained">constrain'd</span> to drink that <span class="mi">bitter water</span> with an undoubted <span class="mi">curse of <span class="varspell" title="rottenness">rottennesse</span> and tympany</span> to follow, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> she were innocent.  And the jealous man had not <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> guiltles before God, as seems by the last verse, if having such a suspition in his head, he should neglect his triall; which if to this day it be not to be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, or be thought as uncertain of effect as our antiquated law of <a href="" id="Ordalium" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ordalium</span></a>, yet all equity will judge that many adulterous demeanors which are of lewd suspicion and example, may be held sufficient to incurre a divorce, though the act it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> hath not been <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span>.  And seeing the generosity of our Nation is so, as to account no reproach more abominable, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <a href="" id="nicknam" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="nicknamed">nicknam'd</span></a> the husband of an adultresse, that our law should not be as ample as the Law of God to vindicate a man from that ignoble sufferance, is our barbarous <span class="varspell" title="unskillfulness">unskilfulnesse</span>, not considering that the law should be exasperated according to our estimation of the injury.  And if it must be <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> till the act be visibly <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span>, <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Solomon">Salomon</span></span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> whose judgement will be granted to <span class="varspell" title="surpass">surpasse</span> the <span class="varspell" title="acuteness">acutenesse</span> of any Canonist, confesses, <a href="" id="prov30" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Pro. </span> 30.19</a><a href="" id="comma3" class="annotBtn">,</a> 20.  that for the act of adultery, it is as difficult to be found as the <span class="mi">track of an Eagle in the aire, or the way of a ship in the Sea</span>: so that a man may be put to <a href="" id="unmanly" class="annotBtn">unmanly indignities</a>, ere it be found out.  This <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to inform us, that divorsive adultery is not limited by our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> to the utmost act, and that to be attested <span class="varspell" title="always">alwayes</span> by eye <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnesse</span>, but may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> extended also to divers obvious actions, which either plainly lead to adultery, or give such presumption, <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> sensible men may suspect the deed to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> already <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>.  And this the rather may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> thought, in that our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> chose to use the word <a href="" id="fornication" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Fornication</span></a>, which word is found to signifie other matrimoniall transgressions of main breach to that <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> besides actuall adultery.  For that <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinne</span> needed not the riddance of divorce, but of death by the Law, which was active <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> till then by the example of <a href="" id="woman" class="annotBtn">the woman <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> in adultery</a>; or if the law had been dormant, our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> was more likely to have told them of their neglect, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to have let a capitall crime silently <span class="varspell" title="escape">scape</span> into a divorce: or if it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> said his <span class="varspell" title="business">businesse</span> was not to tell them what was criminall in the <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> Courts, but what was <span class="varspell" title="sinful">sinfull</span> at the barre of conscience, how dare they then having no other ground <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> these our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> words, draw that into triall of law, which both by <span class="mi">Moses</span> and our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> was left to the jurisdiction of conscience?  But <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> take from our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>, say <a href="" id="they" class="annotBtn">they</a>, only that it was adultery and our Law of it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> applies the punishment.  But by their leave that so argue, the great Law-giver of all the world who knew best what was adultery both to the Iew and to the Gentile appointed no such applying, and never likes when mortall men will be vainly presuming to out-strip his justice.

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Thus"><span class="minitial">T</span>hus</span> at length <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> see both by this and by other	places, that there is scarce any one saying in the Gospel, but must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> read with limitations and distinctions, to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> rightly understood; for Christ gives no full comments or continued discourses, but as <a href="" id="Demetrius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Demetrius</span></a> the Rhetorician phrases it, speaks oft in Monosyllables, like a maister, scattering the heavenly grain of his doctrine like pearl <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> and there, which requires a <span class="varspell" title="skillful">skilfull</span> and laborious gatherer, who must compare the words he <span class="varspell" title="finds">findes</span>, with other precepts, with the end of every ordinance, and with the <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> <span class="mi">analogie</span> of Evangelick doctrine: otherwise many particular sayings would <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> but strange repugnant riddles; and the Church would offend in granting divorce for frigidity, which is not here excepted with adultery, but by them added.  And this was it undoubtedly which gave reason to S.  <span class="mi">Paul</span> of his own authority, as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> professes, and without command from the Lord, to enlarge the seeming construction of those places in the Gospel; by adding a case <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> a person deserted, which is somthing less <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span>, may lawfully marry again.  And having <span class="varspell" title="declared">declar'd</span> his opinion in one case, he leaves a <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> liberty for Christian prudence to determine in cases of like importance; using words so plain as are not to be shifted off, <span class="mi">that a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases</span>,<a href="" id="sister" class="annotBtn">*</a> adding also, that <span class="mi">God hath <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> us to peace</span> in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>.
</p>

<p>
Now if it be plain that a Christian may be brought into unworthy <span class="mi">bondage</span>, and his religious <span class="mi">peace</span> not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> interrupted now and then, but perpetually and finally <span class="varspell" title="hindered">hinder'd</span> in wedlock by mix-yoking with a diversity of nature as well as of religion, the reasons of S.  <span class="mi">Paul</span> cannot be made <span class="varspell" title="special">speciall</span> to that one case of infidelity, but are of equal moment to a divorce, wherever Christian liberty and peace are without fault equally obstructed.  That the ordinance which God gave to our comfort, may not be <span class="varspell" title="pinned">pinn'd</span> upon us to our undeserved thraldom; to be coopt up as it were in mockery of wedlock, to a perpetual betrothed lonelines and discontent, if nothing worse ensue.  There being nought <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> left between such, but a displeasing and <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> remedy against the sting of a <a href="" id="bruit" class="annotBtn">bruit</a> desire: which fleshly accustoming without the souls union and commixture of intellectuall delight, as it is rather a soiling <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a fulfilling of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>-rites, so it is <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to imbase the mettle of a generous spirit, and sinks him to a low and vulgar pitch of <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> in all his actions, or, which is wors, leavs him in a dispairing plight of abject <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> <span class="varspell" title="hardened">hardn'd</span> thoughts: which condition rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a good man should fal into, a man <span class="varspell" title="useful">usefull</span> in the service of God and mankind, Christ himself hath taught us to <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> with the most sacred ordinances of his worship, even for a bodily healing to <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span> with that holy and speculative rest of Sabbath, much more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> with the erroneous observance of an ill-knotted <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, for the sustaining of an <span class="varspell" title="overcharged">overcharg'd</span> faith and perseverance.

And he who to run after <a href="" id="lost" class="annotBtn">one lost sheep</a>, left ninety nine of his own flock at random in the wildernes, would little perplex his thought for the <a href="" id="obduring" class="annotBtn">obduring</a> of nine hunder<span class="varspell" title="hundred">hunder'd</span> and ninety such as will daily take worse liberties, whether they have permission or not.  To conclude, as without charity God hath <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> no commandment to men, so without it, neither can men rightly <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> any commandment <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span>.  For every act of true faith, as well that <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> we <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> the law, as that <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> we <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> the law, is wrought in us by charity, according to that in the divine hymne of S.  <span class="mi">Paul</span>, <a href="" id="1cor13" class="annotBtn">1 <span class="mi">Cor. </span> 13</a>.  <span class="mi">Charity <span class="varspell" title="believeth">beleeveth</span> all things</span>: not as if she were so credulous, which is the exposition hitherto current, for that were a trivial praise, but to teach us that charity is the high <span class="varspell" title="governess">governesse</span> of our beleefe, and that we cannot safely assent to any precept <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> in the Bible, but as charity commends it to us.  Which agrees with that of the same Apostle to the <a href="" id="ephes4" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ephes</span>.  4.14</a><a href="" id="comma4" class="annotBtn">,</a> 15.  where he tells us that the way to get a sure undoubted knowledge of things, is to hold that for truth, which accords most with charity.  Whose unerring guidance and conduct having <span class="varspell" title="followed">follow'd</span> as a load-starre with all diligence and fidelity in this question, I trust, through the help of that <a href="" id="Spirit" class="annotBtn">illuminating Spirit</a> which hath <span class="varspell" title="favored">favour'd</span> me, to have done no every days work: in asserting after many ages the words of Christ with other Scriptures of great concernment from burdensom <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> remorsles obscurity, <span class="varspell" title="tangled">tangl'd</span> with manifold repugnances, to their native lustre and consent between each other: hereby also dissolving tedious and <a href="" id="Gordian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Gordian</span></a> difficulties, which have hitherto molested the Church of God, and are now decided, not with the sword of <span class="mi">Alexander</span>, but with the immaculate hands of charity, to the unspeakable good of Christendome.  And let the extreme literalist sit down now and revolve whether this in all necessity be not the due result of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> words: or if he persist to be otherwise <span class="varspell" title="opinioned">opinion'd</span>, let him well advise, lest thinking to gripe fast the Gospel, he be found in stead with the canon law in his fist: whose boisterous edicts tyrannizing the blessed ordinance of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> into the quality of a most unnatural and unchristianly yoke, have <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> the flesh this advantage to hate it, and turn aside, oft times unwillingly, to all dissolute <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleannesse</span>, even till punishment it self is weary, and overcome by the incredible frequency of trading lust, and <span class="varspell" title="uncontrolled">uncontroull'd</span> adulteries.  Yet men whose Creed is <a name="custom">custom</a>, I doubt not but <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> be still <span class="varspell" title="endeavoring">endeavouring</span> to hide the sloth of their own timorous capacities with this pretext, that for all this tis better to endure with patience and silence this affliction which God hath sent.  And I agree tis true, if this be exhorted and not <span class="varspell" title="enjoined">enjoyn'd</span>; but withall it will be wisely <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> to be as sure as may be, that what <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> iniquity hath laid on, be not imputed to <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> sending, least under the <span class="varspell" title="color">colour</span> of an affected patience we detain our selves at the gulphs mouth of many hideous temptations, not to be withstood without proper gifts, which, <a href="" id="well" class="annotBtn">as <span class="mi">Perkins</span> well notes</a>, God gives not ordinarily, no not to most earnest prayers.  <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> we pray, <a href="" id="Lead" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Lead us not into temptation</span></a>, a vain prayer, if having led our selves thither, we love to stay in that perilous condition.  God sends remedies, as well as <span class="varspell" title="evils">evills</span>; under which he who lies and groans, that may lawfully acquit <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, is accessory to his own ruin: nor will it excuse him, though he suffer through a sluggish fearfulnes to search <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span> what is <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>, for feare of disquieting the secure falsity of an old opinion.  Who doubts not but that it may be piously said, to him who would dismiss frigidity, bear your trial, take it, as if God would have you live this life of continence: if he exhort this, I hear him as an Angel, though he speak without warrant: but if he would compell me, I know him for Satan.  To him who divorces an adulteresse, Piety might say; Pardon her; you may <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> much mercy, you may win a soul: yet the law both of God and man leaves it freely to him.  For God loves not to plow out the heart of our <span class="varspell" title="endeavors">endeavours</span> with over-hard and sad tasks.  God delights not to make a drudge of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, whose actions must be al elective <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> <span class="varspell" title="unconstrained">unconstrain'd</span>.  <span class="varspell" title="Forced">Forc't</span> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span></span> is as a bolt overshot it goes neither forward nor backward, and does no good as it stands.  Seeing <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> that neither Scripture nor reason hath laid this unjust austerity upon divorce, we may resolve that nothing else hath wrought it, but that letter-bound servility of the Canon Doctors, supposing <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> to be a Sacrament, and out of the art they have to lay unnecessary burdens upon all men, to make a fair <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> in the fleshly observance of matrimony, though peace and love with all other coniugall respects fare never so ill.  And indeed the Papists who are the strictest forbidders of divorce, are the easiest libertines to admit of grossest <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleannesse</span>; as if they had a <span class="varspell" title="design">designe</span> by making wedlock a <a href="" id="supportlesse" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="supportless">supportlesse</span></a> yoke, to violate it most, under <span class="varspell" title="color">colour</span> of preserving it most inviolable: and withall delighting, as their mystery is, to make men the day-<span class="varspell" title="laborers">labourers</span> of their own afflictions, as if there were such a scarcity of miseries from abroad, that we should be made to melt our choycest home blessings, and coin them into crosses, for want <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> to hold commerce with patience.  If any <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> who shall hap to read this discourse, hath been through misadventure ill <span class="varspell" title="engaged">ingag'd</span> in this contracted <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> here <span class="varspell" title="complained">complain'd</span> of, and finds the fits and workings of a high impatience frequently upon him, of all those wild words which men in misery think to ease themselves by uttering, let him not <span class="varspell" title="open">op'n</span> his lips against the providence of <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span>, or tax the <span class="varspell" title="ways">wayes</span> of God and his divine truth: for they are equal, <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span>, and not burdensome; nor <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> they ever crosse the just and reasonable desires of men, nor involve this our portion of mortall life, into a necessity of <span class="varspell" title="sadness">sadnesse</span> and malecontent, by laws commanding over the unreducible <span class="mi">antipathies</span> of nature sooner or later found: but allow us to remedy and shake off those <span class="varspell" title="evils">evills</span> into which human error hath led us through the midst of our best intentions, and to support our incident extremities by that authentick precept of soveran charity; whose grand commission is to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> and to dispose over all the ordinances of God to man; that love <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> truth may advance each other to everlasting.  While we<a href="" id="comma5" class="annotBtn">,</a> literally superstitious through customary <span class="varspell" title="faintness">faintnesse</span> of heart, not venturing to pierce with our free thoughts into the full latitude of nature and religion, abandon our <a href="" id="selves" class="annotBtn">selves</a> to serve under the tyranny of usurpt opinions, suffering those ordinances which were allotted to our solace and reviving, to trample over us and hale us into a multitude of <span class="varspell" title="sorrows">sorrowes</span> which God never meant us.  And where he set us in a fair allowance of way, with honest liberty and prudence to our guard, we never leave subtilizing and casuisting till we have <span class="varspell" title="straitened">straitn'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="pared">par'd</span> that liberal path into a razors edge to walk on, between a precipice of unnecessary mischief on either side: and starting at every false Alarum we <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not know which way to set a foot forward with manly confidence and Christian resolution, through the confused ringing in our eares of <a href="" id="panick" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">panick</span></a> scruples and amazements.

<span class="msummary">That the matter of divorce is not to be <span class="varspell" title="tried">try'd</span> by law, but by

</p>


<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Another"><span class="minitial">A</span>nother</span> act of papall encroachment it was, to pluck the power and arbitrament of divorce from the master of family, into whose hands God and the law of all Nations had put it, and Christ so left it, preaching <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> to the conscience, and not authorizing a <span class="varspell" title="judicial">judiciall</span> Court to tosse about and divulge the unaccountable and secret reasons of disaffection between man and wife, as a thing most improperly answerable to any such kind of triall.  But the Popes of <span class="mi">Rome</span> perceiving the great revenue and high authority it would give them <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> over Princes, to have the iudging and deciding of such a main consequence in the life of man as was divorce, wrought so upon the superstition of those ages, as to divest them of that right which God from the beginning had entrusted to the husband: by which <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> they
subiected that ancient and naturally domestick
prerogative to an externall and unbefitting Judicature.
For <a name="earthlypower">although</a> differences in divorce about Dowries,
Jointures, and the like, besides the punishing of
adultery, ought not to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> without referring, if need
be, to the Magistrate, yet that the absolute and final
hindring of divorce cannot belong to any civil or earthly
power, against the will and consent of both parties, or
of the husband alone, some reasons will be here <span class="varspell" title="urged">urg'd</span> as
shall not need to decline the touch.  But first I shall recite
what hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> already <span class="varspell" title="yielded">yeilded</span> by others in <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> of
this opinion.  <a href="" id="Grotius2" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Grotius</span></a> and many more agree, that
notwithstanding what Christ spake therin to the
conscience, the Magistrate is not <span class="varspell" title="thereby">therby</span> <span class="varspell" title="enjoined">enjoyn'd</span>
ought against the preservation of civil peace, of
equity, and of convenience.  Among these <a href="" id="Fagius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Fagius</span></a> is most
remarkable, and gives the same liberty of pronouncing
divorce to the Christian Magistrate as the <span class="varspell" title="Mosaic">Mosaick</span> had.
<span class="mi">For whatever</span> saith he, <span class="mi">Christ spake to the regenerat, the
Iudge hath to deal with the vulgar: if <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> any through
<span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnesse</span> of heart will not be a tolerable wife or
husband, it will be <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> as well now as of old to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> the
bill of divorce, not by privat, but by <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span>e authority.
Nor doth Man separate them then, but God by his law of
divorce <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> by</span> Moses.  <span class="mi">What can hinder the Magistrate
from so doing, to whose government all outward things are
subject, to separate and remove from perpetual vexation
and no small danger, those bodies whose minds are already
separate: it being his office to procure peaceable and
convenient living in the Common-wealth; and being as
certain also, that they so necessarily separated cannot all
receive a single life</span>.  And this I observe that <a href="" id="divines" class="annotBtn">our divines</a>
<span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> generally condemn separation of bed and board,
without the liberty of second choice: if that <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> in
some cases be most purely necessary, as who so
blockish to deny, then is this also as <span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span>.  Thus
<span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> by others is already well stept, to inform us that
divorce is not a matter of Law but of Charity: if there
remain a furlong yet to end the question, these
following reasons may serve to gain it with any
apprehension not too unlearned, or too wayward.  First
because ofttimes the causes of seeking divorce reside so
deeply in the radical and innocent affections of nature,
as is not within the diocese of Law to tamper with.
Other relations may aptly <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> be held together by
a civil and vertuous love.  But the duties of man and wife are such as are chiefly conversant in that love, which is most ancient and <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span>; whose two prime statutes are to <span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span> it self to that which is good and acceptable and friendly; and to turn aside and depart from what is disagreeable, displeasing and unlike: of the two this latter is the strongest, and most equal to be regarded: for although a man may often be unjust in seeking that which he loves, yet he can never be unjust or blamable in retiring from his endles trouble and distast, whenas his tarrying can redound to no true content on either side.  Hate is of all things the mightiest divider, nay, is division it self.  To couple hatred <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> though wedlock try all her golden links, and borrow to her aid all the iron manacles and fetters of Law, it does but seek <a href="" id="sand" class="annotBtn">to twist a rope of sand</a>, which was a task, they say, that <span class="varspell" title="posed">pos'd</span> the divell.  And that sluggish feind in hell, <a href="" id="Ocnus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ocnus</span></a>, whom the Poems tell of, brought his idle cordage to as good effect, which never <span class="varspell" title="served">serv'd</span> to bind with, but to feed the Asse that stood at his elbow.  And that the restrictive Law against divorce, attains as little to bind any thing truly in a <span class="varspell" title="disjointed">disjoynted</span> <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, or to keep it bound, but servs only to feed the ignorance, and definitive impertinence of a doltish Canon, were no absurd allusion.  To hinder <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> those deep and serious regresses of nature in a reasonable soul parting from that <span class="varspell" title="mistaken">mistak'n</span> help which he justly seeks in a person created for him, recollecting himself from an unmeet help which was never meant, and to detain him by compulsion in such a <span class="varspell" title="unpredestined">unpredestin'd</span> misery as this, is in diameter against both nature and institution: but to interpose a jurisdictive power upon the inward and irremediable disposition of man, to command love and sympathy, to forbid dislike against the guiltles instinct of nature, is not within the Province of any Law to reach, and were indeed an uncommodious <span class="varspell" title="rudeness">rudenesse</span>, not a just power: for that Law may bandy with nature, and traverse her sage motions, was an error in <span class="mi">Callicles</span> the Rhetorician, whom <span class="mi">Socrates</span> from high principles confutes in <a href="" id="Gorgias" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Plato's Gorgias</span></a>.  If <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> divorce may be so natural, and that law and nature are not to <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> contrary, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to forbid divorce compulsively, is not only against nature, but against law.  Next it must be <span class="varspell" title="remembered">remember'd</span> that all law is for some good that may be frequently <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span> without the admixture of a worse inconvenience; and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> many grosse faults, as ingratitude and the like, which are too <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> within the soul, to be <span class="varspell" title="cured">cur'd</span> by constraint of law are left only to be wrought on by conscience and <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span>.  Which made <span class="mi">Aristotle</span> in the <a href="" id="l0th" class="annotBtn">l0th of his <span class="mi">Ethicks</span></a> to <span class="mi">Nicomachus</span>, aim at a kind of division of law into private or perswasive, and <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> or compulsive.  Hence it is that the law forbidding divorce, never attains to any good end of such prohibition, but rather multiplies evil.  For if natures <span class="varspell" title="resistless">resistlesse</span> sway in love or hate <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> once <span class="varspell" title="compelled">compell'd</span>, it grows <span class="varspell" title="careless">carelesse</span> of it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>, vitious, <span class="varspell" title="useless">uselesse</span> to friend, unserviceable and <span class="varspell" title="spiritless">spiritlesse</span> to the Common-wealth.  Which Moses rightly foresaw, and all wise Law-givers that ever knew man, what kind of creature he was.  The Parlament also and Clergy of England were not ignorant of this, when they consented that <a href="" id="eighth" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Harry</span> the eighth</a> might put away his Queen <span class="mi">Anne</span> of <span class="mi">Cleve</span>, whom he could not like after he had been wedded half a yeare; <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> it were that contrary to the proverb, they made a necessity of that which might have been a <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> in them to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>.  For even the freedome and eminence of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> creation gives him to be a Law in this matter to <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, being the head of the other Sex which was made for him: whom therefore though he ought not to injure, yet neither should he be <span class="varspell" title="forced">Forc't</span> to retain in society to his own overthrow, nor to <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> any judge therin above <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>.  It being also an unseemly affront to the <span class="varspell" title="sequestered">sequestr'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="veiled">vail'd</span> modesty of that sex, to have her <span class="varspell" title="unpleasingness">unpleasingnesse</span> and other concealments bandied up and down, and aggravated in open Court by those <span class="varspell" title="hired">hir'd</span> masters of tongue-fence.  Such uncomely exigencies it befell no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> a Majesty <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="mi">Henry</span> the eighth to be <span class="varspell" title="reduced">reduc't</span> to; who finding iust reason in his conscience to <span class="varspell" title="forgo">forgoe</span> <a href="" id="brothers" class="annotBtn">his brothers wife</a>, after many indignities of being deluded, and made a boy of by those his two Cardinall Judges, was <span class="varspell" title="constrained">constrain'd</span> at last, for want of other proof that she had been carnally known by Prince <span class="mi">Arthur</span>, <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> to uncover the <span class="varspell" title="nakedness">nakednesse</span> of that vertuous Lady, and to recite openly the obscene evidence of his brothers Chamberlain.  Yet it <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> God to make him see all the tyranny of <span class="mi">Rome</span>, by discovering this which they <span class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> over divorce; and to make him the beginner of a reformation to this whole Kingdome, by first asserting into his <span class="mi">familiary</span> power the right of just divorce.  Tis true, an adultresse cannot be <span class="varspell" title="shamed">sham'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> by any <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> proceeding: but that woman whose <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> is not <span class="varspell" title="appeached">appeach't</span>, is <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="injured">injur'd</span> by a silent dismission, being otherwise not illiberally dealt with, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to endure a <span class="varspell" title="clamoring">clamouring</span> debate of <span class="varspell" title="utterless">utterlesse</span> things, in a busines of that <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> secrecy and difficult discerning, as not to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> over-much <span class="varspell" title="questioned">question'd</span> by neerest friends.  Which drew that answer from the greatest and worthiest <span class="mi">Roman</span> of his time <span class="mi">Paulus Emilius</span>, being demanded why <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> would put
away his wife for no visible reason? <span class="mi">This Shoo</span> said he,
and held it out on his foot, <span class="mi">is a neat shoo, a new shoo, and
yet none of you know where it wrings me</span>: much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> by
the unfamiliar cognisance of a <span class="varspell" title="feed">fee'd</span> gamester can such
a private difference be <span class="varspell" title="examined">examin'd</span>, neither ought it.

Again, if Law aim at the firm establishment and preservation of matrimoniall faith, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> know that cannot thrive under violent means; but is the more violated.  It is not when two unfortunately met are by the Canon <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> to draw in that yoke an <span class="varspell" title="unmerciful">unmercifull</span> dayes work of sorrow till death <span class="varspell" title="unharness">unharnesse</span> 'em, that then the Law keeps <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> most unviolated and <span class="varspell" title="unbroken">unbrok'n</span>: but when the Law takes order that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> be accountant and responsible to perform that society, whether it be religious, <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span>, or corporal, which may be conscionably <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="claimed">claim'd</span> therein, or else to be <span class="varspell" title="dissolved">dissolv'd</span> if it cannot be undergone: This is to make <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> most indissoluble, by making it a iust and <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> dealer, a performer of those due helps which instituted the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span>, being otherwise a most uniust contract, and no more to be <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintain'd</span> under tuition of law, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the vilest fraud, or cheat, or theft that may be committed.  But because this is such a secret kind of fraud or theft, as cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="discerned">maintain'd</span> by Law, but only by the plaintife himself, <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to divorce was never caunted a <span class="varspell" title="political">politicall</span> or <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> offence neither to <span class="mi">Jew</span> nor <span class="mi">Gentile</span>, nor any iudicial intendment of Christ, further <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> could be <span class="varspell" title="discerned">discern'd</span> to transgresse the allowance of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, which was of necessity so large, that it doth all one as if it sent back the matter undeterminable at law, and intractable by rough dealing, to have instructions and admonitions <span class="varspell" title="bestowed">bestow'd</span> about it by them whose spirituall office is to adjure and to denounce, and so left to the conscience.  The Law can <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> appoint the iust and <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> conditions of divorce, and is to look how it is an injury to the <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span>, which in truth it can be none, as a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> separation; for if she consent, <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> has the Law to right her? or consent not; <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> is it either iust, and so <span class="varspell" title="deserved">deserv'd</span>; or if uniust, such in all likelihood was the divorcer, and to part from an uniust man is a <span class="varspell" title="happiness">happinesse</span>, and no iniury to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> lamented.  But suppose it be an iniury, the law is not able to amend it, unles she think it other <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a miserable redress to return back from whence she was <span class="varspell" title="expelled">expell'd</span>, or but intreated to be gone, or else to live apart still <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> without <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, a <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> widow.  Last, if it be to <span class="varspell" title="chasten">chast'n</span> the divorcer, what Law punishes a deed which is not <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span>, but natural, a deed which cannot certainly be found to be an injury, or how can it be <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span> by prohibiting the divorce, but that the innocent must equally partake both in the shame and in the smart.  So that which way soever we look the Law can to no <span class="varspell" title="rational">rationall</span> purpose forbid divorce, it can only take care that the conditions of divorce be not iniurious.  Thus then we see the trial of law how impertinent it is to this question of divorce, how <span class="varspell" title="helpless">helplesse</span> next, and then how <span class="varspell" title="hurtful">hurtfull</span>.

<span class="msummary">The last Reason, why divorce is not to be <span class="varspell" title="restrained">restrain'd</span> by Law, it being against the Law of nature and of Nations.

That this will not breed any worse inconvenience nor so bad as is now <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span></span>.
</p>


<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Therefore"><span class="minitial">T</span>herfore</span> the last reason why it should not be, is the example we have, not only from the noblest and wisest Common-wealths, guided by the clearest light of human knowledge, but also from the divine testimonies of God himself, lawgiving in person to a <span class="varspell" title="sanctified">sanctify'd</span> people.  That all this is true, who so desires to know at large with least pains, and expects not <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> overlong rehersals of that which is by others already so judiciously <span class="varspell" title="gathered">gather'd</span>, let him <span class="varspell" title="hasten">hast'n</span> to be acquainted with that noble volume written by our learned <a href="" id="nature" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Selden, Of the law of nature <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> of Nations</span></a>, a work more useful and more worthy to be <span class="varspell" title="perused">perus'd</span>, whosoever studies to be a great man in wisdom, equity, and justice, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> all those <span class="mi">decretals, and <a href="" id="sumles" class="annotBtn">sumles sums</a>,</span> which the <span class="mi">Pontificall Clerks</span> have doted on, ever since that unfortunat mother famously <span class="varspell" title="sinned">sinn'd</span> thrice, and <span class="varspell" title="died">dy'd</span> impenitent of her bringing into the world those two <span class="varspell" title="misbegotten">misbegott'n</span> infants, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> for ever infants <a href="" id="Gratian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Lombard</span> <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> <span class="mi">Gratian</span></a>, him the compiler of Canon iniquity, tother the <a href="" id="Tubalcain" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Tubalcain</span></a> of scholastick Sophistry, whose overspreading <span class="mi">barbarism</span> hath not only <span class="varspell" title="infused">infus'd</span> their own bastardy upon the fruitfullest part of human learning; not only dissipated and dejected the clear light of nature in us, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> of nations but hath tainted also the fountains of divine doctrine, <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> <span class="varspell" title="rendered">render'd</span> the pure and solid Law of God unbeneficial to us by their calumnious dunceries.  Yet this Law which their <span class="varspell" title="unskilfulness">unskilfulnesse</span> hath made liable to all ignominy, the purity and wisdom of this Law shall be the buckler of our dispute.  Liberty of divorce we claim not, we think not but from this Law; the dignity, the faith, the authority <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> is now grown among Christians, O astonishment! a <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> of no mean difficulty and envy to defend.  That it should not be counted a faltring <span class="varspell" title="dispense">dispence</span>; a flattring permission of sin, the bil of adultery, a snare, is the expence of all this apology.  And all that we solicite is, that it may be <span class="varspell" title="suffered">render'd</span> to stand in the place where God set it amidst the firmament of his holy Laws to shine, as it was wont, upon the weaknesses and errors of men perishing <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> in the sincerity of their honest purposes: for certain there is no memory of whordoms and adulteries left among us now, when this warranted freedom of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> own giving is made dangerous and discarded for a scrowle of licence.  It must be your suffrages and Votes, <a href="" id="men" class="annotBtn">O English men</a>, that this exploded decree of God and <span class="mi">Moses</span> may <span class="varspell" title="escape">scape</span>, and come off fair without the censure of a <span class="varspell" title="shameful">shamefull</span> abrogating: which, if yonder Sun ride sure, and mean not to break word with us to morrow, was never yet abrogated by our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>.  Give sentence, if you please, that the frivolous Canon may reverse the infallible judgement of <span class="mi">Moses</span> and his great director.  Or if it be the reformed writers, whose doctrine <span class="varspell" title="persuades">perswades</span> this rather, their reasons I dare affirm are all <span class="varspell" title="silenced">silenc't</span>, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> it be only this.  <a href="" id="paraeus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Par&aelig;us</span> on the Corinthians</a> would prove that <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnes</span> of heart in divorce is no more now to be permitted, but to be <span class="varspell" title="amerced">amerc't</span> with fine and imprisonment.  I am not willing to discover the forgettings of reverend men, yet here I must.  What article or clause of the whole new <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Cov'nant</span> can Par&aelig;us bring to exasperat the judicial Law, upon any infirmity under the Gospel? (I say infirmity, for if it were the high hand of sin, the Law as little would have <span class="varspell" title="endured">endur'd</span> it as the Gospel) it would not stretch to the <a href="" id="dividing" class="annotBtn">dividing of an inheritance</a>; it <a href="" id="condemn" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="refused">refus'd</span> to condemn adultery</a>, not that these things should not be <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> at Law, but to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> that the Gospel hath not the least influence upon judicial Courts, much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> to make them sharper, and more heavy; lest of all to arraine before a temporal Judge that which the Law without summons acquitted.  But saith he, the law was the time of youth, under violent affections, the Gospel in us is mature age, and ought to subdue affections.  True, and so ought the Law too, if they be found inordinat, and not <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> natural and blameles.  Next I distinguish that the time of the Law is <span class="varspell" title="compared">compar'd</span> to youth, and pupillage in respect of the ceremonial part, which led the <a href="" id="children" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span> as children</a> through corporal and garish rudiments, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> the fulnes of time should reveal to them the higher lessons of faith and redemption<a href="" id="period2" class="annotBtn">.</a>  This is not meant of the moral part, therin it soberly <span class="varspell" title="concerned">concern'd</span> them not to be babies, but to be men in good earnest: the sad and <span class="varspell" title="awful">awfull</span> majesty of that Law was not to be jested with; to bring a bearded nonage with lascivious dispensations before that throne, had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> a leud affront, as it is now a grosse mistake.  But what discipline is this Par&aelig;us to nourish violent affections in youth, by cockring and wanton indulgences, and to chastise them in mature age with a boyish rod of correction.  How much more coherent is it to Scripture, that the Law as a strict Schoolmaster should have <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span> every <span class="varspell" title="trespass">trespasse</span> without indulgence so <span class="varspell" title="baneful">banefull</span> to youth, and that the Gospel should now correct that by admonition and reproof only, in free and mature age, which was <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span> with stripes in the childhood and bondage of the Law.  What <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> it <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> then so fairly, much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> is to be whipt now, especially in penal Courts: and if it ought now to trouble the conscience, why did that angry accuser and condemner Law repreev it?  So then, neither from <span class="mi">Moses</span> nor from Christ hath the Magistrate any authority to proceed against it.  But what? Shall then the disposal of that power return again to the maister of family?  <span class="varspell" title="Wherefore">Wherfore</span> not?  Since God there put it, and the presumptuous Canon thence bereft it.  This only must be provided, that the ancient manner be <span class="varspell" title="observed">observ'd</span> in the presence of the Minister and other grave selected Elders; who after they shall have admonisht and prest upon him the words of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>, and he shall have protested in the faith of the eternal Gospel, and the hope he has of happy resurrection, that otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> thus he cannot <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, and thinks himself, and this his case not <span class="varspell" title="contained">contain'd</span> in that prohibition of divorce which Christ <span class="varspell" title="pronounced">pronounc't</span>, the matter not being of malice, but of nature, and so not capable of reconciling, to constrain him <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> were to unchristen him, to unman him, to <a href="" id="mountain" class="annotBtn">throw the mountain of <span class="mi">Sinai</span> upon him</a>, with the weight of the whole Law to boot, flat against the liberty and essence of the Gospel, and yet nothing available either to the sanctity of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, the good of husband, wife, or children, nothing profitable either to Church or Common-wealth, but <span class="varspell" title="hurtful">hurtfull</span> and pernicious to all these respects.  But this will bring in confusion.  Yet these cautious mistrusters might consider, that what they thus object, lights not upon this book, but upon that which I engage against them, the book of God, and of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, with all the <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> and providence which had forecast the worst of confusion that could succeed, and yet thought fit of such a permission.  But let them be of good cheer, it wrought so little disorder among the Jews, that from <span class="mi">Moses</span> till after the captivity, not one of the Prophets thought it worth rebuking; for that of <a href="" id="Malachy" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Malachy</span></a> well <span class="varspell" title="looked">lookt</span> into, will appeare to be, not against divorcing, but rather against keeping strange Concubines, to the vexation of their <span class="mi">Hebrew</span> wives.  If therefore we Christians may be thought as good and tractable as the Jews were, and certainly the prohibiters of divorce presume us to be better, then <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> confusion is to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span> for this among us, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> was among them.  If <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> worse, or but as bad, which lamentable examples confirm we are, then have we more, or at least as much need of this permitted law, as they to whom God <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> gave it (as they say) under a harsher <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span>.  Let not <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> the frailty of man <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> on thus inventing <span class="varspell" title="needless">needlesse</span> troubles to it self, to groan under the <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> imagination of a strictnes never <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> from above; <span class="varspell" title="enjoining">enjoyning</span> that for duty which is an impossible <abbr title="and">&amp;</abbr> vain supererogating.  <span class="mi">Be not righteous overmuch</span>, is the counsell of <a href="" id="Ecclesiastes" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ecclesiastes</span></a>, <span class="mi">why shouldst thou destroy thy <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>?</span>  Let us not be thus over-curious to strain at <a href="" id="atoms" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">atoms</span></a>, and yet to stop every vent and cranny of permissive liberty; lest nature wanting those needful pores, and breathing places which God hath not <span class="varspell" title="debarred">debar'd</span> our <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknesse</span>, either suddenly break out into some wide rupture of open vice, and frantick heresie, or else inwardly fester with repining and blasphemous thoughts, under an unreasonable and <span class="varspell" title="fruitless">fruitlesse</span> rigor of unwarranted law.  Against which <span class="varspell" title="evils">evills</span> nothing can more beseem the religion of the Church, or the wisedom of the State, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to consider timely and provide.  And in so doing let them not doubt but they shall vindicate the misreputed <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> of God and his great Lawgiver, by suffering him to give his own laws according to the condition of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> nature best known to him, without the unsufferable imputation of <span class="varspell" title="dispensing">dispencing</span> legally with many ages of <span class="varspell" title="ratified">ratify'd</span> adultery.  They shall recover the <a href="" id="misattended" class="annotBtn">misattended</a> words of Christ to the sincerity of their true sense from manifold contradictions, and shall open them with the key of charity.  Many helples Christians they shall raise from the depth of sadnes and distresse, utterly unfitted, as they are, to serve God or man: many they shall reclaime from obscure and giddy sects, many regain from dissolute and brutish licence, many from desperate <span class="varspell" title="hardness">hardnes</span>, if ever that were justly pleaded.  They shall set free many daughters of <span class="mi">Israel</span>, not wanting much of her sad plight <span class="mi">whom Satan had bound eighteen years</span>.<a href="" id="bound" class="annotBtn">*</a>  Man they shall restore to his just dignity, and prerogative in nature, preferring the souls free peace before the promiscuous draining of a carnall rage.  <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> from a perilous hazard and snare, they shall reduce to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a more certain <span class="varspell" title="haven">hav'n</span> and retirement of happy society; when they shall judge according to God and <span class="mi">Moses</span>, and how not then according to Christ? when they shall judge it more wisdom and goodnes to break that <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> seemingly and keep it really, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by compulsion of law to keep it seemingly, and by compulsion of blameles nature to break it really, at least if it were ever truly <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span>.  The vigor of discipline they may then turn with better successe upon the prostitute loosenes of the times, when men finding in themselves the infirmities of former ages, shall not be <span class="varspell" title="constrained">constrain'd</span> above the gift of God in them, to unprofitable and impossible observances, never <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> from the civilest, the wisest, the holiest Nations, whose other excellencies in <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> they never yet could <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span>.  Last of all, to those whose mind still is to maintain textuall restrictions, <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> the bare sound cannot consist somtimes with humanity, much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> with charity, I would ever answer by putting them in remembrance of a command above all commands, which they seem to have forgot, and who spake it; in comparison <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span>, this which they so exalt, is but a petty and subordinate precept.  <span class="mi">Let them <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span></span> <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> with whom I am loath to couple them, yet they will needs run into the same blindnes with the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>, <span class="mi">let them <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span></span> and consider well what this lesson means, <span class="mi">I will have mercy and not sacrifice</span>;<a href="" id="sacrifice" class="annotBtn">*</a> for on that <span class="mi">saying all the Law and Prophets depend</span>,<a href="" id="depend" class="annotBtn">*</a> much more the Gospel whose end and excellence is mercy and peace: Or if they cannot learn that, how will they hear this, which yet I shall not doubt to leave with them as a conclusion: That God the Son hath put all other things under his own feet; but his Commandments <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> hath left all <a href="" id="feet" class="annotBtn">under the feet of Charity</a>.
