<span class="varspell" title="If"><span class="minitial">I</span>f</span> men within themselves would be <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> by reason, and not generally give up <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> understanding to a <a href="" id="double" class="annotBtn">double <span class="varspell" title="tyranny">tyrannie</span></a>, of <a href="" id="custom" class="annotBtn">Custom</a> from without, and blind affections within, they would <span class="varspell" title="discern">discerne</span> better, what it is to <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> and uphold the Tyrant of a Nation. But being slaves within doors, no wonder that they strive so much to have the public State conformably <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> to the inward <span class="varspell" title="vicious">vitious</span> rule, by which they govern themselves. For indeed none can love freedom <span class="varspell" title="heartily">heartilie</span>, but good men; the rest love not freedom, but <span class="varspell" title="license">licence</span>; which never <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> more scope or more indulgence <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> under Tyrants.  Hence is it that Tyrants are not <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> <a href="" id="offended" class="annotBtn">offended</a>, nor stand much in doubt of bad men, as being all <a href="" id="naturally" class="annotBtn">naturally servile</a>;  but in whom <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> and true worth most is eminent, them they <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> in earnest, as by right <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="Masters">Maisters</span>, against them lies all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> hatred and suspicion.  <span class="varspell" title="Consequently">Consequentlie</span> neither <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> bad men hate Tyrants, but have been <span class="varspell" title="always">alwayes</span> readiest with the <span class="varspell" title="falsified">falsifi'd</span> names of <span class="mi">Loyalty,</span> and <span class="mi">Obedience,</span> to <span class="varspell" title="color">colour</span> over <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> base compliances.  And although <span class="varspell" title="sometimes">somtimes</span> for shame, and when it comes to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> grievances, of purse especially, they would <span class="varspell" title="seem">seeme</span> good Patriots, and side with the better cause, yet when others for the deliverance of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="Country">Countrie</span>, <span class="varspell" title="endued">endu'd</span> with fortitude and <span class="varspell" title="Heroic">Heroick</span> <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> to <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> nothing but the curse <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> against those <a href="" id="negligently" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">That <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> the <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> of the Lord negligently</span></a>, would <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> on to remove, not only the calamities and thraldoms of a People, but the roots and causes whence they spring, <span class="varspell" title="straight">streight</span> <a href="" id="men" class="annotBtn">these men</a>, and sure helpers at need, as if they hated only the miseries but not the mischiefs, after they have <span class="varspell" title="juggled">juggl'd</span> and <a href="" id="palterd" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="paltered">palter'd</span></a> with the world, bandied and born <span class="varspell" title="arms">armes</span> against <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> King, <span class="varspell" title="divested">devested</span> him, disannointed him, nay <span class="varspell" title="cursed">curs'd</span> him all over in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Pulpits and <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Pamphlets, to the <span class="varspell" title="engaging">ingaging</span> of sincere and real men, beyond what is possible or honest to retreat from, not only <span class="varspell" title="turn">turne</span> revolters from those principles, which only could at first move them, but lay the <span class="varspell" title="stain">staine</span> of <span class="varspell" title="disloyalty">disloyaltie</span>, and worse, on those proceedings, which are the necessary consequences of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own former actions; nor <span class="varspell" title="disliked">dislik'd</span> by themselves, were they <span class="varspell" title="managed">manag'd</span> to the <span class="varspell" title="entire">intire</span> advantages of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own <a href="" id="faction" class="annotBtn">Faction</a>;  not considering the while that <a href="" id="hewhom" class="annotBtn">he toward whom they boasted <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> new <span class="varspell" title="fidelity">fidelitie</span>,</a> counted them accessory; and by those Statutes and <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span> which they so impotently brandish  against others, would have <span class="varspell" title="doomed">doom'd</span> them to a <a href="" id="traytors" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Traitor's">Traytors</span> death</a>, for what they have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> <span class="varspell" title="already">alreadie</span>. 'Tis true, that most men are apt enough to <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> Wars and commotions as a <span class="varspell" title="novelty">noveltie</span>, and for a flash hot and active; but through sloth or <span class="varspell" title="inconstancy">inconstancie</span>, and weakness of spirit either fainting, ere <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own pretences, though never so just, be half <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span>, or through an inbred <span class="varspell" title="falsehood">falshood</span> and <span class="varspell" title="wickedness">wickednes</span>, betray <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> times to destruction with themselves, men of noblest temper <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> with them for causes, whereof they in their rash undertakings were not capable.</p>  

<p>If God and a good cause give them Victory, the prosecution wherof for the most part, inevitably draws after it the alteration of <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span>, change of <span class="varspell" title="Government">Goverment</span>, <span class="varspell" title="downfall">downfal</span> of Princes with <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> families; then comes the task to those Worthies which are the <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> of that <span class="varspell" title="enterprise">enterprize</span>, to be <span class="varspell" title="sweated">swett</span> and <span class="varspell" title="labored">labour'd</span> out amidst the throng and noises of <a href="" id="vulgar" class="annotBtn">Vulgar and irrational men</a>. Some contesting for privileges, customs, forms, and that old entanglement of Iniquity, <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <a href="" id="gibrish" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="gibberish">gibrish</span> <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span></a>, though the badge of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> ancient slavery. Others who have <span class="varspell" title="been">beene</span> fiercest against <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Prince, under the notion of a Tyrant, and no mean incendiaries of the <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> against him, when God out of his providence and high disposal <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliver'd</span> him into the hand of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> brethren, on a <span class="varspell" title="sudden">suddain</span> and in a new <span class="varspell" title="garb">garbe</span> of Allegiance, which <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> doings have long since <span class="varspell" title="cancelled">cancell'd</span>; they plead for him, pity him, <span class="varspell" title="extol">extoll</span> him, protest against those that talk of bringing him to the <span class="varspell" title="trial">tryal</span> of Justice, which is the Sword of God, superior to all mortal things, in whose hand soever by apparent <span class="varspell" title="signs">signes</span> his testified will is to put it. But certainly if we consider who and what they are, on a <span class="varspell" title="sudden">suddain</span> grown so <span class="varspell" title="pitiful">pitifull</span>, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> may conclude, <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="pity">pitty</span> can be no true, and Christian commiseration, but either <span class="varspell" title="levity">levitie</span> and shallowness of <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>, or else a carnal admiring of that worldly pomp and greatness, from whence they see him <span class="varspell" title="fallen">fall'n</span>; or rather lastly a <span class="varspell" title="dissembled">dissembl'd</span> and seditious pity, <span class="varspell" title="feigned">fain'd</span> of industry to <span class="varspell" title="beget">begett</span> new discord. As for mercy, if it be to a Tyrant, under which Name they themselves have cited him so <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> in the hearing of God, of Angels, and the holy Church <span class="varspell" title="assembled">assembl'd</span>, and there <span class="varspell" title="charged">charg'd</span> him with the spilling of more innocent blood by <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ever <a href="" id="nero" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Nero</span></a> did, undoubtedly the mercy which they pretend, is the mercy of wicked men; and their mercies, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> read are <a href="" id="cruelties" class="annotBtn">cruelties</a>; hazarding the welfare of a whole Nation, to have <span class="varspell" title="saved">sav'd</span> one, whom so <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> they have <span class="varspell" title="termed">tearm'd</span> <a href="" id="agag" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Agag</span></a>; and vilifying the blood of many <a href="" id="jonathans" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Jonathans</span></a>, that have <span class="varspell" title="saved">sav'd</span> <span class="mi">Israel</span>; insisting with much niceness on the <a href="" id="clause" class="annotBtn">unnecessariest clause</a> of <a href="" id="covnant" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span></a> wrested, wherein the <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> of change, and the absurd contradiction of a flattering <span class="varspell" title="hostility">hostilitie</span> had <span class="varspell" title="hampered">hamperd</span> them, but not scrupling to give away for <span class="varspell" title="compliments">complements</span>, to an implacable revenge, the heads of many thousand Christians more.
	</p>  
	<p>Another sort there is, who <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="course">cours</span> of these <span class="varspell" title="affairs">affaires</span>, to have <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> share in great actions, above the form of Law or Custom, at least to give <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <a href="" id="voice" class="annotBtn">voice</a> and approbation, begin to swerve, and almost shiver at the Majesty and grandeur of <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> noble deed, as if they were newly <span class="varspell" title="entered">enter'd</span> into a great sin; disputing <a href="" id="presidents" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="precedents">presidents</span></a>, forms, and circumstances, when the <span class="varspell" title="Commonwealth">Common-wealth</span> nigh perishes for want of deeds in substance, <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> with just and <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> expedition. To these I wish better instruction, and <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> equal to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> calling; the former of which, that is to say Instruction, I shall <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">indeavour</span>, as my <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> is, to bestow on them; and exhort them not to <a href="" id="startle" class="annotBtn">startle</a> from the just and pious resolution of adhering with all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> strength <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> assistance to the present <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> Army, in the glorious way <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> Justice and Victory <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> set them; the only warrants through all ages, next under <a href="" id="revelation" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="immediate">immediat</span> Revelation</a>, to exercise <span class="varspell" title="supreme">supream</span> power, in those proceedings which hitherto <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> equal to what <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> been <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> in any age or Nation heretofore, justly or <span class="varspell" title="magnanimously">magnanimouslie</span>. Nor let them be <span class="varspell" title="discouraged">discourag'd</span> or <span class="varspell" title="deterred">deterr'd</span> by any new Apostate <span class="varspell" title="Scarecrows">Scarcrowes</span>, who under show of giving counsel, send out their barking monitories and <a href="" id="memento" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="mementos">memento's</span></span></a>, empty of ought else but the <span class="varspell" title="spleen">spleene</span> of a frustrated Faction. For how can that pretended counsel <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> either sound or <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span>, when they that give it, see not for madness and vexation of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> ends lost, that those Statutes and Scriptures which both <span class="varspell" title="falsely">falsly</span> and scandalously, they wrest against <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Friends and Associates, would by sentence of the common <span class="varspell" title="adversary">adversarie</span>, fall first and heaviest upon <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own heads. Neither let <span class="varspell" title="mild">milde</span> and tender dispositions be foolishly <span class="varspell" title="softened">softn'd</span> from <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> duty and perseverance, with the <a href="" id="masculine" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="unmasculine">unmaskuline</span> <span class="varspell" title="Rhetoric">Rhetorick</span></a> of any <a href="" id="puling" class="annotBtn">puling</a> Priest or Chaplain, sent as a friendly Letter of advice, for fashion sake in <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span>, and forthwith <span class="varspell" title="published">publisht</span> by the Sender himself, that <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> may know how much of friend there was in it, to cast an odious <span class="varspell" title="envy">envie</span> upon them, to whom it was pretended to be sent in <span class="varspell" title="charity">charitie</span>. Nor let any man be deluded by either the ignorance or the notorious <span class="varspell" title="hypocrisy">hypocrisie</span> and self-repugnance of our dancing Divines, who have the conscience and the boldness, to come with Scripture in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="mouths">mouthes</span>, <span class="varspell" title="glossed">gloss'd</span> and fitted for <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="turns">turnes</span> with a double contradictory sense, transforming the sacred verity of God, to an Idol with two Faces, looking at once two several ways; and with the same quotations to charge others, which in the same case they made serve to <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> themselves. For while the hope to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> made <a href="" id="classic" class="annotBtn">Classic and Provincial Lords</a> led them on, while <a href="" id="pluralities" class="annotBtn">pluralities</a> <span class="varspell" title="greased">greas'd</span> them thick and deep, to the shame and scandal of Religion, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> all the Sects and Heresies they exclaim against, then to fight against the <span class="varspell" title="King's">Kings</span> person, and no less a Party of his Lords and Commons, or to put force upon <a href="" id="both" class="annotBtn">both the Houses</a>, was good, was <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>, was no <a href="" id="resisting" class="annotBtn">resisting of Superior powers</a>; they <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> were powers not to be resisted, who <span class="varspell" title="countenanced">countenanc'd</span> the good, and <span class="varspell" title="punished">punish't</span> the evil. But now that <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> censorious domineering is not <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> to be universal, truth and conscience to be freed, <a href="" id="tithes" class="annotBtn">Tithes</a> and <a href="" id="pluralities" class="annotBtn">Pluralities</a> to be no more, though competent allowance provided, and the <span class="varspell" title="warm">warme</span> experience of large gifts, and they so good at taking them; yet now to exclude <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> seize upon <a href="" id="impeacht" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="impeached">impeach't</span> Members</a>, to bring Delinquents without exemption to a <span class="varspell" title="fair">faire</span> Tribunal by the common National Law against murder, is now to be no less <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="" id="corah" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Corah, Dathan</span>, and <span class="mi">Abiram</span></a><span class="mi">. </span>  He who but erewhile in the Pulpits was a cursed Tyrant, an <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span> to God and Saints, <span class="varspell" title="laden">lad'n</span> with all the innocent blood <span class="varspell" title="spilled">spilt</span> in three Kingdoms, and so to be fought against, is now, though nothing penitent or <span class="varspell" title="altered">alter'd</span> from his first principles, a <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> Magistrate, a <span class="varspell" title="Sovereign">Sovran</span> Lord, the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> anointed, <a href="" id="touch" class="annotBtn">not to be <span class="varspell" title="touched">touch'd</span></a>, though by themselves <span class="varspell" title="imprisoned">imprison'd</span>. As if this <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> were obedience, to preserve the <span class="varspell" title="mere">meere</span> useless <span class="varspell" title="bulk">bulke</span> of his person, and that <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> in prison, not in the field, and to disobey his commands, deny him his dignity and office, every where to resist his power but where they <span class="varspell" title="think">thinke</span> it <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> surviving in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own faction.
	</p>  <p>But who in particular is a Tyrant cannot be <span class="varspell" title="determined">determin'd</span> in a general <span class="varspell" title="discourse">discours</span>, otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by supposition; his particular charge, and the suffficient proof of it must <span class="varspell" title="determine">determin</span> that: which I <a href="" id="leave" class="annotBtn">leave to Magistrates</a>, at least to the uprighter sort of them, and of the people, though in number less by many, in whom faction least <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="prevailed">prevaild</span> above the <a href="" id="law" class="annotBtn">Law of nature and right reason</a>, to judge as they find cause. But this I dare <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> as part of my faith, that if such a one there be, by whose Commission, whole <a href="" id="massachers" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="massacres">massachers</span></a> have been committed on his <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> Subjects, his Provinces <span class="varspell" title="offered">offerd</span> to pawn or alienation, as the hire of those whom he had <span class="varspell" title="solicited">sollicited</span> to come in and destroy whole <span class="varspell" title="Cities">Citties</span> and Countries; be he King, or Tyrant, or <span class="varspell" title="Emperor">Emperour</span>, the Sword of Justice is above him; in whose hand soever is found suffficient power to avenge the effusion, and so great a deluge of innocent blood. For if all human power to execute, not accidentally but intendedly, the wrath of God upon evil doers without exception, be of God; then that power, whether ordinary, or if that <span class="varspell" title="fail">faile</span>, extraordinary so executing that intent of God, is <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>, and <a href="" id="resisted" class="annotBtn">not to be resisted</a>. But to unfold more at large this whole Question, though with all expedient brevity, I shall here set <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span> from first beginning, <a href="" id="original" class="annotBtn">the original of Kings</a>; how and <span class="varspell" title="wherefore">wherfore</span> exalted to that <span class="varspell" title="dignity">dignitie</span> above <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Brethren; and from thence shall prove, that turning to Tyranny they may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> as lawfully <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="punished">punish'd</span>, as they were at first elected:  This I shall <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> by <span class="varspell" title="authorities">autorities</span> and reasons, not <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span> in corners among <span class="varspell" title="Schisms">Scisms</span> and Heresies, as our doubling Divines are ready to <a href="" id="calumniat" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="calumniate">calumniat</span></a>, but <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetch't</span> out of the midst of choicest and most authentic learning, and no prohibited Authors, nor many Heathen, but Mosaical, Christian, Orthodoxal, and which must needs be more convincing to our Adversaries, <a href="" id="presbyterial" class="annotBtn">Presbyterial</a>.
	</p>  <p>No man who knows ought, can be so stupid to deny that all men <a name="bornfree">naturally</a> were <a href="" id="borne" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="born">borne</span> free</a>, being the image and resemblance of God himself, and were by privilege above all the creatures, <a href="" id="born" class="annotBtn">born to command</a> and not to obey: and that they <span class="varspell" title="lived">liv'd</span> so. Till from the root of <a href="" id="adams" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Adam's">Adams</span> </span>  transgression</a>, falling among themselves to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> wrong and violence, and foreseeing that such courses must needs tend to the destruction of them all, they agreed by common league to bind each other from mutual injury, and <span class="varspell" title="jointly">joyntly</span> to defend themselves against any that gave disturbance or opposition to such agreement. Hence came <span class="varspell" title="Cities">Citties</span>, <span class="varspell" title="Towns">Townes</span> and <span class="varspell" title="Commonwealths">Common-wealths</span>. And because no faith in all was found sufficiently binding, they saw it needfull to <span class="varspell" title="ordain">ordaine</span> <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> <span class="varspell" title="authority">authoritie</span>, that might restrain by force and punishment what was violated against peace and common right. This <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> and power of <a href="" id="self-defence" class="annotBtn">self-defence and preservation</a> being originally and naturally in every one of them, and unitedly in them all, for ease, for order, and least each man should be his own partial Judge, they communicated and <span class="varspell" title="derived">deriv'd</span> either to one, whom for the eminence of his wisdom and <span class="varspell" title="integrity">integritie</span> they chose above the rest, or to more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> one whom they thought of equal deserving: the first was <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> a <a href="" id="aris-king" class="annotBtn">King</a>;  the other Magistrates. Not to be <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Lords and <span class="varspell" title="Masters">Maisters</span> (though afterward those names in <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> places were <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> voluntarily to such as had been Authors of inestimable good to the people) but, to be <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Deputies and Commissioners, to execute, by <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="entrusted">intrusted</span> power, that justice which else every man by the bond of nature and of <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Cov'nant</span> must have executed for himself, and for one another. And to him that shall consider well why among free Persons, one man by civil right should <span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span> <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> and jurisdiction over another, no other end or reason can be imaginable. These for a while <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> well, and with much equity decided all things at <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own arbitrement: till the temptation of such a power left absolute in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> hands, perverted them at length to injustice and <span class="varspell" title="partiality">partialitie</span>. Then did they who now by <span class="varspell" title="trial">tryal</span> had found the danger and inconveniences of committing arbitrary power to any, invent Laws either <span class="varspell" title="framed">fram'd</span>, or consented to by all, that should confine and limit the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of whom they chose to govern them: that so man, of whose failing they had proof, might no more rule over them, but law and reason abstracted as much as might be from personal errors and frailties.  While as the Magistrate was set above the people, so the Law was set above the Magistrate.  When this would not serve, but that the Law was either not executed, or <span class="varspell" title="misapplied">misapply'd</span>, they were <span class="varspell" title="constrained">constrain'd</span> from that time, the <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> remedy left them, to put conditions and take Oaths from all Kings and Magistrates at <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> first <span class="varspell" title="installment">instalment</span> to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> impartial justice by Law: who upon those <span class="varspell" title="terms">termes</span> and no other, <span class="varspell" title="received">receav'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span> from the people, that is to say, bond or <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> to obey them in execution of those <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span> which they the people had themselves made, or assented to. And this ofttimes with express warning, that if the King or Magistrate <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="unfaithful">unfaithfull</span> to his trust, the people would be <span class="varspell" title="disengaged">disingag'd</span>. They added also Counselors and <span class="varspell" title="Parliaments">Parlaments</span>, nor to be <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> at his beck, but with him or without him, at set times, or at all times, when any danger <span class="varspell" title="threatened">threatn'd</span> to have care of the public safety. Therefore saith <a href="" id="sesell" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Claudius Sesell</span></a> a French Statesman, <span class="mi">The Parliament was set as a bridle to the King</span>; which I instance rather, not because our English Lawyers have not said the same long before, but because that French Monarchy is granted by all to be a <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> more absolute <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ours. That this and the rest of what <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> hitherto been <span class="varspell" title="spoken">spok'n</span> is most true, might be copiously made <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> throughout all Stories Heathen and Christian; <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> of those Nations where Kings and <span class="varspell" title="Emperors">Emperours</span> have sought <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> to abolish all ancient memory of the <span class="varspell" title="People's">Peoples</span> right by <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> encroachments and usurpations. But I spare long insertions, appealing to the known constitutions of both the latest Christian Empires in Europe, the Greek and <a href="" id="german" class="annotBtn">German</a>, besides the French, <a href="" id="italian" class="annotBtn">Italian</a>, <a href="" id="arragonian" class="annotBtn">Arragonian</a>, English, and not least the <a href="" id="scottish" class="annotBtn">Scottish Histories</a>: not forgetting this <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> by the way, that <span class="mi">William </span> the Norman though a <a href="" id="conqueror" class="annotBtn">Conqueror</a>, and not unsworn at his Coronation, was <span class="varspell" title="compelled">compell'd</span> the second time to take oath at  <a href="" id="albanes" class="annotBtn">S. <span class="mi">Albanes</span></a>, ere the people would be brought to <span class="varspell" title="yield">yeild</span> obedience.
 	</p>  <p>It being thus manifest that the power of Kings and Magistrates is nothing else, but what is only derivative, <span class="varspell" title="transferred">transferr'd</span> and committed to them in trust from the People, to the Common good of them all, in whom the power yet <span class="varspell" title="remains">remaines</span> fundamentally, and cannot be <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> from them, without a violation of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> natural birthright, and seeing that from hence <a href="" id="nicomachean" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Aristotle</span></a>  and the best of Political writers have <span class="varspell" title="defined">defin'd</span> a King, him who governs to the good and profit of his People, and not for his own ends, it follows from necessary causes, that the Titles of <span class="varspell" title="Sovereign">Sov'ran</span> Lord, natural Lord, and the like, are either arrogancies, or flatteries, not admitted by <span class="varspell" title="Emperors">Emperours</span> and Kings of best note, and <span class="varspell" title="disliked">dislikt</span> by the Church both of Jews, <a href="" id="isai" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isai.</abbr></span>  26.13</a>. and ancient Christians, as appears by <a href="" id="tertullian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Tertullian</span></a>  and others.  Although generally the people of Asia, and with them the Jews also, especially since the time they chose a <a href="" id="king" class="annotBtn">King</a> against the advice and counsel of God, are noted by wise Authors much <a href="" id="inclinable" class="annotBtn">inclinable to slavery</a>.
	</p>  <p>Secondly, that to say, as is usual, the King <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> as good right to his Crown and <span class="varspell" title="dignity">dignitie</span>, as any man to his inheritance, is to make the Subject no better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <span class="varspell" title="King's">Kings</span> slave, his <span class="varspell" title="chattel">chattell</span>, or his possession that may be bought and <span class="varspell" title="sold">sould</span>. And doubtless if hereditary title were sufficiently <span class="varspell" title="inquired">inquir'd</span>, the best foundation of it would be found either but in <span class="varspell" title="courtesy">courtesie</span> or convenience. But suppose it to be of right <span class="varspell" title="hereditary">hereditarie</span>, what can be more just and legal, if a subject for certain crimes be to <span class="varspell" title="forfeit">forfet</span> by Law from himself, and posterity, all his inheritance to the King, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that a King for crimes proportional, should <span class="varspell" title="forfeit">forfet</span> all his title and inheritance to the people: unless the people must be thought created all for him, he not for them, and they all in one body inferior to him single, which were a <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of treason against the <span class="varspell" title="dignity">dignitie</span> of mankind to affirm.
	</p>  <p>Thirdly it follows, that to say Kings are <a href="" id="accountable" class="annotBtn">accountable to none but God</a>, is the overturning of all Law and government. For if they may refuse to give account, then all <span class="varspell" title="covenants">cov'nants</span> made with them at Coronation; all <span class="varspell" title="Oaths">Oathes</span> are in <span class="varspell" title="vain">vaine</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> mockeries, all <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span> which they <span class="varspell" title="swear">sweare</span> to keep, made to no purpose; for if the King <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> not God, as how many of them <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not? we hold then our lives and estates, by the tenure of his <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> grace and mercy, as from a God, not a mortal Magistrate, a position that none but Court Parasites or men besotted would maintain. <span class="mi">Aristotle </span>  therefore, whom we commonly allow for one of the best interpreters of nature and morality, writes in the <a href="" id="fourth" class="annotBtn">fourth of his politics <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> 10</a>. that Monarchy unaccountable, is the worst sort of Tyranny; and least of all to be <span class="varspell" title="endured">endur'd</span> by free born men.  And surely no Christian Prince, not drunk with high mind, and prouder <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> those Pagan <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Caesars">C&aelig;sars</span></span> that <span class="varspell" title="deified">deifi'd</span> themselves, would arrogate so unreasonably above human condition, or derogate so basely from a whole Nation of men his Brethren, as if for him only subsisting, and to serve his glory; valuing them in comparison of his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> brute will and pleasure, no more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> so many beasts, or vermin under his Feet, not to be <span class="varspell" title="reasoned">reasond</span> with, but to be trod on; among whom there might be found so many thousand Men for wisdom, <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, nobleness of mind, and all other respects, but the fortune of his dignity, <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> above him. Yet some would <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> us, that this absurd opinion was King <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="David's">Davids</span></span>; because in the 51 <span class="mi">Psalm </span>  he cries out to God, <a href="" id="against" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Against thee <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> have I <span class="varspell" title="sinned">sinn'd</span></span></a>;  as if <span class="mi">David </span>  had <span class="varspell" title="imagined">imagin'd</span> that to <a href="" id="murder" class="annotBtn">murder Uriah and adulterate his Wife</a>, had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> no <span class="varspell" title="sin">sinn</span> against his <span class="varspell" title="Neighbor">Neighbour</span>, when as that Law of <span class="mi">Moses </span>  was to the King <span class="varspell" title="expressly">expresly</span>, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> </span>  17. not to think so highly of himself <a href="" id="brethren" class="annotBtn">above his Brethren</a>.  David <span class="varspell" title="therefor">therfore</span> by those words could mean no other, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> either that the depth of his guiltiness was known to God <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>, or to so few as had not the will or power to question him, or that the sin against God was greater beyond compare <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> against <span class="mi">Uriah. </span>  What ever his meaning were, any wise man will see that the pathetical words of a <span class="varspell" title="Psalm">Psalme</span> can be no <span class="varspell" title="certain">certaine</span> decision to a <span class="varspell" title="point">poynt</span> that <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> abundantly more certain rules to <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> by. How much more rationally spake the Heathen King <span class="mi">Demophoon</span> in a Tragedy of <a href="" id="euripides" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Euripides</span></a> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> these Interpreters would put upon King <span class="mi">David, I rule not my people by Tyranny, as if they were Barbarians, but am my self liable, if I <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> unjustly, to suffer justly. </span>  Not unlike was the speech of <a href="" id="trajan" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Trajan </span></a> the worthy Emperor, to one whom he made General of his <span class="varspell" title="Praetorian">Pr&aelig;torian</span> Forces. Take this drawn sword, saith he, to use for me, if I <span class="varspell" title="reign">reigne</span> well, if not, to use against me. Thus <span class="mi">Dion</span>   relates. And not <span class="mi">Trajan</span>  <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>, but <a href="" id="theodosius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Theodosius  </span></a> the <span class="varspell" title="younger">yonger</span>, a Christian Emperor and one of the best, <span class="varspell" title="caused">causd</span> it to be enacted as a rule <span class="varspell" title="undeniable">undenyable</span> and fit to be <span class="varspell" title="acknowledged">acknowledg'd</span> by all Kings and Emperors, that a Prince is bound to the Laws; that on the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of Law the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of a Prince depends, and to the Laws ought <span class="varspell" title="submit">submitt</span>. Which Edict of his remains yet  in the <a href="" id="code" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Code</span> of <span class="mi">Justinian</span></a><span class="mi" lang="la">  <abbr title="liber">l.</abbr> </span>  I. <span class="mi"><abbr title="titula">tit.</abbr></span> 24. as a sacred constitution to all the succeeding Emperors. How then can any King in Europe maintain and write himself accountable to none but God, when Emperors in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own imperial Statutes have <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> and decreed themselves accountable to Law. And indeed where such account is not <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, he that bids a man <span class="varspell" title="reign">reigne</span> over him above Law, may bid as well a savage Beast.
	</p>
	  <p>It follows lastly, that since the King or Magistrate holds his <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> of the people, both <span class="varspell" title="originally">originaly</span> and naturally for their good in the first place, and not his own, then may the people as <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> as they shall judge it for the best, either choose him or reject him, <span class="varspell" title="retain">retaine</span> him or depose him though no Tyrant, <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> by the liberty and right of free born Men, to be <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> as seems to them best. This, though it cannot but stand with plain reason, shall be made good also by <a href="" id="scripture" class="annotBtn">Scripture</a>. <span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> </span> 17.14. <span class="mi">When thou art come into the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt say I will set a King over <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>, like as all the Nations about <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>. </span>  These words <span class="varspell" title="confirm">confirme</span> us that the right of choosing, yea of changing <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own <span class="varspell" title="Government">Goverment</span> is by the grant of God himself in the People. And <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> when they <span class="varspell" title="desired">desir'd</span> a King, though then under another form of <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span>, and though <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> changing <span class="varspell" title="displeased">displeas'd</span> him, yet he that was himself <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> King, and rejected by them, would not be a <span class="varspell" title="hinderance">hindrance</span> to what they intended, <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span>, but that they might <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> therein as they saw good, 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr></span>  8. <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> he reserv'd to himself the nomination of who should <span class="varspell" title="reign">reigne</span> over them. Neither did that exempt the King, as if he were to God <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> accountable, though by his especial command anointed. <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> <span class="mi">David first made a <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> with the Elders of Israel, and so was by them anointed King,</span> <a href="" id="second_samuel" class="annotBtn">2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr></span> 5.3</a>. <a href="" id="first_chronicles" class="annotBtn">1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr></span>   11</a>. And <span class="mi">Jehoiada </span>  the Priest making <span class="mi">Jehoash</span> King, made a <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Cov'nant</span> between him and the People, <a href="" id="second_kings" class="annotBtn">2 <span class="mi">Kings </span>  11.17</a>. <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> when <a href="" id="roboam" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Roboam </span></a> at his <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> to the Crown, rejected those conditions which the Israelites brought him, <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> what they answer him, <span class="mi">What portion have we in David, or Inheritance in the son of Jesse? See to Thine own House David.</span> And for the like conditions not <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</span>, all Israel before that time <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> <span class="mi">Samuel</span>;  not for his own default but for <a href="" id="samuelsons" class="annotBtn">the <span class="varspell" title="misgovernment">misgoverment</span> of his Sons</a>. But <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> will say to both these examples, it was evilly <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>. I answer, that not the latter, because it was expressly <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> them in the Law to set up a King if they <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span>; and God himself <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> with them in the work; though in <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> sort it was at that time displeasing to him, in respect of old <span class="mi">Samuel</span> who had <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> them uprightly. As <span class="mi">Livy </span>  praises the Romans who took occasion from <a href="" id="tarquinius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Tarquinius</span></a>  a wicked Prince to <span class="varspell" title="gain">gaine</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>, which to have extorted saith <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>, from <a href="" id="numa" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Numa</span></a>, or any of the good Kings before, had not <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> seasonable. Nor was it in the former example <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> unlawfully; for when <span class="mi">Roboam</span> had <span class="varspell" title="prepared">prepar'd</span> a huge Army to reduce the Israelites, he was <span class="varspell" title="forbidden">forbidd'n</span> by the Prophet, <a href="" id="prophet" class="annotBtn">I <span class="mi">Kings  </span> 12.24.</a> <span class="mi">Thus saith the Lord <span class="varspell" title="ye">yee</span> shall not <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> up, nor fight against your brethren, for this thing is from me.</span> He calls them <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Brethren, not Rebels, and <span class="varspell" title="forbids">forbidds</span> to be proceeded against them, owning the thing himself, not by single providence, but by approbation, and that not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> of the act, as in the former example, but of the fit season also; he had not otherwise <span class="varspell" title="forbid">forbidd</span> to molest them. And those grave and wise Counselors whom <span class="mi">Rehoboam </span>  first <span class="varspell" title="advised">advis'd</span> with, spake no such thing, as our old gray headed Flatterers now are wont, stand upon your <span class="varspell" title="birthright">birth-right</span>, scorn to capitulate, you hold of God, and not of them; for they knew no such matter, unless conditionally, but gave him politic counsel, as in a civil transaction. <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> Kingdom and Magistracy, whether supreme or <span class="varspell" title="subordinate">subordinat</span>, is without difference, <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> <span class="mi">a human ordinance</span>, <a href="" id="first_peter" class="annotBtn">I <span class="mi"><abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> </span> 2.13. <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></a> which we are there taught is the will of God <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> should alike <span class="varspell" title="submit">submitt</span> to, so <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> as for the punishment of evil doers, and the encouragement of them that <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> well.  <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Submit">Submitt</span> </span>  saith he, <span class="mi">as free men. </span>  But to any civil power unaccountable, unquestionable, and not to be resisted, no not in wickedness, and violent actions, how can we <span class="varspell" title="submit">submitt</span> as free men? <span class="mi">There is no power but of God,</span> saith <span class="mi">Paul, </span><a href="" id="power" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> </span> 13.</a> as much as to say, God put it into <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> heart to find out that way at first for common peace and preservation, approving the exercise <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span>; <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> it contradicts <span class="mi">Peter</span> who calls the same <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> an Ordinance of man. It must be also understood of <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> and just power, <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> we read of great power in the <span class="varspell" title="affairs">affaires</span> and Kingdoms of the World permitted to the Devil: for saith he to Christ, <a href="" id="luke4" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Luke  </span> 4.6.</a> <span class="mi">All this power will I give thee and the glory of them, for it is <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliver'd</span> to me, <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> to whomsoever I will, I give it: </span> neither did he <span class="varspell" title="lie">ly</span>, or Christ gainsay what he <span class="varspell" title="affirmed">affirm'd</span>; for in the thirteenth of the <a href="" id="revelation13" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Revelation </span></a>  <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> read how the Dragon gave to the beast <span class="mi">his power, his <span class="varspell" title="seat">seate</span>, and great <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>:</span> which beast so <span class="varspell" title="authorized">autoriz'd</span> most expound to be the tyrannical powers and Kingdoms of the earth. <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> Saint <span class="mi">Paul</span>  in the <a href="" id="forecited" class="annotBtn">forecited Chapter</a> tells us that such Magistrates he <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span>, as are, not a terror to the good but to the evil; such as <span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span> not the sword in <span class="varspell" title="vain">vaine</span>, but to punish offenders, and to encourage the good. If such <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> be <span class="varspell" title="mentioned">mentiond</span> here as powers to be <span class="varspell" title="obeyed">obeyd</span>, and our submission to them <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span>, then doubtless those powers that <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> the contrary, are no powers <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span> of God, and by consequence no obligation laid upon us to obey or not to resist them. And it may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> well <span class="varspell" title="observed">observd</span> that both these Apostles, whenever they give this precept, express it in <span class="varspell" title="terms">termes</span> not <span class="mi">concrete </span>  but <span class="mi">abstract</span>, as Logicians are wont to <span class="varspell" title="speak">speake</span>, that is, they mention the ordinance, the power, the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> before the persons that execute it; and what that power is, <span class="varspell" title="lest">least</span> we should be <span class="varspell" title="deceived">deceav'd</span>, they describe exactly. So that if the power be not such, or the person execute not such power, neither the one nor the other is of God, but of the Devil, and by consequence to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> resisted. From this exposition <a href="" id="chrysostome" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Chrysostome </span></a> also on the same place dissents not; explaining that these words were not <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> in behalf of a tyrant. And this is <span class="varspell" title="verified">verify'd</span> by <span class="mi">David</span>, himself a King, and likeliest to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> Author of the <a href="" id="psalm94" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Psalm  </span> 94.20</a>. which saith <span class="mi">Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee? </span>  And it were worth the knowing, since Kings in these <span class="varspell" title="days">dayes</span>, and that by Scripture, boast the justness of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> title, by holding it immediately of God, yet cannot show the time when God ever set on the throne them or <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> forefathers, but <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> when the people chose them, why by the same reason, since God ascribes as <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> to himself the casting down of Princes from the throne, it should not be thought as lawful, and as much from God, when none are seen to do it but the people, and that for just causes. For if it needs must be a sin in them to depose, it may as likely be a sin to have elected. And contrary if the <span class="varspell" title="people's">peoples</span> act in election be pleaded by a King, as the act of God, and the most just title to enthrone him, why may not the <span class="varspell" title="people's">peoples</span> act of rejection, <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> as well pleaded by the people as the act of God, and the most just reason to depose him? So that we see the title and just right of <span class="varspell" title="reigning">raigning</span> or deposing, in reference to God, is found in Scripture to be all one; visible <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> in the people, and depending <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> upon justice and demerit. Thus <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> considerd briefly the power of Kings and Magistrates; how it was and is originally the <span class="varspell" title="people's">peoples</span>, and by them <span class="varspell" title="conferred">conferr'd</span> in trust <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="employed">imployd</span> to the common peace and benefit; with liberty <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> and right remaining in them to reassume it to themselves, if by Kings or Magistrates it be <span class="varspell" title="abused">abus'd</span>; or to dispose of it by any alteration, as they shall judge most conducing to the public good.

	<p><span class="varspell" title="We">Wee</span> may from hence with more ease, and force of argument <span class="varspell" title="determine">determin</span> what a Tyrant is, and what the people may <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> against him. A Tyrant whether by wrong or by right <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> to the Crown, is he who regarding neither Law nor the common good, reigns <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> for himself and his faction: Thus <a href="" id="basil" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Basil </span></a> among others defines him. And because his power is great, his will boundless and exorbitant, the fulfilling whereof is for the most part accompanied with innumerable wrongs and oppressions of the people, murders <span class="varspell" title="massacres">massachers</span>, rapes, adulteries, desolation, and subversion of <span class="varspell" title="Cities">Citties</span> and whole Provinces, look how great a good and happiness a just King is, so great a <span class="varspell" title="mischief">mischeife</span> is a Tyrant; as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> the public father of his <span class="varspell" title="Country">Countrie</span>, so this the common <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span>. Against whom what the people lawfully may <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, as against a common pest, and destroyer of <span class="varspell" title="mankind">mankinde</span>, I suppose no man of <span class="varspell" title="clear">cleare</span> judgement need <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> to be guided then by the very principles of nature in him.  But because it is the vulgar folly of men to desert <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own reason, and shutting <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> eyes to think they see best with other <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span>, I shall <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> by such examples as ought to have most <span class="varspell" title="weight">waight</span> with us, what <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> in this case heretofore. The <span class="mi">Greeks</span> and <span class="mi">Romans</span>, as <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> prime Authors witness, held it not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>, but a glorious and Heroic deed, rewarded publicly with Statues and Garlands, to kill an infamous Tyrant at any time without <span class="varspell" title="trial">tryal</span>: and but reason, that he who trod down all Law, should not be <span class="varspell" title="vouchsafed">voutsaf'd</span> the benefit of Law. Insomuch that <span class="mi">Seneca  </span> the Tragedian brings in <a href="" id="hercules" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Hercules </span></a> the grand suppressor of Tyrants, thus speaking,</p>

	 <p>But of these I name no more, lest it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> objected they were Heathen; and come to produce another sort of men that had the knowledge of true Religion. Among the Jews this custom of tyrant-killing was not unusual. First <a href="" id="ehud" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ehud</span></a>, a man whom God had <span class="varspell" title="raised">raysd</span> to deliver Israel from <span class="mi">Eglon </span>  King of <span class="mi">Moab</span>, who had <span class="varspell" title="conquered">conquerd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="ruled">rul'd</span> over them <span class="varspell" title="eighteen">eighteene</span> years, being sent to him as an Ambassador with a present, slew him in his own house. But <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> was a <span class="varspell" title="foreign">forren</span> Prince, an <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span>, and <span class="mi">Ehud</span> besides had special warrant from God. To the first I answer, it imports not whether <span class="varspell" title="foreign">forren</span> or native: For no Prince so native but professes to hold by Law; which when he himself overturns, breaking all the <span class="varspell" title="Covenants">Covnants</span> and Oaths that gave him title to his dignity, and were the bond and alliance between him and his people, what differs he from an outlandish King, or from an <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span>? For look how much right the King of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Spain">Spaine</span></span>   <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> to govern us at all, so much right <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> the King of <span class="mi">England </span> to govern us tyrannically. If he, though not bound to us by any League, <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> from <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Spain">Spaine</span></span> in person to subdue us or to destroy us, might lawfully by the people of <span class="mi">England </span> either <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="slain">slaine</span> in fight, or put to death in captivity, what <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> a native King to plead, bound by so many <span class="varspell" title="Covenants">Covnants</span>, benefits and <span class="varspell" title="honors">honours</span> to the welfare of his people, why he through the contempt of all Laws and <span class="varspell" title="Parliaments">Parlaments</span>, the <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> tie of our obedience to him, for his own <span class="varspell" title="will's">wills</span> sake, and a boasted <a href="" id="prerogative" class="annotBtn">prerogative</a> unaccountable, after <span class="varspell" title="seven">sev'n</span> years warring and destroying of his best Subjects, <span class="varspell" title="overcome">overcom</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="yielded">yeilded</span> prisoner, should think to <span class="varspell" title="escape">scape</span> unquestionable, as a thing divine, in respect of whom so many thousand Christians <span class="varspell" title="destroyed">destroy'd</span>, should lie unaccounted for, polluting with their <span class="varspell" title="slaughtered">slaughterd</span> carcasses all the Land over, and crying for vengeance against the living that should have righted them. Who knows not that there is a mutual bond of amity and <span class="varspell" title="brotherhood">brother-hood </span>between man and man over all the World, neither is it the English Sea that can sever us from that duty and relation: a straiter bond yet there is between fellow-subjects, <span class="varspell" title="neighbors">neighbours</span>, and friends; But when any of these <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> one to another so as hostility could <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> no worse, what doth the Law decree less against them, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="open">op'n</span> enemies and invaders? or if the Law be not present, or too <span class="varspell" title="weak">weake</span>, what doth it warrant us to less <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> single defence, or civil <span class="varspell" title="war">warr</span>? and from that time forward the Law of civil defensive <span class="varspell" title="war">warr</span> differs nothing from the Law of <span class="varspell" title="foreign">forren</span> hostility. Nor is it distance of place that makes <span class="varspell" title="enmity">enmitie</span>, but enmity that makes distance. He <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> that keeps peace with me, <span class="varspell" title="near">neer</span> or remote, of whatsoever Nation, is to <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> as <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> as all civil and human offices an Englishman and a <span class="varspell" title="neighbor">neighbour</span>: but if an Englishman forgetting all Laws, human, civil and religious, offend against life and liberty, to him offended and to the Law in his behalf, though born in the same womb, he is no better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a Turk, a <span class="varspell" title="Saracen">Sarasin</span>, a Heathen. This is Gospel, and this was ever Law among equals; how much rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in force against any King whatever, who in respect of the people is confessd inferior and not equal: to distinguish <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> of a Tyrant by outlandish, or domestic is a weak evasion. To the second that he was an <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span>, I answer, what Tyrant is not? yet <span class="mi">Eglon</span> by the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span> had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="acknowledged">acknowledgd</span> as <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="Sovereign">Sovran</span>; they had <span class="varspell" title="served">serv'd</span> him eighteen <span class="varspell" title="years">yeares</span>, as long almost as we our <span class="mi">William </span> the <a href="" id="conqueror" class="annotBtn">Conqueror</a>, in all which time he could not be so unwise a Statesman but to have <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> of them Oaths of Fealty and <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span>, by which they made themselves his proper Subjects, as <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> homage and present sent by <span class="mi">Ehud</span>   <span class="varspell" title="testified">testify'd</span>. To the third, that he had special warrant to kill <span class="mi">Eglon </span> in that manner, it cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> granted, because not <span class="varspell" title="expressed">expressd</span>; tis plain that he was <span class="varspell" title="raised">raysd</span> by God to be a Deliverer, and went on just principles, such as were then and ever held allowable, to <span class="varspell" title="deal">deale</span> so by a Tyrant that could no otherwise be dealt with. Neither did <span class="mi">Samuel </span>  though a <span class="varspell" title="Prophet">Profet</span>, with his own hand abstain from <a href="" id="agag" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Agag</span></a>; a <span class="varspell" title="foreign">forren</span> <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span> no doubt; but mark the reason. <a href="" id="childless" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">As thy Sword <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> made women childless</span></a>; a cause that by the sentence of Law it self nullifies all relations. And as the Law is between Brother and Brother, Father and Son, <span class="varspell" title="Master">Maister</span> and Servant, <span class="varspell" title="wherefore">wherfore</span> not between King or rather Tyrant and People? And whereas <a href="" id="jehu" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Jehu</span></a> had special command to slay <span class="mi">Jehoram </span> a successive and <span class="varspell" title="hereditary">hereditarie</span> Tyrant, it seems not the less imitable for that; for where a thing grounded so much on natural reason <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> the addition of a command from God, what does it but establish the lawfulness of such an act. Nor is it likely that God who had so many <span class="varspell" title="ways">wayes</span> of punishing the house of <span class="mi">Ahab </span> would have sent a subject against his Prince, if the fact in it self, as <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> to a Tyrant, had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> of bad example. And if <span class="mi">David </span>  <span class="varspell" title="refused">refus'd</span> to lift his hand against the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> <a href="" id="anointed" class="annotBtn">anointed</a>, the matter between them was not tyranny, but <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> enmity, and <span class="mi">David </span>  as a <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> person had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> his own revenger, not so much the <span class="varspell" title="people's">peoples</span>. But when any tyrant at this day can <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> to be the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> anointed, the <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="mentioned">mention'd</span> reason why <span class="mi">David </span>  withheld his hand, he may then but not till then presume on the same privilege.
	</p>  <p><span class="varspell" title="We">Wee</span> may pass <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> hence to Christian times. And first our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> himself, how much he <span class="varspell" title="favored">favourd</span> Tyrants, and how much intended they should be found or <span class="varspell" title="honored">honourd</span> among Christians, declares his mind not obscurely; accounting <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> absolute <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> no better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="" id="gentilism" class="annotBtn">Gentilism</a>, yea though they <span class="varspell" title="flourished">flourish'd</span> it over with the splendid name of <a href="" id="benefactors" class="annotBtn">Benefactors</a>; charging those that would be his Disciples to usurp no such dominion; but that they who were to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> of most <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> among them, should esteem themselves Ministers and Servants to the public. <a href="" id="matthew20" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> </span> 20.25.</a> <span class="mi">The Princes of the Gentiles excercise Lordship over them</span>, and <a href="" id="mark10" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Mark </span>  10.42.</a> <span class="mi">They that seem to rule</span>, saith he, either slighting or accounting them no lawful rulers, <span class="mi">but <span class="varspell" title="ye">yee</span> shall not be so, but the greatest among you shall be your Servant. </span> And although <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> himself were the meekest, and came on earth to be so, yet to a Tyrant we hear him not <span class="varspell" title="vouchsafe">voutsafe</span> an humble word: but <span class="mi">Tell that Fox, </span><a href="" id="tell" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Luke">Luc.</abbr> </span> 13.</a> So <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> we ought to be from thinking that Christ and his Gospel should be made a Sanctuary for Tyrants from justice, to whom his Law before never gave such protection. And <span class="varspell" title="wherefore">wherfore</span> did his Mother <a href="" id="virgin" class="annotBtn">the Virgin <span class="mi">Mary </span></a> give such praise to God in her <span class="varspell" title="prophetic">profetic</span> song, that he had now by the <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> of Christ <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Cut">Cutt</span> down <a href="" id="dynasta" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Dynasties">Dynasta's</span></a>  or proud Monarchs from the throne</span>, if the Church, when God manifests his power in them to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> so, should rather choose all <span class="varspell" title="misery">miserie</span> and vassalage to serve them, and let them <span class="varspell" title="still">stil</span> sit on <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> potent seats to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="adored">ador'd</span> for doing mischief. Surely it is not for nothing that tyrants by a kind of natural instinct both hate and <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> none more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the true Church and Saints of God, as the most dangerous enemies and subverters of Monarchy, though indeed of tyranny; <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> not this <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> the perpetual cry of Courtiers, and Court <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>? whereof no likelier cause can be <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span>, but that they well <span class="varspell" title="discerned">discern'd</span> the mind and principles of most devout and zealous men, and indeed the very discipline of Church, tending to the dissolution of all tyranny. No marvel then if since the faith of Christ <span class="varspell" title="received">receav'd</span>, in purer or impurer times, to depose a King and put him to death for Tyranny, <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> accounted so just and requisite, that <span class="varspell" title="neighbor">neighbour</span> Kings have both upheld and <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> part with subjects in the action. And <a href="" id="ludovicus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ludovicus Pius</span></a>, himself an Emperor, and Son of <span class="mi">Charles </span> the great, being made Judge, <a href="" id="du" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Du Haillan </span></a> is my author, between <span class="mi">Milegast </span>  King of the <span class="mi">Vultzes </span>  and his Subjects who had <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> him, gave his verdit for the Subjects, and for him whom they had <span class="varspell" title="chosen">chos'n</span> in his room. Note here that the right of electing whom they please is by the impartial testimony of an Emperor in the people. For, said he, <span class="mi">A just Prince ought to be <span class="varspell" title="preferred">prefer'd</span> before an unjust, and the end of <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span> before the prerogative.</span> And <a href="" id="constantinus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Constantinus Leo</span></a>, another Emperor, in the <span class="mi">Byzantine </span>  Laws saith, <span class="mi">that the end of a King is for the general good, which he not performing is but the <span class="varspell" title="counterfeit">counterfet</span> of a King.</span> And to prove that <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> of our own Monarchs have <span class="varspell" title="acknowledged">acknowledg'd</span> that <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> high office exempted them not from punishment, they had the <a href="" id="edward" class="annotBtn">Sword of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Edward </span></a> born before them by an officer who was <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> Earle of the Palace, <span class="varspell" title="even">eev'n</span> at the times of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> highest pomp and solemnities, to mind them, saith <span class="mi">Matthew Paris</span>, the best of our Historians, that if they <span class="varspell" title="erred">errd</span>, the Sword had power to <span class="varspell" title="restrain">restraine</span> them.  And what restraint the Sword comes to at length, having both edge and point, if any <span class="mi">Sceptic </span>  will  doubt, let him feel. It is also <span class="varspell" title="affirmed">affirm'd</span> from diligent search made in our <a href="" id="ancient" class="annotBtn">ancient books of Law</a>, that the Peers and Barons of England had a legal right to judge the King: which was the cause most likely, for it could be no slight cause, that they were <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> his Peers, or equals. This however may stand immovable, so long as man <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> to <span class="varspell" title="deal">deale</span> with no better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> man; that if our Law judge all men to the lowest by <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Peers, it should in all equity ascend also, and judge the highest. And so much I find both in our own and <span class="varspell" title="foreign">forren</span> <span class="varspell" title="Story">Storie</span>, that Dukes, Earles, and Marqueses were at first not hereditary, not empty and vain titles, but names of trust and office, and with the office ceasing, as induces me to be of opinion, that every worthy man in <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, for the word Baron imports no more, might for the public good be thought a fit Peer and judge of the King; without regard had to petty <a href="" id="caveats" class="annotBtn">caveats</a>, and circumstances, the chief impediment in high <span class="varspell" title="affairs">affaires</span>, and ever stood upon most by <a href="" id="circumstantial" class="annotBtn">circumstantial</a> men. Whence doubtless our Ancestors who were not ignorant with what rights either Nature or ancient Constitution had <span class="varspell" title="endowed">endowd</span> them, when Oaths both at Coronation, and <span class="varspell" title="renewed">renewd</span> in <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> would not serve, thought it no way illegal to depose and put to death <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> tyrannous Kings. Insomuch that the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> drew up a charge against <a href="" id="second" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Richard the second</span></a>, and the Commons requested to have judgement <span class="varspell" title="decreed">decree'd</span> against him, that the <span class="varspell" title="realm">realme</span> might not <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="endangered">endangerd</span>.

But far before these days, <a href="" id="gildas" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Gildas </span></a> the most ancient of all our Historians, speaking of those times wherein the Roman Empire decaying quitted and <span class="varspell" title="relinquished">relinquishd</span> what right they had by Conquest to this <span class="varspell" title="Island">Iland</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="resigned">resign'd</span> it all into the <span class="varspell" title="people's">peoples</span> hands, testifies that the people thus re-invested with <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own original right, about the year 446, both elected them Kings, whom they thought best (the first Christian <span class="varspell" title="British">Brittish</span> Kings that ever <span class="varspell" title="reigned">raign'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> since the Romans) and by the same right, when they apprehended cause, usually <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> and put them to death. This is the most fundamental and ancient tenure that any King of <span class="mi">England </span>  can produce or pretend to; in comparison of which, all other titles and pleas are but of yesterday. If any object that <span class="mi">Gildas </span>  condemns the <span class="varspell" title="Britons">Britans</span> for so doing, the answer is as ready; that he condemns them no more for so doing, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> did before for choosing such, for saith he, <span class="mi">They anointed them Kings, not of God, but such as were more bloody <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the rest. </span>  Next <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> condemns them not at all for deposing or putting them to death, but for doing it over hastily, without <span class="varspell" title="trial">tryal</span> or well examining the cause, and for electing others <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span> in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> room. Thus we have <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> both domestic and most ancient examples that the people of Britain have <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> and put to death <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Kings in those primitive Christian times. And to couple reason with example, if the Church in all ages, Primitive, Romish, or Protestant, held it ever no less <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> duty <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the power of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <a href="" id="keyes" class="annotBtn">Keyes</a>, though without express warrant of Scripture, to bring indifferently both King and Peasant under the utmost rigor of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Canons and Censures Ecclesiastical, <span class="varspell" title="even">eev'n</span> to the smiting him with a final excommunion, if he persist impenitent, what hinders but that the temporal Law both may and ought, though without a special Text or precedent, extend with like indifference the civil Sword, to the cutting off without exemption him that capitally offends. Seeing that justice and Religion are from the same God, and works of justice ofttimes more acceptable. Yet because that some lately, with the tongues and arguments of Malignant backsliders, have <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> that the proceedings now in <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> against the King, are without precedent from any Protestant State or Kingdom, the examples which follow shall be all Protestant and chiefly Presbyterian.

If now then we heare them in another strain <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> heretofore in the purest times of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Church, we may be confident it is the voice of Faction speaking in them, not of truth and Reformation.

	</p>  
	<p>But what need these examples to Presbyterians, I mean to those who now of late would seem so much to <span class="varspell" title="abhor">abhorr</span> deposing, when as they to all Christendom have <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> the latest and the liveliest example of doing it themselves. I question not the lawfulness of raising <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> against a Tyrant in defence of Religion, or civil <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>; for no Protestant Church from the first <a href="" id="Waldenses" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Waldenses </span></a> of <span class="mi">Lyons</span>, and <span class="mi">Languedoc</span>  to this day but have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> it <a href="" id="round" class="annotBtn">round</a>, and <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintain'd</span> it lawful. But this I doubt not to <span class="varspell" title="affirm">affirme</span>, that the Presbyterians, who now so much condemn deposing, were the men themselves that <span class="varspell" title="deposed">deposd</span> the King, and cannot with all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> shifting and relapsing, wash off the guiltiness from <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own hands. For they themselves, by these <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> late doings have made it guiltiness, and <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own warrantable actions into Rebellion.

</p>  <p>There is nothing that so actually makes a King of <span class="mi">England</span>, as rightful possession and Supremacy <span class="mi">in all causes both civil and Ecclesiastical: </span>  and nothing that so actually makes a Subject of <span class="mi">England</span>, as those <a href="" id="two" class="annotBtn">two Oaths of <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span> and Supremacy</a> <span class="varspell" title="observed">observd</span> <span class="mi">without equivocating, or any mental reservation. </span>  Out of doubt then when the King shall command things already constituted in Church, or State, obedience is the true essence of a subject, either to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, if it be lawful, or if he hold the thing unlawful, to <span class="varspell" title="submit">submitt</span> to that <span class="varspell" title="penalty">penaltie</span> which the Law imposes, so long as he intends to <span class="varspell" title="remain">remaine</span> a Subject. <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> when the people or any part of them shall rise against the King and his <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> executing the Law in any thing <span class="varspell" title="established">establish'd</span> civil or Ecclesiastical, I <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not say it is rebellion, if the thing commanded though <span class="varspell" title="established">establish'd</span> be unlawful, and that they sought first all due means of redress (and no man is <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> bound to Law) but I say it is an absolute renouncing both of Supremacy and <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span>, which in one word is an actual and total deposing of the King, and the setting up of another supreme <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> over them. And whether the Presbyterians have not <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> all this and much more, they will not put <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>, I suppose, to <span class="varspell" title="reckon">reck'n</span> up a <a href="" id="seven" class="annotBtn">seven <span class="varspell" title="years'">years</span></a> story fresh in the memory of all men. Have they not utterly broke the Oath of <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span>, rejecting the <span class="varspell" title="King's">Kings</span> command and <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> sent them from any part of the Kingdom whether in things lawful or unlawful? Have they not <span class="varspell" title="abjured">abjur'd</span> the Oath of Supremacy by setting up the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> without the King, supreme to all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> obedience, and though <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Vow and <a href="" id="covnant" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span></a> bound them in general to the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, yet <a href="" id="somtimes" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="sometimes">somtimes</span> adhering to the lesser part</a> of Lords and Commons that <span class="varspell" title="remained">remaind</span> faithful, as they <span class="varspell" title="term">terme</span> it, and <span class="varspell" title="even">eev'n</span> of them, one while to the Commons without the Lords, another while to the Lords without the Commons? Have they not still <span class="varspell" title="declared">declar'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> meaning, whatever <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Oath were, to hold them <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> for supreme whom they found at any time most <span class="varspell" title="yielding">yeilding</span> to what they petition'd? Both these Oaths which were the straitest bond of an English subject in reference to the King, being thus broke <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> made <span class="varspell" title="void">voide</span>, it follows <span class="varspell" title="undeniably">undenyably</span> that the King from that time was by them in fact absolutely <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span>, and they no longer in reality to be thought his subjects, notwithstanding <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <a href="" id="fine" class="annotBtn">fine clause</a> in the <a href="" id="covnant" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span></a> to preserve his person, Crown, and dignity, set there by <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> dodging Casuist with more craft <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> sincerity to mitigate the matter in case of ill sucess and not <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> I suppose by any honest man, but as a condition <span class="varspell" title="subordinate">subordinat</span> to every the least particle that might more <span class="varspell" title="concern">concerne</span> Religion, liberty, or the public peace. To prove it yet more plainly that they are the men who have <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> the King, I thus argue. We know that King and Subject are <a href="" id="relatives" class="annotBtn">relatives</a>, and relatives have no longer being <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in the relation; the relation between King and Subject can be no other <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> regal <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> and subjection. Hence I <span class="varspell" title="infer">inferr</span> past their defending, that if the Subject who is one relative, take away the relation, of force he takes away also the other relative; but the Presbyterians who were one relative, that is to say Subjects, have for this <span class="varspell" title="seven">sev'n</span> years <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> away the relation, that is to say the <span class="varspell" title="King's">Kings</span> <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> subjection to it, <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> the Presbyterians for these <span class="varspell" title="seven">sev'n</span> years have <span class="varspell" title="removed">remov'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="extinguished">extinguishd</span> the other relative, that is to say the King, or to speak more in brief have <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> him; not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> by depriving him the execution of his <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span>, but by conferring it upon others. If then <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Oaths of subjection <span class="varspell" title="broken">brok'n</span>, new Supremacy <span class="varspell" title="obeyed">obey'd</span>, new Oaths and <span class="varspell" title="Covenants">Covnants</span> <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span>, notwithstanding frivolous evasions, have in <span class="varspell" title="plain">plaine</span> <span class="varspell" title="terms">termes</span> <span class="varspell" title="unkinged">unking'd</span> the King, much more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="seven">sev'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="years'">years</span> <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> not <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> him <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>, but <span class="varspell" title="outlawed">outlaw'd</span> him, and <span class="varspell" title="defied">defi'd</span> him as an alien, a <span class="varspell" title="rebel">rebell</span> to Law, and <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span> to the State. It must needs be clear to any man not <span class="varspell" title="averse">avers</span> from reason, that <span class="varspell" title="hostility">hostilitie</span> and subjection are two direct and positive contraries; and can no more in one subject stand together in respect of the same King, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> one person at the same time can be in two remote places. Against whom <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> the Subject is in act of hostility we may be confident that to him he is in no subjection: and in whom hostility takes place of subjection, for they can by no <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> consist together, to him the King can be not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> no King, but an <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span>. So that from hence we shall not need dispute whether they have <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> him, or what they have defaulted towards him as no King, but <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> manifestly how much they have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> toward the killing him. Have they not levied all these <span class="varspell" title="Wars">Warrs</span> against him whether offensive or defensive (for defence in <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> equally offends, and most prudently before hand) and <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> Commission to slay where they knew his person could not be exempt from danger? And if chance or flight had not <span class="varspell" title="saved">sav'd</span> him, how <span class="varspell" title="often">oft'n</span> had they <span class="varspell" title="killed">killd</span> him, directing <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Artillery without blame or prohibition to the very place where they saw him stand? Have they not <span class="varspell" title="Sequestered">Sequester'd</span> him, <span class="varspell" title="judg'd">judg'd</span> or <span class="varspell" title="unjudged">unjudgd</span>, and converted his <span class="varspell" title="revenue">revenew</span> to other uses, detaining from him as a grand Delinquent, all <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> of <span class="varspell" title="livelihood">livelyhood</span>, so that for them long since he might have <span class="varspell" title="perished">perisht</span>, or have <span class="varspell" title="starved">starv'd</span>? Have they not hunted and <span class="varspell" title="pursued">pursu'd</span> him round about the Kingdom with sword and fire? Have they not formerly <a href="" id="denyd" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> to Treat with him</a>, and <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> now recanting Ministers <span class="varspell" title="preached">preach'd</span> against him, as a reprobate incurable, an enemy to God  and his Church <span class="varspell" title="marked">markt</span> for destruction, and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> not to be treated with? Have they not <span class="varspell" title="beseiged">beseig'd</span> him, <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> power <span class="varspell" title="forbid">forbidd</span> him Water and Fire, save what they shot against him to the hazard of his life? Yet while they thus assaulted and <span class="varspell" title="endangered">endangerd</span> it with hostile deeds, they swore in words to defend it with his Crown and dignity; not in order, as it seems now, to a firm and lasting peace, or to his repentance after all this blood; but simply, without regard, without remorse, or any comparable value of all the miseries and calamities <span class="varspell" title="suffered">sufferd</span> by the <span class="varspell" title="poor">poore</span> people, or to suffer hereafter through his obstinacy or impenitence. No understanding man can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> ignorant that <span class="varspell" title="Covenants">Covnants</span> are ever made according to the present state of persons and of things; and have ever the more general laws of nature and of reason included in them, though not <span class="varspell" title="expressed">express'd</span>. If I make a voluntary <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> as with a man, to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> him good, and he prove afterward a monster to me, I should <span class="varspell" title="conceive">conceave</span> a disobligement. If I <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span>, not to hurt an <span class="varspell" title="enemy">enemie</span>, in <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> of him <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> forbearance, <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> hope of his amendment, <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> he, after that, shall <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> me <span class="varspell" title="tenfold">tenfould</span> injury and mischief, to what he had <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> when I so <span class="varspell" title="Covenanted">Covnanted</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="still">stil</span> be plotting what may tend to my destruction, I question not but that his after actions release me; nor know I <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> so sacred that withholds me from demanding justice on him. Howbeit, had not <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> distrust in a good cause,  and the fast and <span class="varspell" title="loose">loos</span> of our prevaricating Divines <span class="varspell" title="overswayed">oversway'd</span>, it had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> doubtless better not to have inserted in a <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> unnecessary obligations, and words not works of a <a href="" id="supererogating" class="annotBtn">supererogating</a> <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span> to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> enemy; no way advantageous to themselves, had the King <span class="varspell" title="prevailed">prevail'd</span>, as to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> cost many would have felt; but full of snare and distraction to our friends, <span class="varspell" title="useful">usefull</span> <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>, as we now find, to our adversaries, who under such a latitude and shelter of ambiguous interpretation have ever since been plotting and contriving new opportunities to trouble all again. How much better had it <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span>, and more <span class="varspell" title="becoming">becomming</span> an undaunted <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, to have <span class="varspell" title="declared">declar'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="openly">op'nly</span> and boldly whom and what power the people were to hold Supreme; as on the <a href="" id="like" class="annotBtn">like occasion</a> Protestants have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> before, and many conscientious men now in these times have more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> once besought the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, that they might <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> on upon a sure foundation, and not with a <span class="varspell" title="riddling">ridling</span> <a href="" id="covnant" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span></a> in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> mouths, seeming to <span class="varspell" title="swear">sweare</span> counter almost in the same breath <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span> <a href="" id="and" class="annotBtn">and</a> no <span class="varspell" title="Allegiance">Allegeance</span>; which doubtless had drawn off all the minds of sincere men from siding with them, had they not <span class="varspell" title="discerned">discern'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> actions <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> more deposing him <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> words upholding him; which words made now the subject of cavillous interpretations,  stood ever in the <a href="" id="covnant" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span></a>, by judgement of the more discerning sort, an evidence of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span>, not of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> fidelity. What should I return to  speak on, of those attempts for which the King himself <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="often">oft'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="charged">charg'd</span> the Presbyterians of seeking his life, when as in the due estimation of things, they might without a fallacy be <span class="varspell" title="said">sayd</span> to have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> the deed outright. Who knows not that the King is a name of dignity and office, not of person: Who <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> kills a King, must kill him while he is a King. Then they certainly who by deposing him have long since <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> from him the life of a King, his office and his dignity, they in the truest <span class="varspell" title="sense">sence</span> may be said to have <span class="varspell" title="killed">killd</span> the King: nor <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> by <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> deposing and waging <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> against him, which besides the danger to his personal life, <span class="varspell" title="set">sett</span> him in the <span class="varspell" title="farthest">fardest</span> opposite point from any vital function of a King, but by <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> holding him in <a href="" id="prison" class="annotBtn">prison</a>, <span class="varspell" title="vanquished">vanquishd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="yielded">yeilded</span> into <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> absolute and <span class="mi">despotic </span>  power, which brought him to the lowest degradement and incapacity of the regal name. I say not by <a href="" id="whose" class="annotBtn">whose matchless <span class="varspell" title="valor">valour</span></a> next under God, lest the story of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> ingratitude thereupon carry me from the purpose in hand, which is to convince them that they, which I repeat <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span>, were the men who in the truest sense <span class="varspell" title="killed">killd</span> the King, not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> as is <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> before, but by depressing him <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> King <span class="varspell" title="far">farr</span> below the rank of a subject to the condition of a Captive, without intention to restore him, as the <a href="" id="chancellour" class="annotBtn">Chancellour of <span class="mi">Scotland</span></a>   in a speech told him plainly at <span class="mi">Newcastle</span>, unless <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> granted fully 
    all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> demands, which they knew he never meant. Nor did they Treat or think of Treating with him, till <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> hatred to the Army that <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span> them, not <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> love or duty to the King, <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> them secretly with men <span class="varspell" title="sentenced">sentenc'd</span> so <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> for <span class="varspell" title="Reprobates">Reprobats</span> in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own <span class="varspell" title="mouths">mouthes</span>, by whose <span class="varspell" title="subtle">suttle</span> inspiring they grew <span class="varspell" title="mad">madd</span> upon a most tardy and <a href="" id="improper" class="annotBtn">improper Treaty</a>. Whereas if the whole bent of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> actions had not <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> against the King himself, but only against his evil <span class="varspell" title="counselors">counselers</span>, as they <span class="varspell" title="feigned">faind</span>, <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> <span class="varspell" title="published">publishd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="wherefore">wherfore</span> did they not restore him all that while to the true life of a King, his office, Crown, and Dignity, when he was in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> power, <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> they themselves his <span class="varspell" title="nearest">neerest</span> <span class="varspell" title="Counselors">Counselers</span>. The truth <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> is, both that they would not, and that indeed they could not without <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own certain destruction; having <span class="varspell" title="reduced">reduc'd</span> him to such a final pass, as was the very death and burial of all in him that was regal, and from whence never King of <span class="mi">England </span>  yet <span class="varspell" title="revived">reviv'd</span>, but by the new <span class="varspell" title="reenforcement">re-inforcement</span> of his own party, which was a kind of resurrection to him. Thus having quite <span class="varspell" title="extinguished">extinguisht</span> all that could be in him of a King, and from a total privation clad him over, like another specifical thing, with <span class="varspell" title="forms">formes</span> and habitudes destructive to the former, they left in his person, dead as to Law, and all the civil right either of King or Subject, the life <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> of a <span class="varspell" title="Prisoner">Prisner</span>, a Captive and a Malefactor.   Whom the equal and impartial hand of justice finding, was no more to spare <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> another <span class="varspell" title="ordinary">ordnary</span> man; not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> made <a href="" id="obnoxious" class="annotBtn">obnoxious</a> to the doom of Law by a charge more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> once drawn up against him, and his own confession to the first Article at <a href="" id="newport" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Newport</span></a>, but <span class="varspell" title="summoned">summond</span> and <span class="varspell" title="arraigned">arraign'd</span> in the sight of God and his people, <span class="varspell" title="cursed">curst</span> <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> devoted to perdition worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any <a href="" id="ahab" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ahab</span></a>, or <a href="" id="antiochus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Antiochus</span></a>, with exhortation to curse all those in the name of God that made not <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> against him, as bitterly as <a href="" id="meroz" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Meroz</span></a>   was to be <span class="varspell" title="cursed">curs'd</span>, that went not out against a Canaanitish King, almost in all the Sermons, Prayers, and Fulminations that have  <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utterd</span> this <span class="varspell" title="seven">sev'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="years">yeares</span> by those <span class="varspell" title="cloven">clov'n</span> tongues of <span class="varspell" title="falsehood">falshood</span> and dissention; who now, to the stirring up of new discord, <span class="varspell" title="acquit">acquitt</span> him; and against <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own <span class="varspell" title="discipline">disciplin</span>, which they boast to be the throne and scepter of Christ, absolve him, unconfound him, though unconverted, unrepentant, unsensible of all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="precious">pretious</span> Saints and Martyrs whose blood they have so <span class="varspell" title="often">oft</span> laid upon his head: and now <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span> with a new <span class="varspell" title="sovereign">sovran</span> anointment can wash it all off, as if it were as vile, and no more to be <span class="varspell" title="reckoned">reckn'd</span> for, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the blood of so many Dogs in a  time of Pestilence: giving the most opprobrious <span class="varspell" title="lie">lye</span> to all the acted <span class="varspell" title="zeal">zeale</span> that for these many <span class="varspell" title="years">yeares</span> <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="filled">filld</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> bellies, and fed them <span class="varspell" title="fat">fatt</span> upon the foolish people. Ministers of sedition, not of the Gospel, who while they saw it manifestly tend to civil <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> and blood shed, never <span class="varspell" title="ceased">ceasd</span> exasperating the people against him; and now that they see it likely to breed new commotion, cease not to incite others against the people that have <span class="varspell" title="saved">sav'd</span> them from him, as if sedition were <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="aim">aime</span>, whether against him or for him. But God, as we have cause to trust, will put other thoughts into the people, and turn them from giving <span class="varspell" title="ear">eare</span> or heed to these Mercenary noisemakers, of whose fury, and <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> prophecies we have enough experience; and from the murmurs of new discord will incline them to <span class="varspell" title="hearken">heark'n</span> rather with erected minds to the voice of our <a href="" id="supreme" class="annotBtn">Supreme Magistracy</a>, calling us to liberty and the flourishing deeds of a reformed <span class="varspell" title="Commonwealth">Common-wealth</span>; with this hope that as God was heretofore angry with the Jews who rejected him and <a href="" id="hisforme" class="annotBtn">his <span class="varspell" title="form">forme</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Government">Goverment</span></a> to choose a King, so that he will bless us, and be propitious to us who reject a King to make him <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> our leader and supreme <span class="varspell" title="governor">governour</span> in the conformity as <span class="varspell" title="near">neer</span> as may be of his own ancient <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span>; if we have at least but so much worth in us to <span class="varspell" title="entertain">entertaine</span> the sense of our future happiness, and the courage to <span class="varspell" title="receive">receave</span> what  God <span class="varspell" title="vouchsafes">voutsafes</span> us: wherein we have the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> to precede other Nations who are now <span class="varspell" title="laboring">labouring</span> to be our followers. For as to this question in hand what the people by <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> just right may <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> in change of <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span>, or of <span class="varspell" title="governor">governour</span>, we see it <span class="varspell" title="cleared">cleerd</span> sufficiently; besides other ample <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> <span class="varspell" title="even">eev'n</span> from the mouths of Princes themselves. And surely they that shall boast, as we <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>, to be a free Nation, and not have in themselves the power to remove, or to abolish any <span class="varspell" title="governor">governour</span> supreme, or <span class="varspell" title="subordinate">subordinat</span>, with the <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span> it self upon urgent causes, may please <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> fancy with a ridiculous and painted freedom, fit to <span class="varspell" title="cozen">coz'n</span> babies; but are indeed under tyranny and servitude; as wanting that power, which is the root and <span class="varspell" title="source">sourse</span> of all liberty, to dispose and <a href="" id="oeconomize" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="economize">&oelig;conomize</span> </span></a>  in the Land which God <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> them, as <span class="varspell" title="Masters">Maisters</span> of Family in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own house and free inheritance. Without which natural and essential power of a free Nation, though bearing high <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> heads, they can in due esteem be thought no better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> slaves and vassals born, in the tenure and occupation of another inheriting Lord. Whose <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span>, though not illegal, or intolerable, hangs over them as a Lordly scourge, not as a free <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span>; and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to be abrogated. How much more justly then may they fling off tyranny, or tyrants; who being once <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> can be no more the <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> men, as subject to the reach  of Justice and arraignment as any other transgressors. And certainly if men, not to speak of Heathen, both wise and Religious have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> justice upon Tyrants what way they could soonest, how much more <span class="varspell" title="mild">milde</span> <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> human then is it, to give them <span class="varspell" title="fair">faire</span> and <span class="varspell" title="open">op'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="trial">tryal</span>? To teach lawless Kings, and all who so much adore them, that not mortal man, or his imperious will, but Justice is the <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> true <span class="varspell" title="sovereign">sovran</span> and supreme Majesty upon earth. Let men cease <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> out of faction <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> <span class="varspell" title="hypocrisy">hypocrisie</span> to make <span class="varspell" title="outcries">out-cries</span> and horrid things of things so just and honorable. Though perhaps till now no protestant State or kingdom can be <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span> to have <span class="varspell" title="openly">op'nly</span> put to death <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> King, which lately some have <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span>, and imputed to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> great glory; much mistaking the matter. It is not, neither ought to be the glory of a Protestant State, never to have put <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> King to death; It is the glory of a Protestant King never to have <span class="varspell" title="deserved">deserv'd</span> death.

<p>These were the true Protestant Divines of <span class="mi">England, </span>  our fathers in the faith we hold; this was their sense, who for so many <span class="varspell" title="years">yeares</span> <span class="varspell" title="laboring">labouring</span> under Prelacy, through all <span class="varspell" title="storms">stormes</span> and persecutions kept Religion from extinguishing; and <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span> it pure to us, till there arose a covetous and ambitious generation of Divines (for Divines they call themselves) who <span class="varspell" title="feigning">feining</span> on a sudden to be new converts and proselytes from Episcopacy, under which they had long <span class="varspell" title="temporized">temporiz'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="opened">op'nd</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="mouths">mouthes</span> at length, in <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> against <a href="" id="pluralities" class="annotBtn">Pluralities</a> and Prelacy, but with intent to swallow them down both; gorging themselves like <a href="" id="harpy" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Harpies">Harpy's</span></a> on those <a href="" id="simony" class="annotBtn">simonious</a> places and preferments of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> outed predecessors, as the quarry for which they hunted, not to <span class="varspell" title="plurality">pluralitie</span> <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> but to multiplicitie: for possessing which they had <span class="varspell" title="accused">accusd</span> them <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Brethren, and aspiring <a href="" id="atitle" class="annotBtn">under another title</a> to the same <span class="varspell" title="authority">authoritie</span> and usurpation over the consciences of all men.
</p>

<p>Of this faction diverse reverend and <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> Divines, as they are <span class="varspell" title="styled">stil'd</span> in the <a href="" id="phylactery" class="annotBtn">Phylactery</a> of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own Title page, pleading the <span class="varspell" title="lawfulness">lawfulnes</span> of defensive <span class="varspell" title="Arms">Armes</span> against this King, in a Treatise <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> <a href="" id="scrip" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Scripture and Reason, </span></a>  seem in words to <span class="varspell" title="disclaime">disclaime</span> utterly the deposing of a King; but both the Scripture and the reasons which they use, draw consequences after them, which without their bidding, conclude it <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>. For if by Scripture, and by that especially <a href="" id="romans13" class="annotBtn">to the <span class="mi">Romans</span></a>,   which they most insist upon, Kings, doing that which is contrary to Saint <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paul's">Pauls</span></span>   definition of a <span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span>, may be resisted, they may altogether with as much force of consequence be <span class="varspell" title="deposed">depos'd</span> or <span class="varspell" title="punished">punishd</span>. And if by reason the unjust <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of Kings <span class="mi">may be <span class="varspell" title="forfeited">forfeted</span> in part, and his power be <span class="varspell" title="reassumed">reassum'd</span> in part, either by the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> or People, for the case in hazard and the present <span class="varspell" title="necessity">necessitie</span></span>, as they affirm <a href="" id="p34" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr></span> 34</a>, there can no Scripture be <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span>, no imaginable reason <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span>, that necessity continuing, as it may <span class="varspell" title="always">alwayes</span>, and they in all prudence and <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> duty may take upon them to foresee it, why in such a case they may not finally <a href="" id="amerce" class="annotBtn">amerce</a> him with the loss of his Kingdom, of whose amendment they have no hope. And if one wicked action persisted in against Religion, Laws, and liberties may warrant us to thus much in part, why may not forty times as many tyrannies, by him committed, warrant us to proceed on restraining him, till the restraint become total. For the ways of justice are exactest proportion; if for one trespass of a King it require so much <span class="varspell" title="remedy">remedie</span> or satisfaction, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> for twenty more as heinous crimes, it requires of him twenty fold; and so proportionably, till it <span class="varspell" title="come">com</span> to what is utmost among men. If in these proceedings against <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> King they may not finish by the usual <span class="varspell" title="course">cours</span> of justice what they have begun, they could not lawfully begin at all. For this <a href="" id="golden" class="annotBtn">golden rule of justice and <span class="varspell" title="morality">moralitie</span></a>, as well as of Arithmetic, out of three <span class="varspell" title="terms">termes</span> which they <span class="varspell" title="admit">admitt</span>, will as certainly and <span class="varspell" title="unavoidably">unavoydably</span> bring out the fourth, as any <span class="varspell" title="Problem">Probleme</span> that ever <a href="" id="euclid" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Euclid</span></a>, or <a href="" id="apollonius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Apollonius</span></a>   made good by demonstration.
</p>

<p>And if the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, being undeposable but by themselves, as is <span class="varspell" title="affirmed">affirm'd</span>, <a href="" id="p37" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr></span> 37, 38</a>, might for his whole life, if they saw cause, take all power, authority, and the sword out of his hand, which in effect is to unmagistrate him, why might they not, being then themselves the sole Magistrates in force, proceed to punish him who being lawfully <span class="varspell" title="deprived">depriv'd</span> of all things that define a Magistrate, can be now no Magistrate to be degraded lower, but an offender to be <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span>. Lastly, whom they may <span class="varspell" title="defy">defie</span>, and meet in <span class="varspell" title="battle">battell</span>, why may they not as well prosecute by justice? For <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="war">warr</span> is but the execution of justice against them who refuse Law. Among whom if it be <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> (as they deny not, <a href="" id="p19" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr></span> 19, 20.</a>) to slay the King himself <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> in front at his own peril, <span class="varspell" title="wherefore">wherfore</span> may not justice <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> that intendedly, which the chance of a defensive <span class="varspell" title="war">warr</span> might without blame have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> casually, nay purposely, if there it <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> him among the rest. They <span class="varspell" title="ask">aske</span> <a href="" id="p19a" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr></span> 19</a>. <span class="mi">By what rule of Conscience or God, a State is bound to sacrifice Religion, Laws and liberties, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a Prince defending such as subvert them, should <span class="varspell" title="come">com</span> in hazard of his life.</span> And I ask by what conscience, or divinity, or Law, or reason, a State is bound to leave all these sacred concernments under a perpetual hazard and extremity of danger, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="cut">cutt</span> off a wicked Prince, who <span class="varspell" title="sits">sitts</span> plotting 
day and night to subvert them: They tell us that the Law of nature justifies any man to defend himself, <span class="varspell" title="even">eev'n</span> against the King in Person: let them <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us then why the same Law, may not <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> much more a State or whole people, to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> justice upon him, against whom each <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> man may lawfully defend himself; seing all kind of justice <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, is a defence to good men, as well as a punishment to bad; and justice <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> upon a Tyrant is no more but the necessary self-defence of a whole Common wealth. To <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> upon a King, that his instruments may be brought to <a href="" id="condigne" class="annotBtn">condigne</a> punishment, and therafter to punish them the instruments, and not to spare <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>, but to defend and <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> him the Author, is the strangest <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of justice to be <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> Christian, and the strangest <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of reason to be <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> human, that by men of reverence and learning, as <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="style">stile</span> imports them, ever yet was vented. They maintain in the third and fourth Section, that a Judge or inferior Magistrate, is anointed of God, is his Minister, <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> the Sword in his hand, is to be <span class="varspell" title="obeyed">obey'd</span> by <a href="" id="peter_rule" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Peter's">Peters</span> </span>  rule</a>, as well as the Supreme, and without difference any where <span class="varspell" title="expressed">exprest</span>: and yet will have us fight against the Supreme till he remove and punish the inferior Magistrate (for such were greatest Delinquents) when as by Scripture, and by reason, there can no 
more <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> be shown to resist the one <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the other; and altogether as much, to punish or depose the Supreme himself, as to make <span class="varspell" title="War">Warr</span> upon him, till he punish or deliver up his inferior Magistrates, whom in the same terms we are commanded to obey, and not to resist. Thus while they, in a cautious line or two here and there <span class="varspell" title="stuffed">stuft</span> in, are <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> verbal against the pulling down or punishing of Tyrants, all the Scripture and the reason which they bring, is in every <span class="varspell" title="leaf">leafe</span> direct and rational to <span class="varspell" title="infer">inferr</span> it altogether as lawful, as to resist them. And yet in all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Sermons, as <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> by others <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> well noted, they went much <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span>. For Divines, if ye observe them, have <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> postures, and <a href="" id="motions" class="annotBtn">thir motions</a> no less expertly, and with no less variety <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> they that practice feats in the Artillery-ground. Sometimes they seem furiously to march on, and presently march counter; by and by they stand, and then retreat; or if need be can face about, or <span class="varspell" title="wheel">wheele</span> in a whole body, with that cunning and dexterity as is almost <span class="varspell" title="unperceivable">unperceavable</span>; to <span class="varspell" title="wind">winde</span> themselves by shifting ground into places of more advantage. And Providence <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> must be the drumm, Providence the word of command, that calls them from above, but always to <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> larger Benefice, or acts them into such or such figures, and promotions. At <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="turns">turnes</span> and doublings no men readier; to the right, or to the left; for it is <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="turns">turnes</span> 
which they serve <span class="varspell" title="chiefly">cheifly</span>; <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span>in only singular; that with them there is no certain hand right or left; but as <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own commodity thinks best to call it. But if there come a truth to be defended, which to them, and <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> interest of this world <span class="varspell" title="seems">seemes</span> not so profitable, <span class="varspell" title="straight">strait</span> these nimble motionists can <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> no <span class="varspell" title="even">eev'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="legs">leggs</span> to stand upon: and are no more of use to reformation throughly <span class="varspell" title="performed">performd</span>, and not superficially, or to the advancement of Truth (which among mortal men is <span class="varspell" title="always">alwaies</span> in <a href="" id="truth" class="annotBtn">her progress</a>) <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> if on a sudden they were <span class="varspell" title="struck">strook</span> <span class="varspell" title="maim">maime</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="crippled">crippl'd</span>. Which the better to <span class="varspell" title="conceal">conceale</span>, or the more to <span class="varspell" title="countenance">countnance</span> by a general conformity to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own limping, they would have <span class="mi">Scripture, </span>  they would have <span class="mi">reason </span>  also made to halt with them for company; and would <span class="varspell" title="put">putt</span> us off with impotent conclusions, lame and shorter <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the premises. In this posture they seem to stand with great <span class="varspell" title="zeal">zeale</span> and confidence on the wall of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Zion">Sion</span>; </span>  but like <a href="" id="jebusites" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Jebusites, </span></a>  not like <span class="mi">Israelites, </span>  or <span class="mi">Levites: </span>  <span class="varspell" title="blind">blinde</span> also as well as lame, they discern not <span class="mi">David </span>  from <a href="" id="adonibezec" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Adonibezec: </span></a>  but cry him up for the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> anointed, whose thumbs and great toes not long before they had cut off upon <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Pulpit cushions. <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> he who is our only King, the root of

But as to those before them which I cited first (and with an <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> search, for many more might be added) as they there stand, without more in number, being the best and chief of Protestant Divines, we may follow them for faithful Guides, and without doubting may receive them, as Witnesses abundant of what <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> <span class="varspell" title="affirm">affirme</span> concerning Tyrants. And indeed I find it generally the <span class="varspell" title="clear">cleere</span> and positive determination of them all, (not prelatical, or of this late faction subprelatical) who have <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> on this argument; that to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> justice on a lawless King, is to a <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> man unlawful, to an inferior Magistrate <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>: or if they were divided in opinion, yet greater <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> these here <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span>, or of more <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> in the Church, there can be none <span class="varspell" title="produced">produc'd</span>. If any one shall <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> about by bringing other testimonies to disable these, or by bringing these against themselves in 
other cited passages of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Books, he will not only <span class="varspell" title="fail">faile</span> to make good that <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> and impudent assertion of those mutinous Ministers, that the deposing and punishing of a King or Tyrant, <span class="mi">is against the constant Judgement of all Protestant Divines</span>, it being quite the contrary, but will prove rather, what perhaps he intended not, that the judgement of Divines, if it be so various and inconstant to it self, is not considerable, or to be <span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteem'd</span> at all. Ere which be <span class="varspell" title="yielded">yeilded</span>, as I hope it never will, these ignorant assertors in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own art will have <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> themselves more and more, not to be Protestant Divines, whose constant judgement in this point they have so audaciously <span class="varspell" title="belied">bely'd</span>, but rather to be a pack of <span class="varspell" title="hungry">hungrie</span> Church-wolves, who in the steps of <a href="" id="simon" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Simon Magus </span></a> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Father, following the hot <span class="varspell" title="scent">sent</span> of double Livings and Pluralities, <a href="" id="advousons" class="annotBtn">advousons, donatives, inductions, and augmentations</a>, though <span class="varspell" title="uncalled">uncall'd</span> to the Flock of Christ, but by the <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> suggestion of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Bellies, like those <a href="" id="bel" class="annotBtn">Priests of Bel</a>, whose pranks Daniel found out; have got possession, or rather <span class="varspell" title="seized">seis'd</span> upon the Pulpit, as the strong hold and fortress of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> sedition and rebellion against the civil Magistrate.
