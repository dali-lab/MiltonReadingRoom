var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  The \"slaughter\'d Saints\" of line 1 refer to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians\" target=\"main\">Waldensians or Vaudois</a>, a proto-protestant sect that had inhabited the mountainous Piedmont region since the late 12th century. Many English prostestants, perhaps even Milton, regarded the sect as a sort of remnant of first-century Christianity unsullied by Roman superstitition and corruption. Although technically excommunicate, this sect enjoyed some toleration, but in 1532 they allied themselves with Calvinists in France and Switzerland. Thus official tolerance for protestantism, formalized in the January Edict of 1561, applied to them so long as they confined themselves to certian designated remote regions.</p><p class=\"next\">In 1655 the Duke of Savoy enforced once again, with an army, the provision that Waldensians return to the remote mountain regions. Claiming they met widespread resistance, the army proceeded on the 24th of April, 1655, to massacre them, men women and children. Reports of atrocities committed by the Duke\'s army reached England and aroused the indignation of Cromwell\'s government. Milton was commissioned to write state letters communicating England\'s shock and its official, if disingenuous, disinclination to believe the French could be so brutal (see the letter he wrote on Cromwell\'s behalf to \"Lewis, King of France\" on July 29, 1655 as printed in <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:60630:107\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Letters of State </span> [1694] 153-57</a>).
