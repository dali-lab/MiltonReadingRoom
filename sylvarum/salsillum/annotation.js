"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. Milton titled this collection of Latin and Greek verses, \"Sylvarum,\" or \"of the woods,\" indicating the variety of metrical forms included, even a variety of languages, since two are in Greek. The metrical forms employed here include iambics, hexameters and various kinds of Horatian modes, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcaic_stanza\" target=\"main\">alcaic stanzas</a>. Milton arranged the poems in a roughly chronological order according to their dates of composition, probably to emphasize his progress as a poet from his earliest attempts to his more mature poems.</p><p class=\"next\"> Milton made two two-month visits to Rome, one in October and November 1638 and a return visit in January and February 1639.  This poem was probably composed, and first read aloud, at a Roman academy during Milton\'s first visit to Rome.  Giovanni Salzilli was a well-known member at the time of the Academici Fantastici in Rome, though his reputation as a Roman poet has not survived.  This poem responds to some <a href=\"../../poemata/english.shtml#salzilli\" target=\"main\">commendatory verses by  Salzilli</a> in which he flatteringly ranks Milton above Homer, Virgil, and Tasso.  In <a href=\"../../poemata/english.shtml#testimonials\" target=\"main\">his introduction</a> to these flattering testimonials, which he printed at the front of his Latin poems in both the 1645 and 1673 editions of <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span>, Milton acknowledges that they are conventionally exaggerated.  Milton\'s poem avoids such over-the-top exaggeration, praises Salzilli elegantly with Roman topoi, and expresses wishes for his future health.</p><p class=\"next\">The translation follows that of <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mackellar_latin\" target=\"main\">Walter MacKellar</a> with a few changes based on consulting <a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#columbia_milton\" target=\"main\">The Columbia Milton</a> and <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Merritt Y.
