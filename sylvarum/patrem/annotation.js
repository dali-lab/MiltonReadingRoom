"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. Milton titled this collection of Latin and Greek verses, \"Sylvarum,\" or \"of the woods,\" indicating the variety of metrical forms included, even a variety of languages, since two are in Greek. The metrical forms employed here include iambics, hexameters and various kinds of Horatian modes, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcaic_stanza\" target=\"main\">alcaic stanzas</a>. Milton arranged the poems in a roughly chronological order according to their dates of composition, probably to emphasize his progress as a poet from his earliest attempts to his more mature poems.</p><p class=\"next\">After he left Cambridge in 1632, M.A. in hand, Milton retired, as it were, to his father\'s home in the London suburb of Hammersmith.  About three years later the Miltons made their home chiefly in Horton in Buckinghamshire, and young John continued to live with them there.  During this period, of which we have very few records of any kind, Milton pursued a vigorous program of classical, historical and patristic study.  He was probably urged by his father and others to take holy orders.  His brother Christopher studied law at Lincoln\'s Inn.  Young John Milton, however, chose none of these career paths, nor that followed by his father, a scrivener and financier.  Milton chose to be a poet, and that must have caused his parents some concern.</p><p class=\"next\">In this poem Milton thanks his father for his continuing support, tries to answer his father\'s anxieties about his choice of careers, and celebrates his father\'s own talents as a musician and poet.  Milton\'s father was a musician and composer, especially of songs in parts for voices; he also wrote at least one poem that was published &mdash; commendatory verses for the first folio of Shakespeare\'s plays in 1623.  John Milton senior had been a trustee of <a href=\"http://web.uvic.ca/shakespeare/Library/SLTnoframes/stage/blackfriars1.html\" target=\"main\">Blackfriars Theatre</a>, famed as the winter quarters (after 1608) ofthe King\'s Men, the company of actors for whom Shakespeare served as chiefplaywright and also as a performer.   The first-folio commendation appears as \"<a href=\"../../on_shakespeare/1st_folio.shtml\" target=\"main\">To the memorie of M. <span class=\"mi\">W.Shake-speare</span></a>.\" on leaf A6.  You may also see it from <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/11596/9\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Early English Books Online</span></a>.</p><p class=\"next\">After more than five years of private study at his father\'s houses, Milton left, witha a manservant, for a tour of Europe, mostly Italy, taht lasted about fourteen or fifteen months, all at his father\'s expense.  While in Italy, Milton confirmed his resolution to become famous as a poet.</p><p class=\"next\">The translation follows that of <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mackellar_latin\" target=\"main\">Walter MacKellar</a> with a few changes based on consulting <a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#columbia_milton\" target=\"main\">The Columbia Milton</a> and <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Merritt Y.
