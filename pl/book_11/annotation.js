var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>.  Critics and readers alike have long ignored and undervalued the final two books of Milton\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost.</span>  In his <span class=\"booktitle\">Preface to Paradise Lost</span>, C. S. Lewis scathingly referred to the epic\'s denouement as \"an untransmuted lump of futurity\" (125).  Although not all readers share Lewis\' fervent dislike for books 11 and 12, <a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#john_rogers\" target=\"main\">John Rogers</a> notes that the books do \"strike most readers as a disappointment\" (282).  Milton\'s intricate exploration of human nature and equally ornate description of the physical world seem somewhat absent in this selectively episodic distillation of human history.  Critics have speculated that this shift signifies anything from Milton\'s \"loss of poetic power or of interest in the poem on one hand, or, on the other, to an intentional strategy to alter both Adam\'s perception of reality and our own\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#ann_coiro\" target=\"main\">Coiro</a>, \"\'To repair . . . \'\" 133).</p><p>Despite these criticisms, book 11 does merit and reward close attention from a careful reader.  Both the opening scene in Heaven and Michael\'s presentation of \"future\" history continue to explore many of the theological issues that Milton  features throughout <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span>:  the relationship between the Son and the Father, the distinction between predestination and foreknowledge, and the nature of divine Providence, to name a few.  <a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#john_rogers\" target=\"main\">Rogers</a> discusses two different kinds of Providence that he sees Milton attempting to reconcile in his article \"Milton and the Mysterious Terms of History.\"</p><p>The angel Michael\'s presentation of a providential view of human history also contains elements of typology, which is \"the matching of Old Testament with New Testament figures as types or echoes of each other.  It makes of the Bible a coherent and seamless document in which there are no contradictions\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#Flannagan\" target=\"main\">Flannagan</a> 308).  According to this supersessionist view, the history of the Hebrews foreshadows Christian history.  Michael\'s presentation of the \"One Just Man\" heroes, all of whom prefigure Jesus in some way, is one example of typology at work in book 11. Also, Milton\'s biblical references often come from both the Hebrew scriptures and the Christian scriptures, especially the Epistles, which often strive to present a typological view of history.</p><p>Readers should also take note of the educative nature of the discussions Adam and Michael have about the visions.  Adam\'s initial emotional and logical responses to the visions often reveal his newly fallen state of mind.  <a href=\"../../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#ann_coiro\" target=\"main\">Coiro</a> develops an interesting comparison between Michael\'s pedagogy and Milton\'s <a href=\"../../of_education/text.shtml\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Of Education</span></a> in her article \"\'To repair the ruins of our first parents\': Of Education and Adam,\" and <a href=\"../../bibliography/a-b/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">Michael Allen</a> also discusses Michael\'s pedagogy. </p><p>The book\'s conclusion lacks a sense of closure, perhaps because books 11 and 12 were originally one book (book 10) in Milton\'s <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/55152/162\" target=\"main\">1667 edition of <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span></a>.  Book 12, however supplies in its opening lines sufficient rationale for the division that separates the story of \"the world destroy\'d\" from that of \"the world restor\'d\" (12.3).  <span class=\"author\">Meg Fuchs &amp; Thomas Luxon</span></span>",
"Michael":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Michael</i>.  An <a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10275b.htm\" target=\"main\">archangel</a> mentioned in both the Bible and the Qu\'ran.

Later a specific place in Solomon\'s temple; see <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=1+Chronicles+28&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">1 Chronicles 28</a>:11-18.  Milton imagines a heavenly version.</span>",
"prevenient":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Prevenient Grace</i>.  According to Calvinist theology, the  unasked-for grace that comes before and enables repentance in otherwise totally depraved souls.</span>",
"flesh":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>new flesh</i>.  Milton conflates (in a perfectly orthodox fashion) <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Ezekiel+11&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Ezekiel 11</a>:19 with the Christian doctrine of new birth in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=2+Corinthians+5&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">2 Corinthians 5</a>:17.</span>",
"groan":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Unutterable</i>.  <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Romans/8.html\" target=\"main\">Romans 8:26 (Geneva)</a> describes how \"the Spirit\" intercedes for sinners with \"groans unutterable.\"  John Bunyan used this passage to argue before Justice Kelynge that the <span class=\"booktitle\">Book of Common Prayer</span> cannot teach a man to pray; only the Spirit can (<span class=\"booktitle\">A Relation of the Imprisonment of Mr. John Bunyan</span> in Sharrock, ed. <span class=\"booktitle\">Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners</span> 116).</span>",
"oratory":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Oratorie</i>.  Prayer spoken or sung according to a prescribed order of words.  Milton subscribes to the Puritan conviction that Spirit-inspired prayer is more truly prayer than prayers recited according to prescribed forms.</span>",
"port":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>port</i>. Deportment, attitude.</span>",
"pair":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>th\' ancient Pair</i>.  For the story of Deucalion and Pyrrha see Ovid\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:1.253\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span> 1</a>.314-449.</span>",
"less":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>less ancient yet than these</i>.  Milton reminds his readers that Deucalion and Pyrrha postdate Adam and Eve; Milton often makes classical allusions that both engage and  undercut their authority.</span>",
"windes":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>envious windes</i>.  Compare to the cross winds that blow religious articles  and vestments into the Limbo of Vanity in <a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#wind\" target=\"main\">3.487</a>.</span>",
"diment":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Dimentionless</i>.  Without dimension, spiritual.  Not, however, as some have suggested, immaterial, since for Milton all things, even spiritual, dimensionless things, come from \"one first matter\" (<a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#spirit\" target=\"main\">5.469-479</a>).</span>",
"incense":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>incense</i>.  See <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Ezekiel+20&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Ezekiel 20</a>:41.</span>",

"savour":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>more pleasing savour</i>.  The Son says that these prayers of contrition, grown from the Father\'s planting in Adam, are sweeter than any gift Adam could have grown and offered, even before he fell from obedience.</span>",
"sighs":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>his sighs</i>.  Not \"their\" sighs, but \"his\" sighs, produced by God\'s \"implanted grace in Man.\"  Presumably, Adam will either intercede for Eve as the Son does for him, or his redemption, as the saying goes, covers her as well.</span>",

"one":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Made one with me</i>.  Milton imagines that the Son has always, even from Adam\'s day, been an intercessor between man and God, and that the act of redemption began even before Adam\'s first sin and repentance; see the Father\'s speech in <a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#redeem\" target=\"main\">3.216</a>, <a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#line270\" target=\"main\">274</a>.</span>",
"cloud":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>without Cloud</i>.  In the Hebrew Bible, God is often said to appear in a cloud, as in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Exodus+16&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Exodus 16</a>:10, but the Son, in Milton\'s poem, sees God directly.</span>",
"law":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>The Law I gave to Nature</i>. <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#john_rogers\" target=\"main\"> John Rogers</a> observes that this is the first of two methods of expulsion the Father discusses; in this passage, ordinary providence (the law God gave to Nature) will automatically expel Adam and Eve\'s now-sinful bodies from Paradise.</span>",
"fond":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fondly</i>.  Foolishly; see <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#charm\" target=\"main\">9.999</a> and see <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>.</span>",
"remedie":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>His final remedie</i>.  God reveals that Death is not only a punishment; sometimes it is also a blessing.</span>",
"works":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Faith and faithful works</i>.  Milton\'s formula of faith and works differs significantly from Luther\'s \"faith alone\"  in his <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/l/luther/large_catechism/large_catechism25.htm\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Larger Catechism</span></a>. </span>",

"one2":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>like one of us</i>.  The Father addresses the angels, which offers to account for the use of the plural \"us\" here and in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+3&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 3</a>:22.</span>",
"forbidden":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>defended</i>.  Forbidden.</span>",
"knowledge":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>knowledge of Good</i>.  In <a href=\"../../areopagitica/text.shtml#goodandevil\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Areopagitica</span></a>, Milton argues that good can be known only in relation to evil.  In this passage, however, he seems to suggest that prelapsarian knowledge of good, independent of knowledge of evil, was superior.</span>",
"or":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Or . . . or</i>.  Either . . . or.</span>",
"vacant":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Vacant possession</i>.  Under common law, property left vacant could be claimed by a squatter; the Father fears that Satan would try to claim Eden were it left unguarded.  See \"vacant\" in <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>.</span>",
"drive":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>drive out</i>. The second method of expulsion: God uses extraordinary providence (direct intervention) to evict Adam and Eve by sending Michael, his representative, to perform the task.  For a further discussion of the function of providence and intervention in the poem, see <a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/index.shtml\" target=\"main\">Rogers</a>.</span>",
"excess":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>thir excess</i>.  Most commentators gloss this as \"their transgression,\"   but see <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a> where the first sense offered is \"the act of going out.\"  Certainly, by strict Aristotelian ethics, Adam\'s transgression is an \"excess,\" but I think the more immediate sense is simply the enforced leaving of Eden.</span>",
"seed":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Cov\'nant in the womans seed</i>.  See the <a href=\"../book_10/text.shtml#covenant1\" target=\"main\">Argument</a> for book 10, <a href=\"../book_10/text.shtml#enmity\" target=\"main\">10.179-81</a>, and <a href=\"../book_10/text.shtml#bruise\" target=\"main\">10.1032</a>.</span>",

"janus":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>double Janus</i>.  Since a Janus is a two-faced figure often found on Roman gates, a double Janus would be four-faced; perhaps the cherubs\' flaming faces would be oriented to the four cardinal compass points, guarding access to Eden and the Tree of Life.

The story is from <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+4&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 4</a>.  In Genesis 4:3-4, we are told that Abel brought \"firstlings\" from his flock and Cain brought \"an offering of the fruit of the ground\"; Milton (and other commentators) inferred that Cain\'s offering was \"uncull\'d\" and therefore unacceptable to God.</span>",
"meek":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>meek</i>.   Milton views meekness as a positive quality in men.

"intemp":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Intemperance</i>.  Milton probably uses this term in quite a precise Aristotelian fashion; see <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng1:1117b.1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Nicomachean Ethics</span> 1117b</a>. </span>",
"lazar":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Lazar-house</i>.  Hospital for incurably ill and infectious patients, especially lepers.</span>",
"demon":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>D&aelig;moniac Phrenzie</i>.  Physicians in the 17th century still believed that many mental illnesses were caused by  demonic or Satanic possession, and exorcisms were common.  Mental illness was also thought to be caused by an imbalance of the bodily humors (blood, phlegm, choler, and black bile).  Finally, people believed that mental illness, whatever its physical cause, was punishment for sin (both the original sin of Adam and Eve and the sin of the mad indivdual).</span>",
"moap":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>moaping Melancholie</i>.  One example of the abundant alliteration in this passage.  Melancholy, or depression, was believed to be caused by an overabundance of black bile (one of the four humors).</span>",
"pin":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>pining Atrophie Marasmus</i>.  Marantic atrophy, caused by extreme malnutrion and low protein intake.  <span class=\"mi\">Marasmus</span> means \"withering\" in Greek.</span>",
"oft":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>oft invokt</i>.  There is a long classical tradition of invoking death; see, for example, Sophocles\' <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006.perseus-eng2:782\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Philoctetes</span> 797-798</a>, Horace\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0893.phi001.perseus-eng1:2.18\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Odes</span> 2.18.38-40</a>, and Pliny\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Natural History</span> 7.1.167.</span>",
"unman":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>best of Man</i>.  Shedding tears is proverbially unmanly.  Sadness, even being emotionally moved, is not unmanly (see 453 above), but tears are.  Adam\'s tears are unusual: he is so moved that he weeps, even though he was not born of a woman and thus has no \"woman\" in him.</span>",
"manly":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>recovering words</i>.  As a man, Adam\'s proper means of expressing emotion is supposed to be through words and \"firmer thoughts,\" that is, reason and discourse.  See <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#yielded\" target=\"main\">4.489-491</a>.</span>",
"better":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Better end heer unborn</i>.  After seeing Death, Adam perhaps unconsciously echoes Eve\'s earlier wish to save their descendents from death by never begetting them (<a href=\"../book_10/text.shtml#line975\" target=\"main\">10.979-91</a>).</span>",
"erect":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>erect</i>.  In <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#erect\" target=\"main\">4.288-289</a>, Adam and Eve\'s erect stature shows their physical resemblance to God.</span>",
"whom":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>His Image whom they serv\'d</i>.  After the fall, God\'s image in Man is lost, and Man instead comes to resemble the images of the various vices he serves. See <a href=\"../../comus/text.shtml#bacchus\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask</span> 63-77</a> for an example of transformation as a result of sin.</span>",
"con":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>connatural</i>. Of the same nature.</span>",
"temper":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>temperance</i>.  Aristotle\'s rule of the mean (<a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng1:1117b.1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Nicomachean Ethics</span> 1117b</a>).</span>",
"volant":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>volant</i>.  Nimble, flying.</span>",
"instinct":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Instinct through all proportions</i>.  The use of the word \"proportions\" suggests that Milton is referring to theories of speculative music (musica speculativa) that were in vogue in the 17th century. Speculative music explores the concept that the entire universe is resonating with a chord and that the music created by man on earth (musica practica) is, or should be, an attempt to find and join the heavenly harmonies. Apparently this musician can instinctively find the exact proportions (frequencies) of the music of the spheres.</span>",
"fugue":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fugue</i>.  In the 17th century, fugues were associated with Masses and other worship services. The fugue is a rigidly structured form of music that is essentially an ornamented canon. The word \"canon\" also refers to church law, a secondary meaning of which Milton was surely aware (see <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>).</span>",
"clods":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>clods</i>. Lumps.</span>",
"fusil":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Fusil</i>.  Cast.  Milton is at some pains to account for how metals like these would have been obtained before mining was known.  His notion of how metals and metallurgy were first discovered comes from Lucretius\'s <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.5.v.html#1791\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">On the Nature of Things</span> 5.1791</a>.</span>",
"seemd":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>they seemd</i>.  That is, to Adam or any other human observer.  Milton\'s story is from <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+6&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 6</a>, a passage about the origins of \"the nephilim,\" or giants; see Calvin\'s <a href=\"http://calvarychapel.com/library/calvin-john/01a.htm#Chap6\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Commentary</span></a>.</span>",
"eyed":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>ey\'d them</i>.  The story of \"The Sons of God\" from <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+6&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 6</a> has invited a wide variety of interpretations.  Some commentators, following the Book of <a href=\"http://reluctant-messenger.com/1enoch01-60.htm#Chapter15\" target=\"main\">Enoch</a> (Chapter 15), took the \"Sons of God\" to be angels who had lusted after women, coupled with them, and produced a race of giants.  This is the interpretation Milton alludes to in <a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#angellust\" target=\"main\">5.446-448</a>, though he expresses doubts about the veracity of this reading.  In book 11, Milton seems to opt for the reading favored by many reformed commentators &mdash; that the \"Sons of God\" were the descendants of Seth and lived in the mountains pursuing a life of piety, learning, and special skills until they descended to the plain, \"eyed\" the daughters of Cain, and were forever corrupted.  The offspring of these unions became the corrupt men who prompted God to flood the world.  But in <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span>, Milton opts for a different reading of Genesis 6\'s \"Sons of God\" (<a href=\"../../pr/book_2/text.shtml#sons_of_god\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span> 2.178-181</a>).  See <a href=\"http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"main\">Arnold Williams, <span class=\"booktitle\">Common Expositor</span></a>.</span>",
"love":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>of love they treat</i>.  These seemingly \"just men\" turn their attention from the study of right worship, natural science, and political science (lines 577-580) to the composition of love ditties (584) as soon as they descend from their mountain habitation to the plain below.  In <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#austin\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span></a>, Milton argues that men must sometimes \"slack\" their intense study and vacation, as it were, in the company of women, but these men appear to have abandoned study altogether.</span>",
"star":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Eevening Star</i>.  Venus, the planet of love.</span>",
"Hymen":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Hymen</i>.  Milton says that marriage was instituted in Paradise before the fall, coincident with the creation of Eve; see<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#ledbygod\" target=\"main\"> 8.484-499</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 2</a>:18-24.  But not until after the fall was <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=42715\" target=\"main\">Hymen</a>, the god of marriage, invoked at weddings.</span>",
"symph":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Symphonies</i>.  In the 17th century, a \"symphony\" was simply a piece for instruments (winds, keyboard, gambas, etc.); the symphony had no strict form.  Symphonies were a form of secular music and often served as dance music, especially in France.  After these \"[j]ust men\" interact with the women, their music changes from sacred and structured (fugues) to secular and free (symphonies).</span>",
"bent":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>bent of Nature</i>.  Adam ascribes his decision to disobey God to the \"bent\" or \"bond\" or \"link\"; see <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#naturelink\" target=\"main\">9.914</a> and <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#naturebond\" target=\"main\">9.956</a>.    Apparently, \"bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh\" (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 2</a>:23) has both a spiritual sense and a carnal sense.  According to Milton, the spiritual sense (see <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">4.741-743</a> and <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Ephesians+5&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Ephesians 5</a>:31-32), existed before the fall, and the carnal sense helps to cause the fall.</span>",
"fulfilld":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Nature seems fulfilld</i>.  See Comus\'s arguments about Nature\'s purposes in <a href=\"../../comus/text.shtml#nature\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask</span> 710-729</a>.  I have always suspected it was this passage of <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> that gave Stanley Fish the idea for <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#fishsin\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Surprised by Sin</span></a>.</span>",
"pleasure":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>By pleasure</i>.  For Aristotle\'s extended dicussion of the relationship between pleasure and the good, see <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng1:1147b.1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Nicomachean Ethics</span> 1147b</a>.</span>",
"tents":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Of wickedness</i>.  See <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Psalm+84&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Psalm 84</a>:10.</span>",
"praise":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>chief praise</i>.  Michael echoes Adam\'s statement about \"houshold good\" in <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#houshold_good\" target=\"main\">9.232-234</a>.  Compare this, however, to Adam\'s confidential talk with Raphael about Eve\'s beauty in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#beauty\" target=\"main\">8.533-559</a>.</span>",
"appetence":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>appetence</i>.  Appetite.</span>",
"troule":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>troule</i>.  The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>, citing this use of \"troule,\" defines it as moving (the tongue) \"volubly.\"</span>",
"traines":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>traines</i>.  Traps, wiles; see <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>.  See also <a href=\"../../samson/drama/text.shtml#trains\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> 533</a>.</span>",
"slackness":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Mans effeminate slackness</i>.  Michael upbraids Adam for his simplistic misogyny in laying all the blame on Eve.  Milton proposes a far more sophisticated, but still misogynistic, account of blame for the fall.  Adam was the first to \"yield up\" his \"manly grace/ And wisdom which alone is truly fair\" (<a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#beauty\" target=\"main\">4.490-491</a>) and to \"fondly\" subordinate his manliness to \"femal charm\" (<a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#charm\" target=\"main\">9.999</a>).  Adam\'s disobedience, according to Milton, is also a failure of the self-esteem proper to manliness (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#outside\" target=\"main\">8.568-575</a>), and a failure to esteem Eve\'s beauty for what it is;  in a sense, Adam allowed Eve, for a moment at least, to be his \"god\" (<a href=\"../book_10/text.shtml#thygod\" target=\"main\">10.145</a>).  On \"slackness,\" see also <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#austin\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span></a>; on \"effeminacy,\" see <a href=\"../../samson/drama/text.shtml#line410\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson</span> 410</a>.  </span>",
"concours":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Concours</i>.  Hostile encounter; see <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>.</span>",
"giants":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Giants</i>.  The offspring of the Sons of God and the \"fair Atheists\" (see earlier <a href=\"notes.shtml#eyed\" target=\"notes\">note</a>).</span>",
"fat":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fat Meddow</i>.  Fertile meadow.</span>",
"callin":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>call in</i>.  All one word in the 1674 edition: \"callin\";  I have taken the liberty of separating the two words.</span>",
"ensanguind":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>ensanguind</i>.  Bloodied.</span>",
"one3":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>one rising, eminent</i>.  Enoch, the first of the \"One Just Man\" (line 681 below) heroes Milton lists.  Enoch, according to <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Genesis/5.html\" target=\"main\">Genesis 5:21-24 (Geneva)</a>, was the father of Methuselah, and he lived a godly life for 365 years; he never died for \"God took him.\"  <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Hebrews+11&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Hebrews 11:5</a> says Enoch was \"translated\" \"by faith.\"  See also <a href=\"http://reluctant-messenger.com/1enoch01-60.htm\" target=\"main\">Enoch</a> Chapter 14:8-9 and  <a href=\"http://www.hti.umich.edu/bin/rsv-idx?type=DIV2&amp;byte=4132174\" target=\"main\">Sirach 44</a>:16 and <a href=\"http://www.hti.umich.edu/bin/rsv-idx?type=DIV2&amp;byte=4151652\" target=\"main\">49</a>:14.  Milton\'s treatment of Enoch and the other heroes from the Hebrew scriptures demonstrates his successionist view of history: these men are all regarded as prefigurations of Jesus, the most important and only fully successful  of the \"One Just Man\" heroes.</span>",
"Exploded":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Exploded</i>.  Hooted and jeered off the stage.  See <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>.</span>",
"heroic":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Heroic Vertu\'call\'d</i>.  Readers will recall Milton\'s diatribe about traditional epic heroism in the early lines of <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#heroic\" target=\"main\">book 9</a>.</span>",
"seventh":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>the seventh from thee</i>.  That is, the seventh generation, or Enoch; see <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Jude&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Jude 1</a>:14.</span>",
"bcloud":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>balmie Cloud</i>.  Elijah was taken up into the clouds in a similar manner (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=2+Kings+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">2 Kings 2</a>:11).  See also the closing lines of <a href=\"../../damon/text.shtml#damon\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Damon\'s Epitaph</span></a>.</span>",
"noah":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Reverend Sire</i>.  Noah, the second in Milton\'s line of solitary Just Men.  The story of Noah begins in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+6&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 6</a>:9 and ends in chapter 9.  Milton also alludes to some details from Josephus\'s <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.72\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Antiquities</span> 1.80</a>.</span>",
"sevens":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>seavens, and pairs</i>.  See <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+7&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 7</a>:2.</span>",
"wind":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Southwind</i>.  The description of the southwind recalls Ovid\'s narration of the Deucalion and Pyrrha story in <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:1.253\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span> 1</a>.264-226.</span>",
"thou":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>thou</i>.  Throughout book 11, Milton\'s narrator (\"the epic voice\") has been a passive observer describing the visions Adam has seen,  but here, the narrator directly addresses Adam in a brief apostrophe.</span>",
"enough":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Anough to bear</i>.  Echoes <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Matthew+6&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Matthew 6</a>:34.</span>",
