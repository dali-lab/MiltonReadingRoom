var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i> Milton probably intended \"The Passion\"  as a companion piece to <a href=\"../nativity/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"On the Morning of Christs Nativity\"</a> and possibly \"<a href=\"../upon_the_circumcision/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">Upon the Circumcision</a>.\" Written for Easter 1630, this work examines the death of Jesus.  Milton thought this poem was a poor specimen of his ability and most critics agree, rating it as his worst English poem. Like many seventeenth-century Protestants, Milton found the subject of the crucifixion very difficult, perhaps because of centuries of iconic treatment in the Roman Catholic and orthodox traditions.  Milton never thoroughly revised the poem between its first publication in <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/114721/13\" target=\"main\">1645</a> and its final printing during his life in 1673.  He included it, unfinished, in the 1645 collection probably because he intended that collection (and its re-issue in 1673) as a record of his juvenalia.  This might also account for the engraved portrait of the poet \"at age 21\" as the frontispiece; Milton was 36 for most of 1645.  One textual change exists: \"latter\" in line 22  became \"latest\" in <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/60223/16\" target=\"main\">1673</a>.
