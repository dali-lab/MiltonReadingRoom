At <span class="mi">Jordan</span> with the Baptist, and had seen<br />
Him whom they heard so late expressly <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span><br />
Jesus <a href="" id="mes" class="annotBtn">Messiah</a> Son of God <span class="varspell" title="declared">declar'd</span>,<br />

And on that high Authority had <span class="varspell" title="believed">believ'd</span>,<span class="line" id="line5"> [ 5 ]</span><br />
And with him <span class="varspell" title="talked">talkt</span>, and with him <span class="varspell" title="lodged">lodg'd</span>, I mean<br />

With others though in Holy Writ not <span class="varspell" title="named">nam'd</span>,<br />
Now missing him <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> joy so lately found,<br />

So lately found, and so abruptly gone,<span class="line" id="line10"> [ 10 ]</span><br />                        
Began to doubt, and doubted many days,<br />
And as the days <span class="varspell" title="increased">increas'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="increased">increas'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> doubt:<br />
Sometimes they thought he might be only <span class="varspell" title="shown">shewn</span>,<br />
And for a time caught up to God, as once<br />

<a href="" id="moses" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Moses</span></a> was in the Mount, and missing long;<span class="line" id="line15"> [ 15 ]</span><br />
And the great <a href="" id="thisbite" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Thisbite</span></a> who on fiery wheels<br />
Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.<br />
Therefore as those young Prophets then with care<br />
<a href="" id="eli" class="annotBtn">Sought</a> lost <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Elijah">Eliah</span></span>, so in each place these<br />

Nigh to <span class="mi">Bethabara</span>; in <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jericho">Jerico</span></span><span class="line" id="line20"> [ 20 ]</span><br />
The City of Palms, <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Aenon">&AElig;non</span></span>, and <span class="mi">Salem</span> Old,<br />
<span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Machaerus">Mach&aelig;rus</span></span> and each Town or City <span class="varspell" title="walled">wall'd</span><br />
On this side the broad lake <span class="mi">Genezaret</span>,<br />
Or in <a href="" id="places" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Perea</span></a>, but <span class="varspell" title="returned">return'd</span> in vain.<br />

Then on the bank of <span class="mi">Jordan</span>, by a Creek:<span class="line" id="line25"> [ 25 ]</span><br />
Where winds with Reeds and Osiers <span class="varspell" title="whispering">whisp'ring</span> play<br />
Plain <a href="" id="fish" class="annotBtn">Fishermen</a>, no greater men them call,<br />
Close in a Cottage low together got<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Their">Thir</span> unexpected loss and plaints out <span class="varspell" title="breathed">breath'd</span>.<br />

Alas, <a href="" id="from" class="annotBtn">from what</a> high hope to what relapse<span class="line" id="line30"> [ 30 ]</span><br />
<span class="varspell" title="Unlooked">Unlook'd</span> for are we <span class="varspell" title="fallen">fall'n</span>,  our eyes beheld<br />
Messiah certainly now come, so long<br />
Expected of our Fathers; we have heard<br />
His words, his wisdom <a href="" id="flesh" class="annotBtn">full of grace and truth</a>,<br />

Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand,<span class="line" id="line35"> [ 35 ]</span><br />
The Kingdom shall to <span class="mi">Israel</span> be <span class="varspell" title="restored">restor'd</span>:<br />
Thus we <span class="varspell" title="rejoiced">rejoyc'd</span>, but soon our joy is <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span><br />
Into perplexity and new amaze:<br />
For whither is he gone, what accident<br />

Hath <a href="" id="rapt" class="annotBtn">rapt</a> him from us? will he now retire<span class="line" id="line40"> [ 40 ]</span><br />
After appearance, and again prolong<br />
Our expectation?  God of <span class="mi">Israel</span>,<br />
Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come;<br />
Behold the <a href="" id="kings" class="annotBtn">kings of the  Earth</a> how they oppress<br />

Thy chosen, to what <span class="varspell" title="height">highth</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="power">pow'r</span> unjust<span class="line" id="line45"> [ 45 ]</span><br />
They have exalted, and behind them cast<br />
All fear of thee, arise and vindicate<br />
Thy Glory, free thy people from <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> yoke,<br />
But let us wait; thus far He hath <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</span>,<br />

Sent his Anointed, and to us <span class="varspell" title="revealed">reveal'd</span> him,<span class="line" id="line50"> [ 50 ]</span><br />
By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown,<br />
In <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span>, and with him we have <span class="varspell" title="conversed">convers'd</span>;<br />
Let us be glad of this, and all our fears<br />
Lay on his Providence; he will not fail<br />

Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall,<span class="line" id="line55"> [ 55 ]</span><br />
Mock us with his <span class="varspell" title="blessed">blest</span> sight, then snatch him hence,<br />
Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return.
</p>
<p>
Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume<br />
To find whom at the first they found unsought:<br />

But to his Mother <span class="mi">Mary</span>, when she saw<span class="line" id="line60"> [ 60 ]</span><br />
Others <span class="varspell" title="returned">return'd</span> from Baptism, not her Son,<br />
Nor left at <span class="mi">Jordan</span>, <span class="varspell" title="tidings">tydings</span> of him none;<br />
Within her <span class="varspell" title="breast">brest</span>, though calm; her <span class="varspell" title="breast">brest</span> though pure,<br />
<a href="" id="Motherly" class="annotBtn">Motherly cares</a> and fears got head, and <span class="varspell" title="raised">rais'd</span><br />

Some <span class="varspell" title="troubled">troubl'd</span> thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad.<span class="line" id="line65"> [ 65 ]</span>
</p>
<p>
O what avails me now that <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> high<br />
To have <span class="varspell" title="conceived">conceiv'd</span> of God, or that <a href="" id="salute" class="annotBtn">salute</a>,<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Hail">Hale</span> highly <span class="varspell" title="favored">favour'd</span>, among women <span class="varspell" title="blessed">blest</span>; <br />
While I to sorrows am no less <span class="varspell" title="advanced">advanc't</span>,<br />

And fears as eminent, above the lot<span class="line" id="line70"> [ 70 ]</span><br />
Of other women, by the birth I bore,<br />
In such a season born when scarce a Shed<br />
Could be <span class="varspell" title="obtained">obtain'd</span> to shelter him or me<br />
From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth,<br />

A Manger his; yet soon <span class="varspell" title="enforced">enforc't</span> to <span class="varspell" title="fly">flye</span><span class="line" id="line75"> [ 75 ]</span><br />
Thence into <span class="mi">Egypt</span>, till the <a href="" id="murder" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Murderous">Murd'rous</span> King</a><br />
Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing <span class="varspell" title="filled">fill'd</span><br />
With Infant blood the streets of <span class="mi">Bethlehem</span>;<br />
From <span class="mi">Egypt</span> home <span class="varspell" title="returned">return'd</span>, in <a href="" id="naz" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Nazareth</span></a><br />

Hath been our dwelling many years, his life<span class="line" id="line80"> [ 80 ]</span><br />
Private, unactive, calm, contemplative,<br />
Little suspicious to any King; but now<br />
Full grown to Man, <span class="varspell" title="acknowledged">acknowledg'd</span>, as I hear,<br />
By <span class="mi">John</span> the Baptist, and in <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> shown,<br />

Son <span class="varspell" title="owned">own'd</span> from Heaven by his Father's voice;<span class="line" id="line85"> [ 85 ]</span><br />
I <span class="varspell" title="looked">look't</span> for some great change; to <span class="varspell" title="Honor">Honour</span>? no,<br />
But trouble, as old <a href="" id="sim" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Simeon</span> plain <span class="varspell" title="foretold">fore-told</span></a>,<br />
That to the fall and rising he should be<br />
Of many in <span class="mi">Israel</span>, and to a sign<br />

Spoken against, that through my very Soul<span class="line" id="line90"> [ 90 ]</span><br />
A sword shall pierce; this is my <span class="varspell" title="favored">favour'd</span> lot,<br />
My Exaltation to Afflictions high;<br />
Afflicted I may be, it seems, and <span class="varspell" title="blessed">blest</span>;<br />
I will not argue that, nor will repine.<br />

But where delays he now?  some great intent<span class="line" id="line95"> [ 95 ]</span><br />
Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen,<br />
<a href="" id="temple" class="annotBtn">I lost him</a>, but so found, as well I saw<br />
He could not <a href="" id="lose" class="annotBtn">lose</a> himself; but went about<br />
His Father's business; what he meant I <span class="varspell" title="mused">mus'd</span>,<br />

Since understand; much more his absence now<span class="line" id="line100"> [ 100 ]</span><br />
Thus long to some great purpose he <a href="" id="obs" class="annotBtn">obscures</a>.<br />
But I to wait with patience am <span class="varspell" title="inured">inur'd</span>;<br />
My <a name="mary">heart</a> hath been a <span class="varspell" title="storehouse">store-house</span> long of things<br />
And <a href="" id="sayings" class="annotBtn">sayings laid up</a>, portending strange events.
</p>
<p>
Thus <span class="mi">Mary</span> pondering oft, and oft to mind<span class="line" id="line105"> [ 105 ]</span><br />
Recalling what remarkably had <span class="varspell" title="passed">pass'd</span><br />
Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts<br />
Meekly <span class="varspell" title="composed">compos'd</span> awaited the fulfilling:<br />
The while her Son <a href="" id="tracing" class="annotBtn">tracing</a> the Desert wild,<br />

Sole but with holiest Meditations fed,<span class="line" id="line110"> [ 110 ]</span><br />
Into himself descended, and at once<br />
All his great work to come before him set;<br />
How to begin, how to accomplish best<br />
His end of being on Earth, and mission high:<br />

For Satan with <span class="varspell" title="sly">slye</span> <a href="" id="preface" class="annotBtn">preface to return</a><span class="line" id="line115"> [ 115 ]</span><br />
Had left him <a href="" id="vacant" class="annotBtn">vacant</a>, and with speed was <span class="varspell" title="gone">gon</span><br />
Up to the middle Region of thick Air,<br />
Where all his Potentates in Council <span class="varspell" title="sat">sate</span>;<br />
There without sign of boast, or sign of joy,<br />

<span class="varspell" title="Solicitous">Sollicitous</span> and <a href="" id="blank" class="annotBtn">blank</a> he thus began.<span class="line" id="line120"> [ 120 ]</span></p>
<p>
Princes, <span class="varspell" title="Heaven's">Heavens</span> <span class="varspell" title="ancient">antient</span> Sons, <span class="varspell" title="Ethereal">&AElig;thereal</span> Thrones,<br />
Demonian Spirits now, from <a name="element">the Element</a><br />
Each of his reign allotted, rightlier <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span>,<br />
Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath,<br />

So may we hold our place and these mild seats<span class="line" id="line125"> [ 125 ]</span><br />
Without new trouble; such an Enemy<br />
Is <span class="varspell" title="risen">ris'n</span> to invade us, who no less<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Threatens">Threat'ns</span> <a href="" id="then" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="than">then</span></a> our expulsion down to Hell;<br />
I, as I undertook, and with the vote<br />

Consenting in <a href="" id="frequence" class="annotBtn">full frequence</a> was <span class="varspell" title="empowered">impow'r'd</span>,<span class="line" id="line130"> [ 130 ]</span><br />

Far other <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="undergone">undergon</span><br />
<a href="" id="Then" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Than">Then</span></a> when I dealt with <span class="mi">Adam</span> first of Men,<br />
Though <span class="mi">Adam</span> by his <span class="varspell" title="Wife's">Wives</span> allurement fell,<br />

However to this Man inferior far,<span class="line" id="line135"> [ 135 ]</span><br />
If he be Man by <span class="varspell" title="Mother's">Mothers</span> side at least,<br />
With more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> gifts from <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span> <span class="varspell" title="adorned">adorn'd</span>,<br />
Perfections absolute, Graces divine,<br />
And <a href="" id="amp" class="annotBtn">amplitude of mind</a> to greatest Deeds.<br />

Therefore I am <span class="varspell" title="returned">return'd</span>, lest confidence<span class="line" id="line140"> [ 140 ]</span><br />
Of my success with <span class="mi">Eve</span> in Paradise<br />
Deceive ye to <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> over-sure<br />
Of like succeeding here; I summon all<br />
Rather to be in readiness with hand<br />

Or counsel to assist; lest I, who erst<span class="line" id="line145"> [ 145 ]</span><br />
Thought none my equal, now be <span class="varspell" title="overmatched">over-match'd</span>.
</p>
<p>
So spake <a href="" id="old" class="annotBtn">the old Serpent</a> doubting, and from all<br />
With <span class="varspell" title="clamor">clamour</span> was <span class="varspell" title="assured">assur'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> utmost aid<br />
At his command; when from <a name="belial">amidst</a> them rose<br />

<a href="" id="belian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Belial</span></a> the dissolutest Spirit that fell,<span class="line" id="line150"> [ 150 ]</span><br />
The sensuallest, and after <a href="" id="as" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Asmodai</span></a><br />

<p>
Set women in his eye and in his walk,<br />

Many are in each Region <a href="" id="passing" class="annotBtn">passing fair</a><span class="line" id="line155"> [ 155 ]</span><br />

Draw out with credulous desire, and lead<br />
At will the manliest, resolutest <span class="varspell" title="breast">brest</span>,<br />
As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws.<br />
Women, when nothing else, <span class="varspell" title="beguiled">beguil'd</span> the heart<br />

Of wisest <a href="" id="mon" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Solomon</span></a>, and made him build,<span class="line" id="line170"> [ 170 ]</span><br />
And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives.</p>

To be at hand, and at his beck appear,<br />
If cause were to unfold some active Scene<br />

Of various persons, each to know his part;<span class="line" id="line240"> [ 240 ]</span><br />

Where still from shade to shade the Son of God<br />
After forty days fasting had <span class="varspell" title="remained">remain'd</span>,<br />
Now <span class="varspell" title="hungering">hungring</span> first, and to himself thus said.

Under the hospitable covert nigh<br />

Of meats and drinks, <span class="varspell" title="Nature's">Natures</span> refreshment sweet;<span class="line" id="line265"> [ 265 ]</span><br />
Him thought, he by the <a href="" id="leo" class="annotBtn">Brook of <span class="mi">Cherith</span></a> stood<br />
And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks<br />
Food to <span class="mi">Elijah</span> bringing Even and Morn,<br />
Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought:<br />

He saw the Prophet also how he fled<span class="line" id="line270"> [ 270 ]</span><br />
Into the Desert, and how there he slept<br />
Under a Juniper; then how <span class="varspell" title="awaked">awakt</span>,<br />
He found his Supper on the coals <span class="varspell" title="prepared">prepar'd</span>,<br />
And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,<br />

And eat the second time after repose,<span class="line" id="line275"> [ 275 ]</span><br />
The strength whereof <span class="varspell" title="sufficed">suffic'd</span> him forty days;<br />
Sometimes that with <span class="mi">Elijah</span> he partook,<br />
Or as a guest with <a href="" id="dan" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Daniel</span></a> at his pulse.<br />
Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark<br />

Left his ground-nest, high <span class="varspell" title="towering">towring</span> to descry<span class="line" id="line280"> [ 280 ]</span><br />
The <span class="varspell" title="morn's">morns</span> approach, and greet her with his Song:<br />
As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose<br />
Our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>, and found all was <a href="" id="dream" class="annotBtn">but a dream</a>,<br />

Up to a hill anon his steps he <span class="varspell" title="reared">rear'd</span>,<span class="line" id="line285"> [ 285 ]</span><br />
From whose high top to ken the prospect round,<br />
If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd;<br />

Only in a <a href="" id="bottom" class="annotBtn">bottom</a> saw a pleasant Grove,<br />

With <span class="varspell" title="chant">chaunt</span> of tuneful Birds resounding loud;<span class="line" id="line290"> [ 290 ]</span><br />
Thither he bent his way, <span class="varspell" title="determined">determin'd</span> there<br />
To rest at noon, and <span class="varspell" title="entered">entr'd</span> soon the shade<br />

Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he <span class="varspell" title="viewed">view'd</span> it round,<br />
When suddenly a man before him stood,<br />
Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,<br />

As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred,<span class="line" id="line300"> [ 300 ]</span><br />
And with fair speech these words to him <span class="varspell" title="addressed">address'd</span>.

<p>
With granted leave officious I return,<br />

In this wild solitude so long should bide<br />

Of all things destitute, and well I know,<span class="line" id="line305"> [ 305 ]</span><br />

For therein stands the office of a <a name="justking">King</a>,<br />
His <span class="varspell" title="Honor">Honour</span>, <span class="varspell" title="Virtue">Vertue</span>, Merit and chief Praise,<br />

That for the <span class="varspell" title="Public">Publick</span> all this weight he bears.<span class="line" id="line465"> [ 465 ]</span><br />
Yet he who <a href="" id="reign" class="annotBtn">reigns within himself</a>, and rules<br />
Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King;<br />
Which every wise and <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> man attains:<br />
And who attains not, ill aspires to rule<br />

Cities of men, or head-strong Multitudes,<span class="line" id="line470"> [ 470 ]</span><br />
Subject himself to Anarchy within,<br />
Or lawless passions in him, which he serves.<br />
But to guide Nations in the way of truth<br />
By saving Doctrine, and from <span class="varspell" title="error">errour</span> lead<br />

To know, and knowing worship God aright,<span class="line" id="line475"> [ 475 ]</span><br />
Is yet more Kingly; this attracts the Soul,<br />
Governs the inner man, the nobler part,<br />
That other <span class="varspell" title="over">o're</span> the body only reigns,<br />
And oft by force, which to a generous mind<br />

So reigning can be no sincere delight.<span class="line" id="line480"> [ 480 ]</span><br />
Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought<br />
Greater and nobler done, and to <a href="" id="down" class="annotBtn">lay down</a><br />
Far more magnanimous, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to assume.<br />
Riches are needless then, both for themselves,<br />

And for thy reason why they should be sought,<span class="line" id="line485"> [ 485 ]</span><br />
To gain a Scepter, oftest better <span class="varspell" title="missed">miss't</span>.
