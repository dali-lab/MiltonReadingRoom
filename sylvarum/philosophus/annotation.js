"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. Milton titled this collection of Latin and Greek verses, \"Sylvarum,\" or \"of the woods,\" indicating the variety of metrical forms included, even a variety of languages, since two are in Greek. The metrical forms employed here include iambics, hexameters and various kinds of Horatian modes, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcaic_stanza\" target=\"main\">alcaic stanzas</a>. Milton arranged the poems in a roughly chronological order according to their dates of composition, probably to emphasize his progress as a poet from his earliest attempts to his more mature poems.</p></div></body> </html> </span>"}
