There is some argument about whether the \"vain trophies\" (or trophies of vanity) refer to all the elegies selected for publication in the 1645 <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:114721:69\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span></a>, or just to Elegy 7. Revard thinks the \"retraction\" refers only to Elegy 7 based on the fact that it is printed on the half-page immediately following that poem in the 1645 <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:114721:83\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span></a> and because it concerns the theme of cupidinous desire featured in Elegy 7.</span>",

The poet plans to abandon elegy and its more carnal versions of love and prepares to embrace the more serious erotics of Plato and <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg004.perseus-eng1:1.1\" target=\"main\">Xenophon</a>, as Milton announced in his <span class=\"booktitle\">Apology for Smectymnuus</span> (1642):</p><blockquote>Thus from the Laureat fraternity of Poets, riperyeares, and the ceaselesse round of study and reading led meto the shady spaces of philosophy, but chiefly to the divinevolumes of Plato, and his equall Xenophon. Where if I shouldtell ye what I learnt, of chastity and love, I meane that whichis truly so, whose charming cup is only vertue which she bearsin her hand to those who are worthy. The rest are cheatedwith a thick intoxicating potion which a certaine Sorceressethe abuser of loves name carries about.</blockquote></span>"}
