They had been withheld in 1673, probably because of thenotoriety of the men whom they praised – leading figures of the Civil War andCommonwealth – and because in them Milton affirmed his commitment to theCommonwealth and the pursuit of liberty.

Milton, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Williams_%28theologian%29\" target=\"main\">Roger Williams</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Vane_the_Younger\" target=\"main\">Henry Vane</a> (see <a href=\"../sonnet_17/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">Sonnet 17</a>) hoped to avoid the re-establishment of a state church, and vigorously opposed any settlement that would enforce uniform worship and suppress all heterodox Christian beliefs.  Milton himself entertained some unorthodox beliefs that conservatives were eager to outlaw.</p><p class=\"next\">The octave (first eight lines) celebrates the military and moral victories that brought Cromwell to power as the head of the army and of the Council of State. (He was soon to take on the monarchist-sounding title of Lord Protector.)  The sestet encourages Cromwell to resist efforts by conservative Presbyterians and some independents (\"new foes\") to establish state-enforced and tithe-funded religious uniformity.</span>",
