var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  Unlike the Petrarchan themes that dominate the Italian sonnets, this one takes a distinctly inward turn. The speaker sounds deliberately ambivalent about being a late-bloomer. On one hand he feels his youth has been stolen away before he has developed the \"inward ripeness\" he expects of himself. On the other hand, he professes strong confidence in \"the will of Heav\'n\" to bring his life to proper fruition in God\'s own time. The strict measure of line 10 underscores this theme and the speaker\'s conviction. Though there has been some controversy in dating this poem, Barbara Lewalski settles fairly confidently on a time \"on or shortly after his twenty-fourth birthday,\" arguing that \"Milton\'s usual way of referring to his age when dating his poems makes 1632 probable\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#barbara_lewalski\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Life of John Milton</span></a> 60).</span>",
