var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> was first published in 1671 in one volume with Milton\'s four-book epic,  <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span>. The title page read: \"<a href=\"../../pr/title/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">Paradise Regain\'d. A Poem. In IV Books. To which is added Samson Agonistes</a>.\" Because the 1671 title page might appear to treat <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> as a kind of supplement to <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span>, some early readers assumed that the two poems were composed at about the same time, or that <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson</span> was written shortly after <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span>.</p>  <p class=\"next\">William Riley Parker, in <a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#william_parker\" target=\"main\">his 1968 biography</a>, argued that Milton wrote <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson</span> in the 1640s or 1650s, citing certain metrical similarities to earlier poems and Milton\'s own marital difficulties with his first wife, Mary Powell. However, the general consensus at present is in favor of a later date of composition, after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. <a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#blair_worden\" target=\"main\">Blair Worden</a> has shown how much  the language of the drama echoes statements made by and about republicans and regicides imprisoned or exiled during the Restoration; Milton was one of those imprisoned, though briefly.</p><p class=\"next\">The 1671 edition also included a separate <a href=\"../title/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">title page</a> at the beginning of <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> that identified the piece generically as \"a Dramatic Poem.\" Milton meant the poem to be read as a tragedy but not performed on the stage.  In an essay placed just before the poem and titled, \"<a href=\"../tragedy/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call\'d Tragedy</a>,\" Milton specifically noted that <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> was never intended for the stage (see Elizabeth Sauer\'s essay, \"<a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#elizabeth_sauer\" target=\"main\">The Politics of Performance in the Inner Theater: <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> as ClosetDrama</a>\"). Citing classical tragedians&mdash;Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides&mdash;as precedents, Milton modeled his tragic dramatic poem on their works and on Aristotle\'s descriptions of tragedy in the <span class=\"booktitle\">Poetics</span>. The <a href=\"../title/text.shtml\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson</span> titlepage</a> features a quotation, in Greek and Latin translation, from chapter six of Aristotle\'s <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449b\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Poetics</span></a>, the beginning of Aristotle\'s treatment of tragedy:   \"Tragedy is, then, a representation of an action, . . . through pity and fear it effects relief to these and similar emotions\" (translated by <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449b\" target=\"main\">W. A Fyfe</a>). Milton\'s drama, however, might be said to concentrate more on representing the inner mental and emotional struggle (agon) of its hero, than on representing his actions.  The most significant outward action of the play&mdash;Samson\'s murder of the Philistine elite in Dagon\'s temple&mdash;takes place off-stage.  In his <a href=\"../tragedy/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">essay on tragedy</a>, Milton echoed Aristotle\'s phrase, \"imitation of an action,\" but with a significant change:</p><blockquote>Tragedy, as it was antiently compos\'d, hath been ever held the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems: therefore said by Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirr\'d up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated.</blockquote><p>In <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span>, Milton tried to redefine heroism as \"Patience and Heroic Martyrdom\" (<a href=\"../../pl/book_9/text.shtml#line30\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> 9.32</a>); Samson\'s tragic heroism is similarly an inward sort.  Whether or not his outward action counts as heroic depends upon how we evaluate the \"rouzing motions\" that prompt it (<a href=\"text.shtml#line1380\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson</span> 1382</a>).</p><p class=\"next\">The story that underlies Milton\'s plot in <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson</span> comes from the Biblical book of <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=JUDG+14&amp;language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on\" target=\"main\">Judges, chapters 13-16</a>.  Milton added characters to the biblical story (Harapha the arrogant carpet-knight giant and the Publick Officer), ignored some (Samson\'s mother), inflated others (Samson\'s father), but the most significant change was to make Dalila Samson\'s legally wedded wife.  <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=JUDG%2B16&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on&amp;language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;x=16&amp;y=9\" target=\"main\">Judges 16:4</a> describes Delilah as a Philistine woman \"from the valley of Soreck\"  whom Samson \"loved\" sometime after having gone \"in unto\" a \"harlot\" in Gaza (16:1). Flavius Josephus, in his <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.275\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Jewish Antiquities</span> 5</a>:306 writes the following: \"[Samson] at length transgressed the laws of his country, and altered his own regular way of living, and imitated the strange customs of foreigners, which thing was the beginning of his miseries; for he fell in love with a woman that was a harlot among the Philistines: her name was Delilah, and he lived with her.\" <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span>  refers once to Delilah as a harlot (<a href=\"../../pl/book_9/text.shtml#line1060\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> 9.1060</a>).  In this poem, however, Milton re-casts Dalila as Samson\'s \"Traytress\" wife, perhaps the most perfect example in every particular of the \"unfit and mistak\'n wife\"  Milton described in his <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#unfitwife\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span></a> of 1644. (Search the text for \"unfit\" to find many more examples.)  It may be helpful to regard Samson as achieving a sort of heroism Adam could not: Samson divorces his unfit wife.</p><p class=\"next\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Milton Reading Room</span> text of both these poems was prepared from the 1671 edition as found in the Rauner Special Collections of the Dartmouth College Library (Val. 824/M64/U612).

"ball":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>tender ball.</i>  Though my first Milton teacher, Barbara Lewalski, told me she thinks the idea perverse, I cannot help hearing Samson here express some anxiety about the fragility of masculinity, as well as of the sense of sight.  In any case, loss of manhood is all of a piece here with loss of sight, power, and apparently, God\'s other special gifts.</span>",
"sense":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>not as feeling.</i>  That is, not like the sense of touch.  Both Aristotle and Augustine revered the sense of sight as the most noble of the senses and that of touch as the least.  Samson laments that the least noble sense is diffused throughout the body and sight confined to a fragile \"tender ball.\"</span>",
"self":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>My self my Sepulcher.</i>  This implies the  Puritan notion of the self (as body) as the tomb or \"living death\" of the self (as soul).  Samson echoes Paul\'s reference to the \"body of this death\" in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Romans+7&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Romans 7:</a> 24.  The line also tends to echo Satan\'s acknowledgement in <a href=\"../../pl/book_4/text.shtml#selfhell\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> 4.75:</a>  \"Myself am Hell.\"  In addition, this line can be compared to Adam dreading \"a living death\" in <a href=\"../../pl/book_10/text.shtml#livingdeath\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> 10.788.</a></p><p>  </span>",
"obnoxious":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>obnoxious.</i>  Exposed to every harm.</span>",
"inhuman":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>inhuman foes.</i>  The Philistines are not, of course, inhuman.  Perhaps we should understand the word as \"inhumane,\" but it is more likely that Milton portrays Samson as one who thinks of the Philistines as less than human.  Whether or not Milton shares Samson\'s racist attitude is a matter for debate.</span>",
"chorus":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Chor.</i>  The Chrous.  Milton follows the classical practice of using a chorus as a kind of commentator on the drama as it unfolds.  Sophocles used a chorus in his tragedies: see Sophocles\' <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg003.perseus-eng1:134\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Ajax</span></a>.  The practice was uncommon in early modern tragedy.

"lanquish":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Lines 118-119.</i> These lines echo Ovid\'s description of Hermaphroditus in  <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng2:4.373\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span></a> 4.373.</span>",

"high":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>high estate.</i> According to Aristotle\'s definition of tragedy, its protagonist must be one of high estate, noble by birth (<a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg034.perseus-eng1:1453a\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Poetics</span> 1453a</a>).  Milton redefines \"high estate\" as a matter of virtue rather than of birth.
