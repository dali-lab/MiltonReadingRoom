var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  This epitaph commemorates thedeath of Jane Paulet, the Marchioness (the wife of the Marquis) of Winchester.  She died on April 15,1631 giving birth to a son, who also perished.  She was twenty-three years old.  At the time ofher death, Milton was twenty-two and a student atCambridge.  This poem was written some time shortly after Jane Paulet\'s death, and first published in1645.  The copytext is from the <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/114721/16\" target=\"main\">1645 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span></a>.\"An Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester\" iscomposed of rhyming couplets  of iambic tetrameter.  This rhythm and meter owes much to Ben Jonson.For an example of this, see a sampling of Ben Jonson\'s poetry, especially <ahref=\"http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/jonson/elizabeth.htm\" target=\"main\">\"Epitaph on Elizabeth, L.H.\"</a> whichevokes a sentiment very similar to Milton\'s  here.  Another well known Elizabethan epitaph is Claudio\'s epitaph on Hero  in Shakespeare\'s <ahref=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Shakespeare/much_ado/much_ado.5.3.html\"target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Much Ado About Nothing</span> 5.3.3-20</a>.  Although Claudio\'s motives to lamentdiffer from Milton\'s, both share the samerhythm and meter. </span>",
