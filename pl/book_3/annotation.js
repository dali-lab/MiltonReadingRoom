"myword":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>My word, my wisdom, and effectual might</i>.  The Son is here defined as the sole agent of God, the outward expression in word, wisdom, and might of an otherwise invisible (see line 375 and <a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#invisible\" target=\"main\">5. 157</a>), ineffable God.</span>",

"complacence":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>complacence</i>. Pleasure or source of pleasure.</span>",
"hand":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>right Hand</i>.  Christ sits at the right hand of God.  A sign of utmost respect, and simultaneously one of slight inferiority.  Milton held the unorthodox view that the Son was not coeternal with the Father, but was begotten by the Father at a particular moment before creation.</span>",
"flesh":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Made flesh</i>.  Echoes <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=John+1&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">John 1</a>: 14: \"The Word was made flesh.\"</span>",

"equality":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Equal to God</i>. The phrase here modifies \"bliss,\" implying that the Son in heaven enjoys bliss equal to that enjoyed by God, but not necessarily general equality of the Son to God. Though, Milton might have invited a misreading here from more orthodox readers. We should probably understand the use of the word \"unequals\" in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#equal\" target=\"main\">8.383</a> with a similar latitude.</span>",
"merit":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>merit</i>.  Milton presents the Son as Son of God more by virtue of his deeds than by virtue of his begetting.  Satan plays a parody of such merit in <a href=\"../book_2/text.shtml#merit\" target=\"main\">2.5</a>.</span>",
"manhood":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>thy Manhood also</i>.  That is, by virtue of dying for men as a mortal, the Son\'s \"manhood,\" his incarnate self, will be advanced to a heavenly throne every bit as much as his godhood already is.  The term \"manhood\" appears gender specific, as if salvation were principally a manly experience, and only by extension intended for women.</span>",
