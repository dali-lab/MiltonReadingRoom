This collection commemorated the death of Edward King,a collegemate of Milton\'s at Cambridge who drowned when his ship sank off the coast of Wales inAugust, 1637.  Milton volunteered or was asked to make a contribution to the collection.  The presentedition follows the copy of <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/114721/33\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Poems of Mr. John Milton</span></a> (1645) in the Rauner Collection atDartmouth College known as Hickmott 172. Milton made a few significant revisions to <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span>after 1638.  These revisions are noted as they occur.</p><p><span class=\"note\">Form and Structure.</span>  The structure of <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> remains somewhat mysterious.  <a href=\"../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#martin_evans\" target=\"main\">J. Martin Evans</a> argues that there are two movements with six sections each thatseem to mirror each other.  Arthur Barker believes that the body of <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> is composed ofthree movements that run parallel in pattern.  That is, each movement begins with an invocation, thenexplores the conventions of the pastoral, and ends with a conclusion to Milton\'s \"emotional problem\"(quoted in <a href=\"../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#mark_womack\" target=\"main\">Womack</a>).  </p><p><span class=\"note\">Voice.</span>  Milton\'s epigram labels <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span>  a \"monody\": a lyrical lament for one voice.  Butthe poem has several voices or personae, including the \"uncouth swain\" (the main narrator), who is\"interrupted\" first by Phoebus (Apollo), then Camus (the river Cam, and thus Cambridge University personified), and the \"Pilot ofthe Galilean lake\" (St. Peter).  Finally, a second narrator appears  for only the last eight lines tobring a conclusion in ottava rima (see <a href=\"../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#f_prince\" target=\"main\">F. T. Prince</a>). Before the second narrator enters, the poem contains the irregular rhyme and meter characteristic ofthe Italian canzone form.  Canzone is essentially a polyphonic lyrical form, hence creating a seriousconflict with the \"monody.\"  Milton may have meant \"monody\" in the sense that thepoem should be regarded more as a story told completely by one person as opposed to a chorus.  Thisperson would presumably be the final narrator, who seemingly masks himself as the \"uncouth swain.\" This concept of story-telling ties <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> closer to the genre of pastoral elegy.</p><p><span class=\"note\">Genre.</span> <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> is a pastoral elegy, a genre initiated by Theocritus, also put to famous use by Virgil and Spenser. <a href=\"../bibliography/i-k/text.shtml#christopher_kendrick\" target=\"main\">Christopher Kendrick</a> asserts that one\'s reading of<span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> would be improved by treating the poem anachronistically, that is, as if it was one ofthe most original pastoral elegies.  Also, as already stated, it employs the irregular rhyme and meter ofan Italian canzone.   <a href=\"../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#stella_revard\" target=\"main\">Stella Revard</a> suggests that <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span> also exhibitsthe influence of  Pindaric odes, especially in its allusions  to Orpheus, Alpheus, and Arethusa. The poem\'s arrangement in verse paragraphs and its introduction of various voices and personae are also features that anticipate epic structures.   Likethe form, structure, and voice of <span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas,</span> its genre is deeply complex.  <span class=\"author\">James Sitar</span></span>",
