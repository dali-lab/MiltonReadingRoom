In the<a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#conversation\" target=\"main\"> <span class=\"booktitle\">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span></a>, Milton tries to redefine marriage as principally a relationship based on a man\'s \"rational\" desire for conversation rather than passionate desire for sex or for procreation, though, of course, sex remains a secondary aspect of marriage.  Adam\'s responses to conversation with Raphael indicate Adam\'s erotic pleasure  in discourse with an angel.  Does he get more conversational pleasure from the angel than from Eve?

"thirst":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>thirst</i>.  Although a common enough metaphor for intellectual desire even in Milton\'s day,  it also reminds us of Raphael\'s earlier warnings about intellectual temperance and the analogy between bodily desires (sex,food, and drink) and intellectual desire (<a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#temperance\" target=\"main\">7.126-130 </a>).  This analogy is explicitly denied any argumentative force by Aristotle in his <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg010.perseus-eng1:1117b\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Nicomachean Ethics</span> 1117b</a>.</span>",

Eve, we are invited to imagine, has sat close by (\"in sight\"), but a little ways away (\"retir\'d\") from Adam and Raphael throughout this conversation which began in book 5.  Only now, does she move out of sight and hearing altogether.</span>",
"won":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>that won who saw</i>.  This phrase complicates interpretation of the entire book.  If Eve\'s grace is such that whoever saw her rise from her seat would naturally  wish her to stay, then we are tempted to conclude that neither Adam nor Raphael sees her rise and depart, for neither of them expresses any wish to have her stay.  The only way around this conclusion is to think that Adam sees her rise and wishes her to stay, but says nothing, never expresses his desire in word or gesture.  Lines 62-63 repeat this observation about the power of Eve\'s \"Winning Graces.\"  Again, the likely interpretation is that Adam does not see Eve leave, or he would have expressed his desire for her to stay.  See <a href=\"../../graphics/blake/PL05.shtml\" target=\"main\">William Blake\'s illustration</a> of the relevant lines of sight during the dinner scene.</span>",
"conjugal":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>conjugal Caresses</i>.  That is to say, Eve prefers to hear of these things directly from Adam rather than from the angel because, unlike the angel, Adam will intermix with his rhetoric \"conjugal caresses\" and kisses, and so settle difficult concepts with the power of sensual touch.  Does this mean that Eve prefers discourse that includes sensual elements over purely rational discourse?  Is her desire the \"rational desire\" Milton describes as the prime reason for marriage (see <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#rationalburning\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span></a>)?</span>",

"starrs":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>other Starrs</i>.  Read in conjunction with \"their wandring course\" (line 126), we must understand \"Starrs\" here as referring to planets.  The word planet derives from the Greek word for \"wanderer.\"  In <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.03.0010&amp;query=scene%3D%235&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Doctor Faustus</span></a>,  Mephistophiles refers to the literal meaning of the word \"planet\" by calling Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter \"erring starres.\"</span>",

"line126":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>In six thou seest</i>. That is, the six planets other than the sun, known in Milton\'s day. Seventeenth-century astronomical terminology differs significantly from our own usage. Any heavenly body was referred to as a \"star,\" including the moon, stars and planets. The word, \"planet,\" which means \"wanderer,\" was reserved for those stars that appeared to move across the sky; the others were called fixed stars. From a Ptolemaic perspective, then, the sun was considered a planet, but the earth was not. Seven planets leant their names to the seven days of the week. (No Earth day then!) So the \"six\" to which Raphael refers are the moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. In this conversation, the Sun\'s status as a planet, a wandering star, is at issue, so Raphael concerns himself with the other \"six.\"</span>",
"planetearth":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Planet Earth</i>. Modern readers will have some difficulty registering just how odd an idea it was in Milton\'s day to refer to Earth as a planet. In the Ptolemaic model of the cosmos, earth was the fixed center, the fixed stars formed the outer shells of the cosmos and the planets were those \"stars\" that wandered. Though Raphael refuses to settle the issue of Earth\'s status, by naming it Planet Earth, he sends to Milton\'s readers, though not to Adam, a strong signal endorsing Copernicus and Galileo.</span>",

"suttly":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>suttly to detaine thee</i>.  Is Adam being a little coy here, suggesting that the chief reason he offers to tell his story is to keep Raphael nearby and hear him speak again?  Why is he so eager to extend Raphael\'s visit, but never seemed to notice when Eve rose to leave?  Is conversation with Raphael more pleasurable than conversation with Eve?

"line213":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>from labour</i>.   After labor.</span>",

For Adam, one distinction between eating and learning (explicitly compared in <a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#temperance\" target=\"main\"> 7.126-130</a>) is that desire for learning, and in this case conversation with Raphael, is never sated.  Should we suppose that Adam\'s desire for conversation with Eve (lines <a href=\"text.shtml#caresses\" target=\"main\">52-57</a> above) is similarly insatiable?

May we suppose that Adam, since he \"taught\" Eve the lesson about the true fairness of manly grace and wisdom, has erred a bit in his esthetic judgment, led astray, perhaps, by the subsequent sensuality of his relationship with Eve (see below, lines 530-559).</span>",
