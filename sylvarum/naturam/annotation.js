"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. Milton titled this collection of Latin and Greek verses, \"Sylvarum,\" or \"of the woods,\" indicating the variety of metrical forms included, even a variety of languages, since two are in Greek. The metrical forms employed here include iambics, hexameters and various kinds of Horatian modes, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcaic_stanza\" target=\"main\">alcaic stanzas</a>. Milton arranged the poems in a roughly chronological order according to their dates of composition, probably to emphasize his progress as a poet from his earliest attempts to his more mature poems.</p><p class=\"next\">On July 2, 1628, Milton wrote to Alexander Gill, his former tutor and enclosed with his letter a printed copy of a poem he composed for an \"Academic Assembly.\"  This was probably Cambridge\'s commencement exercise held on July 1 that year.  Milton wrote: \"by chance a certain Fellow of our House, who was going to act as Respondent in the Philosophical Disputation at this Academic Assembly, entrusted to my Puerility the Verses which annual custom requires to be written on the questions, he himself being long past light-minded nonsense of that kind and more intent on serious things\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#yale\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Complete Prose Works</span></a> 1.314).
