But in <span class=\"booktitle\">Theogony</span>, thecave is in the underworld and follows the description of the battle. </span>",
"mornher":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>her</i>.  The \"Morn\" is here gendered feminine.

"isolation":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>one/ Return\'d not lost</i>.   Milton\'s emphasis on theimportance of one righteous individual surrounded by wickedness is supported bymany biblical passages,  from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah (<ahref=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+18&amp;version=KJV\"target=\"main\">Genesis 18</a>: 20-19) to Moses (in Exodus), and culminating in thelife of Jesus.  Milton also may have regarded himself as one just man surrounded by evildoers,since often he  had to defend his religious convictions to those in power, and onthe issue of divorce he was virtually alone among his English contemporaries. </span>",

"welldone":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Servant of God, well done</i>.  This is addressed toAbdiel whose name literally means \"servant of God.\"  The phrase also echoes thewords of the master to the faithful servants in Jesus\' parable of the talents (<ahref=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Matthew+25&amp;version=KJV\"target=\"main\">Matthew 25</a>: 21).

"Sons":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>my Sons</i>.  All angels, as all men are God\'s sons.  No angels, in Milton\'s writings, are female.

Milton\'s angels resemble in some waysthe biblical descriptions of the church militant in  <ahref=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Ephesians+6&amp;version=KJV\"target=\"main\">Ephesians 6</a>.  Homer\'s and Virgil\'s epic heroes were also armedor protected by gods.  By alluding to the biblical armor of God, however, Miltonsuggests that the angels\' armor was spiritual. </span>",
"equalnumber":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Equal in number</i>.

"charglo":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Sun-bright chariot</i>.  Satan\'s chariot is bright, butit does not burn with the \"thick flames\" (see lines 750-1) of the Son\'sdivine chariot.  Although Satan\'s chariot is impressive, it will pale incomparison to the Son\'s.</span>",

"resemblance":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>resemblance of the Highest</i>.   Abdielacknowledges that  Satan retains some celestial beauty, despite his rebel nature.Since Raphael tells this story to Adam in the form of a warning, he may becautioning Adam not to admire beauty overmuch, as he later advises Adam to be wary ofattributing overmuch to Eve\'s beauty  (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#self_esteem\"target=\"main\"> 8.565-570</a>). Satan\'s sin  affects his appearance, especiallyafter he has fallen to Hell.

"stars":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>jarring Sphears (lines 310-15)</i>.

Such a conflict would be amicrocosm of the battle Raphael describes. </span>",
"norepeat":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>not of power</i>.  A difficult sentence.  Bothcombatants (each one degree removed from \"almighty\") aimed one stroke each as ifthey meant only to strike once and determine the matter by that single stroke. Toexpect to repeat such a stroke would be nonsense, for that would indicate thefirst stroke was \"not of power\" to do the job.  Some types of martial training aimed to teachsoldiers to prevail with a single stroke. </span>",
"appeerd":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>odds appeerd</i>.  That is, there appeared no evidencethat either the mighty stroke (Michael\'s attack) or its \"swift prevention\"(Satan\'s parry) would prevail. </span>",

"Raphael":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Raphael</i>.   Raphael speaks of himself in the thirdperson; he has not introduced himself to Adam by name, nor does he ever.

"Adramelec":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Adramelec</i>.   Adramelec, the \"mighty King,\" was alocal version of the Babylonian sun god.  <ahref=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=2+Kings+17&amp;version=KJV\"target=\"main\">2 Kings 17</a>:31 says that children were burned on his altar.Throughout, Milton uses the names of foreign gods from past ages to signify thefalse godhood of the rebellious angels. </span>",

Another Arioch appears as aBabylonian captain in <ahref=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Daniel+2&amp;version=KJV\"target=\"main\">Daniel 2</a>: 14.

"Libertie":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Libertie alone</i>.  Satan may serve here to satirize Oliver Cromwellas one for whom liberty alone was \"too mean\" a cause for struggle, but also soughtworldly \"Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne.\"  The Commonwealth proclaimed following the execution of Charles I in 1649 effectively became a <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=63157\" target=\"main\">Protectorate</a> in 1654 when Cromwell assumed the title Lord Protector.</span>",

"spume":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>spiritous and fierie spume</i>.   The phrase representssulfur and nitre, which in Milton\'s time, were thought to play a role in thecreation of other matter.   This would make them volatile in their creativity, akind of gunpowder, somewhat like God\'s thunder is linked to His creativitythrough his control over matter. </span>",
"hallow":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>hallow</i>.  Hollow. </span>",
"strength":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>The Thunderer</i>.  Satan uses Zeus\'s epithet fromHesiod\'s <ahref=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:29\"target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Theogony</span></a> to speak of God. </span>",

"substance":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Mineral and Stone</i>.   The rebel angels dig up\"crude\" materials and form cannons from them.

By introducing theelements to the battle as weapons, putting them in their chaotic roles ratherthen the subservient roles of order created by God, Satan further imposes Chaoson Heaven (<a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#schwartz\"target=\"main\">Schwartz</a> 27). </span>",

"scoffing":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>scoffing</i>.   Insults were commonplace in epicbattles of the <span class=\"booktitle\">Iliad</span> and the <span class=\"booktitle\">Aeneid</span>, but it is notable that thesinless angels do not participate in them, and are not concerned with their ownhonor; thus, they have no need to return scorn for scorn. </span>",
"pluckt":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>pluckt the seated Hills</i>.
