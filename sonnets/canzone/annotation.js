var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  A canzone is a traditional Italian form with three movements.  The form influenced Spenser\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Epithalimion</span> as well as Milton\'s <a href=\"../../lycidas/text.shtml\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Lycidas</span></a>.  This poem is a brief, loosely-structured canzone.  As with <a href=\"../sonnet_3/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"Sonnet 3\"</a>, Milton uses an Italian form to express the difficulty of writing in Italian, yet Milton has undertaken an especially daunting task by choosing to write in the complicated canzone form.  Unlike his previous experience with English and Latin verse, the poet writes this difficult poem in Italian because, as the lady explains to him, \"This is the language in which Love delights.\"</span>",
"rivi":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>other shores...rivers (altri rivi...altri lidi).</i>  The \"altri rivi\" represent Latin and English composition. </span>",
"soverchiasoma":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>soverchia soma.</i>  While the <span class=\"booktitle\">altri rivi</span> represent Latin and English composition,  <span class=\"booktitle\">soverchia soma</span> refers to the difficulty of writing verse in Italian.  Milton also figures languages as rivers in <a href=\"../sonnet_3/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"Sonnet 3,\" line 10</a>.</span>",
"canzone":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Speak Muse! (Canzon dirotti).</i>  Milton\'s address to the muse signals the beginning of the envoy (<span class=\"booktitle\">commiato</span>), the final movement in a canzone in which the poet addresses the poem.
