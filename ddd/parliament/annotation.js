var annotList = {"Assembly":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  This tract, first published a year earlier and now (1644) in a much expanded form, is addressed to the Assembly of Divines as well as to Parliament.  The Assembly was dominated by Presbyterians, Milton\'s partners in the rhetorical and political battle against prelacy, but these same Presbyterian divines had not received his <I>Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</I> with favor.  Some of them accused Milton of advocating \"divorce at pleasure\" and debauchery.  Even while Presbyterians were harshly criticizing him from pulpits all over London, Milton still held out hope of persuading them to his case.  He mostly failed to do so.<P></span>",
"Parlament":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Milton\'s preferred spelling throughout the pamphlet.<P></span>",
"Custome":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Arguments against the power of custom in religious and public affairs were commonplace in Protestant and Puritan polemic of the 16th and 17th centuries.  Against Roman Catholic appeals to custom and tradition, Puritans typically insisted upon what they considered plain evidence from scripture.<P></span>",

"Ezekiel":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Milton refers to the vision recorded in <A HREF=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&version=KJV&passage=Ezekiel+2\" TARGET=\"main\">Ezekiel 2</a> and <A HREF=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&version=KJV&passage=Ezekiel+3\" TARGET=\"main\">3</a>.  Milton personifies \"Custome\" as a deceitful instructor, and as feminine.<P></span>",

"ends":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  That is, one\'s own personal goals masked as civic or social goals.  Milton, in fact, was prompted to his concern for divorce, and the authoring of four tracts about it, by the departure of Mary Powell, his first wife.  She returned to her father\'s house only a few weeks after her marriage to John Milton.<P></span>",

"indulgences":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Milton alludes sneeringly to Papal indulgences and dispensations, often granted to wealthy patrons of the church as were marriage anullments.  Luther and other reformers made much of such abuses in their initial reformist zeal against the Roman Catholic Church.  See Luther\'s <A HREF=\"http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/web/ninetyfive.html\" TARGET=\"main\"><I>Disputation on Indulgences </I></a>(1517).<P></span>",
"Colony":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Milton refers to the Israelites here with a very odd euphemism.  <A HREF=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&version=KJV&passage=Matthew+19\" TARGET=\"main\">Matthew 19:</a>8 and <A HREF=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&version=KJV&passage=Mark+10\" TARGET=\"main\">Mark 10:</a>5 cites their \"hardness of heart\" as the reason for allowing divorce in the first place.<P></span>",
"from":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  In the Rauner library copy from which this edition was prepared, \"rom\" has been corrected in ink in a fair hand to \"from.\"<P></span>",

Milton quotes from <A HREF=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&version=KJV&passage=Romans+13\" TARGET=\"main\">Romans 13:</a>10, but also alludes to Jesus\'s summary of the Law in <A HREF=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&version=KJV&passage=Mathew+22\" TARGET=\"main\">Matthew 22:</a>37-40.<P></span>",
"foure":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  That is, reason, charity, nature, and good example.  Milton makes in brief two very important political points here.  First, that tyrants may be resisted even though Scripture does not explicitly say so.  Second, that no oath, nor any political institution for that matter, has legitimate power and authority contrary to the ends for which it was administered or instituted.<P></span>",
"Confessor":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Edward the Confessor (1002-1066), the last of the Saxon kings before the Norman invasion.  He was remembered as a model of piety and justice.<P></span>",
"quotationists":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Expositors who rely on literal readings of small bits of scripture lifted out of contexts.<P></span>",
"dependencies":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Following the disestablishment of bishops, Parliament argued without successful conclusion about the re-organization of the Church in England.  The chief opponents were the Presbyterians, favoring a state church overseen by presbyters and laymen elected to sessions and natioanl assemblies, versus the independents who would have no established state church authority, but every congregation independent.  \"In what Calends\" means \"when.\"<P></span>",
"out":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  In the Rauner library copy from which this edition was prepared, the phrase reads \"Doubt not to reach out to your steddy hands\";  I have removed what appears to be a supernumerary \"to.\"<P></span>",

"Masoreth":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  From a Hebrew word usually understood as meaning \"tradition,\" a masorah or masoreth was a body of notations compiled by rabbis to help preserve what they determined to be the correct form of the Torah.  Milton\'s point is that Jesus is the most authoritative rabbi and commentator on the Torah.<P></span>",
"Ezra":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i> The \"Great Synagogue,\" an assembly of 120 teachers and scholars in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (5th C BCE) who desired to se limits and guidelines to interpretation of the Torah.

"Alcuin":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Alcuin (735-804) was born and educated at York; he played a large part in the revival of learning at the court of Charlemagne.  John Wycliffe (1320-1384), one of the earliest forerunners of the reformation, translated the New Testament into English and spawned a reformist following in England and abroad.<P></span>",
"defenders":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  Henry the 8th, before he broke with Rome, was awarded the title, \"Defender of the Faith\" by Pope Leo X in 1521 largely as a result of his (probably Thomas More\'s) pamphlet attacking Martin Luther.  Henry and all English monarchs since have retained the title.<P></span>",
