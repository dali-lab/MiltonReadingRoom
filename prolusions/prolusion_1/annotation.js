Seven university exercises in oratory, or prolusions, composed by John Milton  while a student at Christ\'s College, Cambridge, were originally published in 1674 by the bookseller Brabazon Aylmer in a volume entitled <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:55153:33\" id=\"Prolusions_1674\" name=\"Prolusions_1674\" title=\"Prolusions_1674\" target=\"main\"><i>Epistolarum Familiarium Liber Unus: Quibus Accesserunt, Eiusdem, jam olim in Collegio Adolescentis, Prolusiones Quaedam Oratoriae</i></a>. Originally Aylmer wanted to collect in one volume Milton\'s personal letters and the letters of state he wrote as Secretary for Foreign Tongues (1650-58), but he could not get permission to publish the latter, so he included the seven prolusions instead. The substitution was probably Milton\'s own idea.</p><p>Prolusion exercises were held by universities in advance of holiday vacations or commencement exercises, so they have both an academic and a ludic flavor. As academic orations, they were composed and delivered in Latin. The topics, which may appear to us to be challengingly trivial, were assigned by professors and tutors. The point was not so much to argue the correct side, but to argue either side better than your opponents, as with debating societies today. In this first prolusion Milton has been assigned the \"Day\" side in the question \"Whether Day or Night is the More Excellent.\" Milton makes serious arguments with a very light though learned touch.</p><p>The translation here closely follows that of Phyllis B. Tillyard in the <a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#yale\" id=\"Yaleprose\" name=\"Yaleprose\" title=\"Yaleprose\" target=\"main\">Yale edition of Milton\'s prose</a>.</span>",
"polydamas":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Polydamas.</i> Attius Labeo appears as a kind of byword for a poor \"scribbler\" in Persius\'s <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/satirespersius00wollgoog#page/n29/mode/2up\" id=\"PersiusSatires\" name=\"PersiusSatires\" title=\"PersiusSatires\" target=\"main\">first Satire</a>. The narrator jokes that the \"Trojan crew/Led by Polydamas\" may be misled to prefer \"A scribbling Labeo\" to himself. Labeo is said to have attempted a translation of Homer\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Iliad</span> in the first century.</span>",

"speechifiers":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>these speechifiers.</i> Young Milton makes bold here to insult his fellow students. Some of this may be ascribed to the kind of playful tone expected of academic exercises, but we know from a letter he wrote to Alexander Gill in July 1628 that he held most of his Christ\'s College peers (and even some of their masters) in relative contempt: \"There is really hardly anyone among us, as far as I know, who, almost completely unskilled and unlearned in Philology and Philosophy alike, does not flutter off to Theology unfledged, quite content to touch that also most lightly, learning barely enough for sticking together a short harangue by any method whatever and patching it with worn-out pieces from various sources&mdash;a practice carried far enough to make one fear that the priestly Ignorance of a former age may gradually attack our Clergy\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#yale\" id=\"yaleprose\" name=\"yaleprose\" title=\"yaleprose\" target=\"main\">Yale prose</a>, volume 1, 314).</span>",
