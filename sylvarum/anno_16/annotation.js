"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. Milton titled this collection of Latin and Greek verses, \"Sylvarum,\" or \"of the woods, indicating the variety of metrical forms included, even a variety of languages, since two are in Greek. The metrical forms employed here include iambics, hexameters and various kinds of Horatian modes, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcaic_stanza\" target=\"main\">alcaic stanzas</a>. Milton arranged the poems in a roughly chronological order according to their dates of composition, probably to emphasize his progress as a poet from his earliest attempts to his more mature poems.</p><p class=\"next\">The first is an obsequy for the death of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gostlin\" target=\"main\">Dr. John Gostlin</a>, master of Caius College, Cambridge and Regius Professor of Medicine. The poet claims he wrote the poem when he was sixteen years old but Dr. Gostlin died on October 21, 1626 when Milton was less than two months shy of his eighteenth birthday. Leo Miller, in \"<a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#leo_miller\" target=\"main\">Dating Milton\'s 1626 Obituaries</a>,\" suggests that the first twenty lines and the last four could indeed have been composed before Gostlin\'s death and then put to use later for this poem. Only lines 21-44 refer directly to Gostlin.</p><p class=\"next\">The translation follows that of <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mackellar_latin\" target=\"main\">Walter MacKellar</a> with a few changes based on consulting <a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#columbia_milton\" target=\"main\">The Columbia Milton</a> and <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Merritt Y.
