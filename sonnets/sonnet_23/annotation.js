"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i>  Though some critics assert that the subject of the sonnet, the \"late espoused Saint,\" is Milton\'s first wife Mary Powell, others argue for his second wife Katherine Woodcock. A third group believes that the poem refers to an ideal or heavenly vision of woman (<a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Hughes</a>, 170-71). Milton married Katherine Woodcock on November 12, 1656 after four years as a widower. She bore their daughter, Katherine, on October 19, 1657. His new wife died only a few months later on February 3, 1658. The poem\'s reference to being washed from \"child-bed taint\" appears to point to Katherine Woodcock as the subject of this poem. Because daughter Katherine died about five weeks later, it is natural to suppose that Katherine experienced severe complications surrounding the birth of her only child.</span>",
