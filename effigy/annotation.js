var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i>  These lines first appeared in the <a href=\"../1645_title/frontispiece.shtml\" target=\"main\">frontispiece</a> for the 1645 edition of Milton\'s <i>Poems.</i>  Because I have not yet found a suitable Greek font for this edition, I have simply supplied the lines in facsimile from the 1645 edition\'s frontispiece. In 1673 the lines appeared under the title \"In Effigei Ejus Sculptorem\" just before \"Ad Salsillum\" on <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/60223/123\" target=\"main\">page 71</a>; several diacritical and breath marks are different in 1673 than what was printed on the frontispiece in 1645.  <a href=\"../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#parker\" target=\"main\">William Riley Parker</a> (289) says that Humphrey Moseley, Milton\'s printer, insisted Milton commission an engraved likeness for the frontispiece and Milton placed himself at the mercy of William Marshall.  Marshall\'s engraving, as one can readily see, is appalling; it makes Milton\'s right eye appear swollen, his hair stringy,  his nose enormous, and his lips puckered.  Instead of refusing to use the portrait, Milton had Marshall engrave these Greek lines under the portrait.  Presumably, Marshall could not read Greek.  The lines here are based on those reprinted in the text of <i>Poems</i> (1673).</p></div></body> </html> </span>"}
