I.  <i>When a man hath taken a Wife, and married her, 
and it come to pass that she find no favour in his 
eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in 
her, then let him write her a bill of divorcement, 
and give it in her hand, and send her out of his 
house</i>.<br><img

That which is the only discommodity of speaking in a 
clear matter, the abundance of argument that 
presses to be utter'd, and the suspense of judgment 
what to choose, and how in the multitude of reason 
to be not tedious, is the greatest difficulty which I 
expect here to meet with.  Yet much hath bin said 
formerly concerning this Law in the <i>Doctrine of 
Divorce</i>.  Wherof I shall repeat no more than what is 
necessary.  Two things are here doubted: First, and 
that but of late, whether this be a Law or no; next, 
what this <i>reason of uncleanness</i> might mean, for 
which the Law is granted.  That it is a plain Law no 
man ever question'd, till <i>Vatablus</i> within these 
hundred years profess'd Hebrew at Paris, a man of 
no Religion, as <i>Beza</i> deciphers him.  Yet some there 
be who follow him, not only against the current of all 
Antiquity both Jewish and Christian, but the 
evidence of Scripture also, <i>Malach</i>. 2. 16. <i> Let him 
who hateth put away, saith the Lord God of Israel</i>.  
Altho' this place also hath bin tamper'd with, as if it 
were to be thus render'd, <i>The Lord God saith, that he 
hateth putting away</i>.  But this new interpretation 
rests only in the Authority of <i>Junius</i>; for neither 
<i>Calvin</i>, nor <i>Vatablus</i> himself, nor any other known 
Divine so interpreted before.  And they of best note 
who have translated the Scripture since, and <i>Diodati</i> 
for one, follow not his reading.  And perhaps they 
might reject it, if for nothing else, for these two 
Reasons: First, it introduces in a new manner the 
person of God speaking less Majestic than he is ever 
wont: When God speaks by his Prophet, he ever 
speaks in the first person, therby signifying his 
Majesty and Omnipresence.  He would have said, <i>I 
hate puttting away, saith the Lord</i>; and not sent 
word by <i>Malachi</i> in a sudden fallen stile, <i>The Lord God 
saith that he hateth putting away</i>: that were the 
phrase to shrink the glorious Omnipresence of God 
speaking, into a kind of circumscriptive absence.  And 
were as if a Herald in the Achievement of a King, 
should commit the indecorum to set his helmet 
sideways and close, not full-faced and open in the 
posture of direction and command.  We cannot think 
therfore that this last Prophet would thus in a new 
fashion absent the person of God from his own words, 
as if he came not along with them.  For it would also 
be wide from the proper scope of his place: he that 
reads attentively will soon perceive, that God blames 
not here the Jews for putting away their wives, but 
for keeping strange Concubines, to the profaning of 
<i>Judah</i>'s holiness, and the vexation of their Hebrew 
wives, v. 11, and 14.  <i>Judah hath married the 
daughter of a strange God</i>: And exhorts them rather 
to put their wives away whom they hate, as the Law 
permitted, than to keep them under such affronts.  
And it is receiv'd that this Prophet liv'd in those 
times of <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i> (nay by some is thought 
to be <i>Ezra</i> himself) when the People were forc'd by 
these two Worthies to put their strange wives away.  
So that what the story of those times, and the plain 
context of the 11 verse, from whence this rebuke 
begins, can give us to conjecture of the obscure and 
curt Ebraisms that follow, this Prophet does not 
forbid putting away, but forbids keeping, and 
commands putting away according to God's Law, 
which is the plainest Interpreter both of what God 
will, and what he can best suffer.  Thus much evinces 
that God there commanded Divorce by <i>Malachi</i>, and 
this confirms that he commands it also here by 
<i>Moses</i>.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	I may the less doubt to mention by the way an 
Author, tho' counted Apocryphal, yet of no small 
account for Piety and Wisdom, the Author of  
<i>Ecclesiasticus</i>.  Which Book, begun by the Grand-
father of that <i>Jesus</i> who is call'd the Son of <i>Sirach</i>, 
might have bin written in part, not much after the 
time when <i>Malachi</i> liv'd; if we compute by the Reign 
of <i>Ptolemaeus Euergetes</i>.  It professes to explain the 
Law and the Prophets; and yet exhorts us to Divorce 
for incurable causes, and to cut off from the flesh 
those whom it there describes, <i>Ecclesiastic</i>. 25. 26.  
Which doubtless that wise and ancient Writer would 
never have advis'd, had either <i>Malachi</i> so lately 
forbidden it, or the Law by a full precept not left it 
lawful.  But I urge not this for want of better proof; 
our Saviour himself allows Divorce to be a command, 
<i>Mark</i> 10. 3, 5.  Neither do they weaken this assertion, 
who say it was only a sufferance, as shall be prov'd 
at large in that place of <i>Mark</i>.  But suppose it were 
not a written Law, they never can deny it was a 
custom, and so effect nothing.  For the same reasons 
that induce them why it should not be a Law, will 
straiten them as hard why it should be allow'd a 
custom.  All custom is either evil or not evil; if it be 
evil, this is the very end of Lawgiving, to abolish evil 
customs by wholesom Laws; unless we imagine <i>Moses</i> 
weaker than every negligent and startling Politician.  
If it be, as they make this of Divorce to be, a custom 
against nature, against justice, against charity, now, 
upon this most impure custom tolerated, could the 
God of pureness erect a nice and precise Law, that 
the Wife married after Divorce could not return to 
her former Husband, as being defiled?  What was all 
this following niceness worth, built upon the lewd 
foundation of a wicked thing allow'd?  In few words 
then, this custom of Divorce either was allowable or 
not allowable; if not allowable, how could it be 
allow'd? if it were allowable, all who understand Law 
will consent, that a tolerated custom hath the force 
of a Law, and is indeed no other but an unwritten 
Law, as <i>Justinian</i> calls it, and is as prevalent as any 
written statute.  So that their shift of turning this 
Law into a custom wheels about, and gives the onset 
upon their own flanks; not disproving, but 
concluding it to be the more firm Law, because it was 
without controversy a granted custom; as clear in 
the reason of common life, as those given rules 
wheron <a name="euclid"><i>Euclides</i></a> builds his propositions.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Thus being every way a Law of God, who can 
without blasphemy doubt it to be a just and pure 
Law?  <i>Moses</i> continually disavows the giving them 
any statute, or judgment, but what he learnt of God; 
of whom also in his Song he saith, <i>Deut</i>. 32.  <i>He is the 
rock, his work is perfect, all his ways are judgment, a 
God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is 
he</i>.  And <i>David</i> testifies, <i>the judgments of the Lord are 
true and righteous altogether</i>.  Not partly right and 
partly wrong, much less wrong altogether, as Divines 
of now-a-days dare censure them.  <i>Moses</i> again, of 
that people to whom he gave this Law, saith, <i>Deut</i>. 
14. <i>Ye are the children of the Lord your God, the 
Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people to 
himself above all the nations upon the earth, that 
thou shouldest keep all his Commandments, and be 
high in praise, in name, and in honour, holy to the 
Lord</i>, Chap. 26.  And in the fourth, <i>Behold I have 
taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord 
my God commanded me, keep therfore and do them.  
For this is your wisdom and your understanding in 
the sight of Nations that shall hear all these Statutes, 
and say, surely this great Nation is a wise and 
understanding people.  For what Nation is there so 
great, who hath God so nigh to them? and what 
Nation that hath Statutes and Judgments so 
righteous as all this Law which I set before you this 
day</i>?  Thus whether we look at the purity and justice 
of God himself, the jealousy of his honour among 
other Nations, the holiness and moral perfection 
which he intended by his Law to teach this people, we 
cannot possibly think how he could indure to let 
them slug and grow inveterately wicked, under base 
allowances, and whole adulterous lives by 
dispensation.  They might not eat, they might not 
touch an unclean thing; to what hypocrisy then were 
they train'd up, if by prescription of the same Law, 
they might be unjust, they might be adulterous for 
term of life? forbid to soil their garments with a coy 
imaginary pollution, but not forbid, but 
countenanced and animated by Law to soil their 
Souls with deepest defilements.  What more unlike to 
God, what more like that God should hate, than that 
his Law should be so curious to wash vessels, and 
vestures, and so careless to leave unwash'd, 
unregarded, so foul a scab of <i>Egypt</i>  in their Souls? 
what would we more? the Statutes of the Lord are all 
pure and just: and if all, then this of Divorce.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	<i>Because he hath found some uncleanness in her</i>. ]  
That we may not esteem this Law to be a meer 
authorizing of licence, as the Pharisees took it, <i>Moses</i> 
adds the reason, <i>for some uncleanness found</i>.  Some 
hertofore have bin so ignorant, as to have thought, 
that this uncleanness means Adultery.  But <i>Erasmus</i>, 
who for having writ an excellent <i>Treatise of Divorce</i>, 
was wrote against by some burly standard Divine 
perhaps of <i>Cullen</i>, or of <i>Louvain</i>, who calls himself 
<i>Phimostomus</i>, shews learnedly out of the Fathers, 
with other Testimonies and Reasons, that 
uncleanness is not here so understood; defends his 
former work, though new to that age, and perhaps 
counted licentious, and fears not to ingage all his 
fame on the Argument.  Afterward, when Expositors 
began to understand the Hebrew Text, which they 
had not done of many ages before,  they translated 
word for word not uncleanness, but <i>the nakedness of 
any thing</i>; and considering that nakedness is usually 
referr'd in Scripture to the mind as well as to the 
body, they constantly expound it any defect, 
annoyance, or ill quality in nature, which to be join'd 
with, makes life tedious, and such company worse 
than solitude.  So that here will be no cause to vary 
from the general consent of exposition, which gives 
us freely that God permitted divorce, for whatever 
was unalterably distastful, whether in body or mind.  
But with this admonishment, that if the <i>Roman</i> Law, 
especially in contracts and dowries, left many things 
to equity with these cautions, <i>ex fide bona, quod 
equius melius erit, ut inter bonos bene agitur</i>, we 
will not grudge to think that God intended not licence 
here to every humour, but to such remediless 
grievances as might move a good and honest and 
faithful man then to divorce, when it can no more be 
peace or comfort to either of them continuing thus 
join'd.  And although it could not be avoided, but 
that Men of hard hearts would abuse this liberty, yet 
doubtless it was intended, as all other privileges in 
Law are, to good men principally, to bad only by 
accident.  Also that the Sin was not in the 
permission, nor simply in the action of Divorce (for 
then the permitting also had bin sin) but only in the 
abuse.  But that this Law should, as it were, be wrung 
from God and <i>Moses</i>, only to serve the 
hardheartedness, and the lust of injurious men, how 
remote it is from all sense, and law, and honesty, and 
therfore surely from the meaning of Christ, shall 
abundantly be manifest in due order.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Now although <i>Moses</i> needed not to add other 
reason of this Law than that one there exprest, yet 
to these ages wherin Canons, and Scotisms, and 
Lumbard Laws, have dull'd, and almost obliterated 
the lively Sculpture of ancient reason, and 
humanity, it will be requisit to heap reason upon 
reason, and all little enough to vindicate the 
whiteness and the innocence of this divine Law, from 
the calumny it finds at this day, of being a door to 
licence and confusion.  Whenas indeed there is not a 
judicial point in all <i>Moses</i>, consisting of more true 
equity, high wisdom, and god-like pity than this Law; 
not derogating, but preserving the honour and peace 
of Marriage, and exactly agreeing with the sense and 
mind of that institution of <i>Genesis</i>.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	For first, if Marriage be but an ordain'd relation, 
as it seems not more, it cannot take place above the 
prime dictates of nature; and if it be of natural right, 
yet it must yield to that which is more natural, and 
before it by eldership and precedence in nature.  
Now it is not natural that <i>Hugh</i> marries <i>Beatrice</i>, or 
<i>Thomas</i> <i>Rebecca</i>, being only a civil contract, and full 
of many chances; but that these men seek them meet 
helps, that only is natural, and that they espouse 
them such, that only is Marriage.  But if they find 
them neither fit helps nor tolerable society, what 
thing more natural, more original and first in nature 
than to depart from that which is irksom, grievous, 
actively hateful, and injurious even to hostility, 
especially in a conjugal respect, wherin antipathies 
are invincible, and where the forc'd abiding of the 
one can be no true good, no real comfort to the 
other?  For if he find no contentment from the other, 
how can he return it from himself? or no acceptance, 
how can he mutually accept?  What more equal, more 
pious than to untie a civil knot for a natural enmity 
held by violence from parting, to dissolve an 
accidental conjunction of this or that Man and 
Woman, for the most natural and most necessary 
disagreement of meet  from unmeet, guilty from 
guiltless, contrary from contrary?  It being certain 
that the mystical and blessed unity of Marriage can 
be no way more unhallow'd and profan'd, than by 
the forcible uniting of such disunions and 
separations.  Which if we see oftimes they cannot join 
or piece up to a common friendship, or to a willing 
conversation in the same house, how should they 
possibly agree to the most familiar and united amity 
of Wedloc?  <i>Abraham</i> and <i>Lot</i>, though dear friends 
and brethren in a strange Country, chose rather to 
part asunder, than to infect their friendship with the 
strife of their servants: <i>Paul</i> and <i>Barnabas</i>, join'd 
together by the Holy Ghost to a spiritual work, 
thought it better to separate when once they grew at 
variance.  If these great Saints, join'd by Nature, 
Friendship, Religion, high Providence, and 
Revelation, could not so govern a casual difference, a 
sudden passion, but must in wisdom divide from the 
outward duties of a Friendship, or a Colleagueship in 
the same family, or in the same journey, lest it 
should grow to a worse division; can any thing be 
more absurd and barbarous, than that they whom 
only Error, Casualty, Art, or Plot, hath joined, should 
be compell'd, not against a sudden passion, but 
against the permanent and radical discords of 
Nature, to the most intimate and incorporating 
duties of Love and Imbracement, therin only rational 
and human, as they are free and voluntary; being 
else an abject and servile yoke, scarce not brutish?  
And that there is in man such a peculiar sway of 
liking or disliking in the affairs of Matrimony, is 
evidently seen before Marriage among those who can 
be friendly, can respect each other, yet to marry 
each other would not for any perswasion.  If then 
this unfitness and disparity be not till after Marriage 
discover'd, through many Causes, and Colours, and 
Concealments, that may overshadow; undoubtedly it 
will produce the same effects, and perhaps with more 
vehemence, that such a mistaken pair would give the 
world to be unmarried again.  And their condition 
<i>Solomon</i> to the plain justification of Divorce 
expresses, <i>Prov</i>. 30. 21, 23. where he tells us of his 
own accord, that a hated, or a hateful Woman, when 
she is married, <i>is a thing for which the earth is 
disquieted, and cannot bear it</i>: thus giving divine 
testimony to this divine Law, which bids us nothing 
more than is the first and most innocent lesson of 
Nature, to turn away peaceably from what afflicts, 
and hazards our destruction; especially when our 
staying can do no good, and is expos'd to all evil.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Secondly, It is unjust that any Ordinance, 
ordain'd to the good and comfort of Man, where that 
end is missing, without his fault, should be forc'd 
upon him to an unsufferable misery and discomfort, 
if not commonly ruin.  All Ordinances are establisht 
in their end; the end of Law is the vertue, is the 
righteousness of Law: and therfore him we count an 
ill Expounder who urges Law against the intention 
therof.  The general end of every Ordinance, of every 
severest, every divinest, even of Sabbath, is the 
good of Man; yea his temporal good not excluded.  But 
Marriage is one of the benignest ordinances of God to 
man, wherof both the general and particular end is 
the peace and contentment of man's mind, as the 
institution declares.  Contentment of body they 
grant, which if it be defrauded, the plea of frigidity 
shall divorce: But here lies the fathomless absurdity, 
that granting this for bodily defect, they will not 
grant it for any defect of the mind, any violation of 
religious or civil society.  Whenas, if the argument of 
Christ be firm against the ruler of the Synagogue, 
<i>Luke</i> 13.  <i>Thou hypocrite, doth not each of you on 
the Sabbath-day  loosen his Ox or his Ass from the 
stall, and lead him to watering, and should not I 
unbind a daughter of Abraham from this bond of 
Satan</i>?  It stands as good here; ye have regard in 
Marriage to the grievance of body, should you not 
regard more the grievances of the mind, seeing the 
Soul as much excels the body, as the outward man 
excels the Ass, and more? for that animal is yet a 
living creature, perfect in itself; but the body 
without the Soul is a meer senseless trunk.  No 
ordinance therfore given particularly to the good 
both spiritual and temporal of man, can be urged 
upon him to his mischief: and if they yield this to the 
unworthier part, the body, whereabout are they in 
their principles, that they yield it not to the more 
worthy the mind of a good man?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Thirdly, As no Ordinance, so no Covenant, no not 
between God and Man, much less between Man and 
Man, being, as all are, intended to the good of both 
Parties, can hold to the deluding or making miserable 
of them both.  For Equity is understood in every 
Covenant, even between enemies, tho' the terms be 
not exprest.  If Equity therfore made it, Extremity 
may dissolve it.  <i>But Marriage</i>, they use to say, <i>is the 
Covenant of God</i>.  Undoubted: and so in any Covenant 
frequently called in Scripture, wherin God is call'd to 
witness: The Covenant of Friendship between <i>David</i> 
and <i>Jonathan</i>, is call'd <i>the Covenant of the Lord</i>, 1 
<i>Sam</i>. 20.  The Covenant of <i>Zedekiah</i> with the King of 
Babel, a Covenant to be doubted whether lawful or 
no, yet in respect of God invok'd therto is call'd <i>the 
Oath, and the Covenant of God</i>, <i>Ezek</i>. 17.  Marriage 
also is call'd the Covenant of God, <i>Prov</i>. 2. 17.  Why, 
but as before, because God is the witness therof, <i>Mal</i>. 
2. 14.  So that this denomination adds nothing to the 
Covenant of Marriage, above any other civil and 
solemn contract: nor is it more indissoluble for this 
reason than any other against the end of its own 
Ordination; nor is any Vow or Oath to God exacted 
with such a rigour, where superstition reigns not.  
For look how much divine the Covenant is, so much 
the more equal, so much the more to be expected 
that every Article therof should be fairly made good; 
no false dealing, or unperforming should be thrust 
upon men without redress, if the covenant be so 
divine.  But Faith, they say, must be kept in 
Covenant, tho' to our damage.  I answer, that only 
holds true, where the other side performs; which 
failing, he is no longer bound.  Again, this is true, 
when the keeping of Faith can be of any use or 
benefit to the other.  But in Marriage, a league of 
Love and Willingness, if Faith be not willingly kept, it 
scarce is worth the keeping; nor can be any delight to 
a generous mind, with whom it is forcibly kept: and 
the question still supposes the one brought to an 
impossibility of keeping it as he ought, by the other's 
default; and to keep it formally, not only with a 
thousand shifts and dissimulations, but with open 
anguish, perpetual sadness and disturbance, no 
willingness, no cheerfulness, no contentment, cannot 
be any good to a mind not basely poor and shallow, 
with whom the contract of Love is so kept.  A 
Covenant therfore brought to that pass, is on the 
unfaulty side without injury dissolv'd.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Fourthly, The Law is not to neglect men under 
greatest sufferances, but to see Covenants of 
greatest moment faithfullest perform'd.  And what 
injury comparable to that sustain'd in a frustrate 
and false-dealing Marriage, to lose, for another's 
fault against him, the best portion of his temporal 
comforts, and of his spiritual too, as it may fall out?  
It was the Law, that for man's good and quiet, 
reduc'd things to propriety, which were at first in 
common; how much more Law-like were it to assist 
Nature in disappropriating that evil which by 
continuing proper becomes destructive?  But he 
might have bewar'd.  So he might in any other 
Covenant, wherin the Law does not constrain Error 
to so dear a forfeit.  And yet in these matters wherin 
the wisest are apt to err, all the wariness that can 
be, ofttimes nothing avails.  But the Law can compel 
the offending party to be more duteous.  Yes, if all 
these kind of offences were fit in public to be 
complain'd on, or being compell'd were any 
satisfaction to a mate not sottish, or malicious.  And 
these injuries work so vehemently, that if the Law 
remedy them not, by separating the cause when no 
way else will pacify, the person not reliev'd betakes 
him either to such disorderly courses, or to such a 
dull dejection as renders him either infamous, or 
useless to the service of God and his Country.   
Fifthly, The Law is to tender the liberty and the 
human dignity of them that live under the Law, 
whether it be the man's right above the woman, or 
the woman's just appeal against wrong and 
servitude.  But the duties of Marriage contain in 
them a duty of Benevolence, which to do by 
compulsion against the Soul, where there can be 
neither peace, nor joy, nor love, but an enthralment 
to one who either cannot, or will not be mutual in 
the godliest and the civilest ends of that society, is 
the ignoblest, and the lowest slavery that a human 
shape can be put to.  This Law therfore justly and 
piously provides against such an unmanly task of 
bondage as this.  The Civil Law, tho' it favour'd the 
setting free of a slave, yet if he prov'd ungrateful to 
his Patron, reduc'd him to a servile condition.  If that 
Law did well to reduce from liberty to bondage for an 
ingratitude not the greatest, much more became it 
the Law of God to enact the restorement of a free-
born man from an unpurpos'd, and unworthy 
bondage, to a rightful liberty, for the most unnatural 
fraud and ingratitude that can be committed against 
him.  And if the Civilian Emperor in his title of 
Donations, permit the giver to recall his gift from him 
who proves unthankful towards him; yea, tho' he 
had subscrib'd, and sign'd in the deed of the gift, not 
to recall it, though for this very cause of ingratitude; 
with much more equity doth Moses permit here the 
giver to recall no petty gift, but the gift of himself 
from one who most injuriously and deceitfully uses 
him against the main ends and condition of his giving 
himself, exprest in God's institution.<br><img

	Sixthly, Altho' there be nothing in the plain 
words of this Law, that seems to regard the afflictions 
of a Wife, how great soever; yet Expositors 
determine, and doubtless determine rightly, that God 
was not uncompassionate of them also in the framing 
of this Law.  For should the rescript of <i>Antoninus</i> in 
the Civil Law give release to servants flying for 
refuge to the Emperor's statue, by giving leave to 
change their cruel Masters; and should God, who in 
his Law also is good to injur'd servants, by granting 
them their freedom in divers cases, not consider the 
wrongs and miseries of a wife, which is no servant?  
Tho' herin the counter-sense of our Divines, to me, I 
must confess seems admirable; who teach that God 
gave this as a merciful Law, not for Man whom he 
here names, and to whom by name he gives this 
power; but for the Wife, whom he names not, and to 
whom by name he gives no power at all.  For 
certainly if Man be liable to injuries in Marriage, as 
well as Woman, and Man be the worthier Person, it 
were a preposterous Law to respect only the less 
worthy; her whom God made for Marriage, and not 
him at all for whom Marriage was made.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Seventhly, The Law of Marriage gives place to the 
power of parents: for we hold, that consent of 
Parents not had, may break the Wedloc, tho' else 
accomplisht.  It gives place to masterly Power, for the 
Master might take away from an <i>Hebrew</i> servant 
which he gave him, <i>Exod</i>. 21.  If it be answer'd, that 
the Marriage of Servants is no Matrimony: 'tis 
reply'd, That this in the ancient <i>Roman</i> Law is true, 
not in the <i>Mosaic</i>.  If it be added, she was a Stranger, 
not an <i>Hebrew</i>, therfore easily divorc'd; it will be 
answer'd, That Strangers not being Canaanites, and 
they also being Converts, might be lawfully married, 
as <i>Rahab</i> was.  And her conversion is here suppos'd; 
for an <i>Hebrew</i> master could not lawfully give an 
Heathen wife to an <i>Hebrew</i> servant.  However, the 
divorcing of an Israelitish woman was as easy by the 
Law, as the divorcing of a Stranger, and almost in the 
same words permitted, <i>Deut</i>. 24. and <i>Deut</i>. 21.  
Lastly, it gives place to the right of War, for a captive 
Woman lawfully marry'd, and afterwards not 
belov'd, might be dismiss'd, only without ransom, 
<i>Deut</i>. 21.  If Marriage be dissolv'd by so many 
exterior powers, not superior, as we think, why may 
not the power of Marriage it self, for its own peace 
and honour, dissolve it self, where the persons 
wedded be free persons?  Why may not a greater and 
more natural power complaining dissolve Marriage?  
For the ends why Matrimony was ordain'd, are 
certainly and by all Logic above all the Ordinance it 
self; why may not that dissolve Marriage, without 
which that institution hath no force at all?  For the 
prime ends of Marriage, are the whole strength and 
validity therof, without which Matrimony is like an 
Idol, nothing in the world.  But those former 
allowances were all for hardness of heart.  Be that 
granted, until we come where to understand it 
better: if the Law suffer thus far the obstinacy of a 
bad man, is it not more righteous here, to do 
willingly what is but equal, to remove in season the 
extremities of a good man?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Eighthly, If a man had deflowr'd a Virgin, or 
brought an ill name on his Wife that she came not a 
Virgin to him, he was amerc'd in certain shekels of 
Silver, and bound never to divorce her all his days, 
<i>Deut</i>. 22. which shews that the Law gave no liberty to 
divorce, where the injury was palpable; and that the 
absolute forbidding to divorce, was in part the 
punishment of a deflowerer, and a defamer.  Yet not 
so but that the wife questionless might depart when 
she pleases.  Otherwise this course had not so much 
righted her, as delivered her up to more spight and 
cruel usage.  This Law therfore doth justly 
distinguish the privilege of an honest and blameless 
man in the matter of divorce from the punishment of 
a notorious offender.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Ninthly, Suppose it should be imputed to a man 
that he was too rash in his choice, and why he took 
not better heed, let him now smart, and bear his 
folly as he may; altho' the Law of God, that terrible 
Law, do not thus upbraid the infirmities and 
unwilling mistakes of man in his integrity: But 
suppose these and the like proud aggravations of 
some stern hypocrite, more merciless in his mercies, 
than any literal Law in the vigour of severity, must 
be patiently heard; yet all Law, and God's Law 
especially grants every-where to error easy 
remitments, even where the utmost penalty exacted 
were no undoing.  With great reason therfore and 
mercy doth it here not torment an error, if it be so, 
with the indurance of a whole life lost to all houshold 
comfort and society, a punishment of too vast and 
huge dimension for an error, and the more 
unreasonable for that the like objection may be 
oppos'd against the plea of divorcing for Adultery; he 
might have lookt better before to her breeding under 
religious parents: why did he not more diligently 
inquire into her manners, into what company she 
kept? every glance of her eye, every step of her gait 
would have prophesy'd adultery, if the quick scent of 
these discerners had been took along; they had the 
divination to have foretold you all this, as they have 
now the divinity to punish an error inhumanly.  As 
good reason to be content, and forc'd to be content 
with your Adulteress, if these objecters might be the 
judges of human frailty.  But God, more mild and 
good to man, than man to his brother, in all this 
liberty given to divorcement, mentions not a word of 
our past errors and mistakes, if any were, which 
these men objecting from their own inventions, 
prosecute with all violence and iniquity.  For if the 
one be to look so narrowly what he takes, at the peril 
of ever keeping, why should not the other be made 
as wary what is promis'd, by the peril of losing? for 
without those promises the treaty of Marriage had 
not proceeded.  Why should his own error bind him, 
rather than the other's fraud acquit him?  Let the 
buyer beware, saith the old Law-beaten termer.  
Belike then there is no more honesty, nor ingenuity 
in the bargain of a Wedloc, than in the buying of a 
Colt: We must it seems drive it on as craftily with 
those whose affinity we seek, as if they were a pack 
of sale-men and complotters.  But the deceiver 
deceives himself in the unprosperous Marriage, and 
therin is sufficiently punisht.  I answer, that the 
most of those who deceive, are such as either 
understand not, or value not the true purposes of 
Marriage; they have the prey they seek, not the 
punishment: yet say it prove to them some cross, it 
is not equal that error and fraud should be linkt in 
the same degree of forfeiture, but rather that error 
should be acquitted, and fraud bereav'd his morsel, if 
the mistake were not on both sides; for then on both 
sides the acquitment will be reasonable, if the 
bondage be intolerable; which this Law graciously 
determines, not unmindful of the wife, as was 
granted willingly to the common Expositors, tho' 
beyond the letter of this Law, yet not beyond the 
spirit of charity.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Tenthly, Marriage is a solemn thing, some say a 
holy, the resemblance of Christ and his Church? and 
so indeed it is where the persons are truly religious; 
and we know all sacred things not perform'd 
sincerely as they ought, are no way acceptable to 
God in their outward formality.  And that wherin it 
differs from personal duties, if they be not truly 
done, the fault is in our selves; but Marriage to be a 
true and pious Marriage is not in the single power of 
any person; the essence wherof, as of all other 
Covenants, is in relation to another, the making and 
maintaining causes therof are all mutual, and must 
be a communion of spiritual and temporal comforts.  
If then either of them cannot, or obstinately will not 
be answerable in these duties, so as that the other 
can have no peaceful living, or endure the want of 
what he justly seeks, and sees no hope, then strait 
from that dwelling love, which is the soul of Wedloc, 
takes his flight, leaving only some cold performances 
of civil and common respects; but the true bond of 
Marriage, if there were ever any there, is already 
burst like a rotten thread.  Then follows 
dissimulation, suspicion, false colours, false pretences 
and worse than these, disturbance, annoyance, 
vexation, sorrow, temptation even in the faultless 
person, weary of himself, and of all actions public or 
domestic; then comes disorder, neglect, hatred, and 
perpetual strife, all these the enemies of Holiness and 
Christianity, and every one persisted in, a 
remediless violation of Matrimony.  Therfore God who 
hates all feigning and formality, where there should 
be all faith and sincereness, and abhors the 
inevitable discord, where there should be greater 
concord, when thro' another's default, faith and 
concord cannot be, counts it neither just to punish 
the innocent with the Transgressor, nor holy, nor 
honourable for the sanctity of Marriage, that should 
be the union of peace and love to be made the 
commitment, and close fight of enmity and hate.  And 
therfore doth in this Law, what best agrees with his 
goodness, loosning a sacred thing to peace and 
charity, rather than binding it to hatred and 
contention; loosning only the outward and formal tie 
of that which is already inwardly and really broken, 
or else was really never join'd.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Eleventhly, One of the chief matrimonial ends is 
said to seek a holy seed; but where an unfit Marriage 
administers continual cause of hatred and distemper, 
there, as was heard before, cannot choose but much 
unholiness abide.  Nothing more unhallows a man, 
more unprepares him to the service of God in any 
duty, than a habit of wrath and perturbation, arising 
from the importunity of troublous causes never 
absent.  And where the houshold stands in this 
plight, what love can there be to the unfortunate 
issue, what care of their breeding, which is of main 
conducement to their being holy?  God therfore 
knowing how unhappy it would be for children to be 
born in such a family, gives this Law either as a 
prevention, that being an unhappy pair, they should 
not add to tbe unhappy parents, or else as a remedy 
that if there be children, while they are fewest, they 
may follow either parent, as shall be agreed, or 
judg'd, from the house of hatred and discord to place 
of more holy and peaceable education.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Twelfthly, All Law is available to some good end, 
but the final prohibition of Divorce avails to no good 
end, causing only the endless aggravation of evil, and 
therfore this permission of divorce was given to the 
Jews by the wisdom and fatherly providence of God; 
who knew that Law cannot command love, without 
which Matrimony hath no true being, no good, no 
solace, nothing of God's instituting, nothing but so 
sordid and so low, as to be disdain'd of any generous 
person.  Law cannot inable natural inability either of 
body, or mind, which gives the grievance; it cannot 
make equal those inequalities, it cannot make fit 
those unfitnesses; and where there is malice more 
than defect of nature, it cannot hinder ten thousand 
injuries, and bitter actions of despight, too suttle and 
too unapparent for Law to deal with.  And while it 
seeks to remedy more outward wrongs, it exposes 
the injur'd person to other more inward and more 
cutting.  All these evils unavoidably will redound 
upon the children, if any be, and upon the whole 
family.  It degenerates and disorders the best spirits, 
leaves them to unsettled imaginations, and degraded 
hopes, careless of themselves, their housholds and 
their friends, unactive to all public service, dead to 
the Commonwealth; wherin they are by one mishap, 
and no willing trespass of theirs, outlaw'd from all 
the benefits and comforts of married life and 
posterity.  It confers as little to the honour and 
inviolable keeping of Matirmony, but sooner stirs up 
temptations and occasions to secret adulteries and 
unchaste roving.  But it maintains public honesty.  
Public folly rather; who shall judge of public 
honesty?  The Law of God and of ancientest 
Christians, and all Civil Nations, or the illegitimate 
Law of Monks and Canonists, the most malevolent, 
most unexperienc'd, most incompetent Judges of 
Matrimony?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	These reasons, and many more that might be 
alleg'd, afford us plainly to perceive, both what good 
cause this Law had to do for good men in mischances, 
and what necessity it had to suffer accidentally the 
hard-heartedness of bad men, which could not 
certainly discover, or discovering, could not subdue, 
no nor endeavour to restrain without multiplying 
sorrow to them, for whom all was indeavour'd.  The 
guiltless  therfore were not depriv'd their needful 
redresses, and the hard hearts of others 
unchastisable in those judicial Courts, were so 
remitted there, as bound over to the higher Session 
of Conscience.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Notwithstanding all this, there is a loud exception 
against this Law of God, nor can the holy Author 
save his Law from this exception, that it opens a door 
to all licence and confusion.  But this is the rudest, I 
was almost saying the most graceless objection, and 
with the least reverence to God and Moses, that could 
be devis'd: This is to cite God before man's Tribunal, 
to arrogate a wisdom and holiness above him.  Did not 
God then foresee what event of licence or confusion 
could follow?  Did not he know how to ponder these 
abuses with more prevailing respects, in the most 
even ballance of his justice and pureness, till these 
correctors came up to shew him better?  The Law is, 
if it stir up sin any way, to stir it up by forbidding, as 
one contrary excites another, <i>Rom</i>. 7. but if it once 
come to provoke sin, by granting licence to sin, 
according to Laws that have no other honest end, but 
only to permit the fulfilling of obstinate lust, how is 
God not made the contradicter of himself?  No man 
denies that best things may be abus'd: but it is a Rule 
resulting from many pregnant expeeriences, that 
what doth most harm in the abusing, us'd rightly 
doth most good.  And such a good to take away from 
honest men, for being abus'd by such as abuse all 
things, is the greatest abuse of all.  That the whole 
Law is no further useful, than as a man uses it 
lawfully, S. <i>Paul</i> teaches 1 <i>Tim</i>. 1.  And that Christian 
liberty may be us'd for an occasion to the flesh, the 
same Apostle confesses, <i>Gal</i>. 5. yet thinks not of 
removing it for that, but bids us rather stand fast in 
the liberty wherwith Christ hath freed us, and not 
be held again in the yoke of bondage.  The very 
permission which Christ gave to Divorce for 
Adultery, may be foully abus'd, by any whose 
hardness of heart can either feign Adultery, or dares 
commit, that he may divorce.  And for this cause the 
Pope, and hitherto the Church of England, forbid all 
divorce from the bond of Marriage, tho' for openest 
Adultery.  If then it be righteous to hinder for the 
fear of abuse, that which God's Law, notwithstanding 
that caution, hath warranted to be done, doth not 
our righteousness come short of Antichrist? or do we 
not rather herein conform our selves to his 
unrighteousness in this undue and unwise fear?  For 
God regards more to relieve by this Law the just 
complaints of good men, than to curb the licence of 
wicked men, to the crushing withal, and the 
overwhelming of his afflicted servants.  He loves 
more that his Law should look with pity upon the 
difficulties of his own, than with rigor upon the 
boundless riots of them who serve another Master, 
and hinder'd here by the strictness, will break 
another way to worse enormities.  If this Law 
therfore have any good reasons for which God gave 
it, and no intention of giving scope to lewdness, but 
as abuse by accident comes in with every good Law, 
and every good thing, it cannot be wisdom in us, 
while we can content us with God's wisdom, nor can 
be purity, if his purity will suffice us, to except 
against this Law, as if it foster'd licence.  But if they 
affirm this Law had no other end, but to permit 
obdurat lust, because it would be obdurat, making 
the Law of God intentionally to proclaim and enact 
Sin lawful, as if the will of God were become sinful, or 
Sin stronger than his direct and law-giving will, the 
men would be admonish'd to look well to it, that while 
they are so eager to shut the door against licence, 
they do open a worse door to blasphemy.  And yet 
they shall be here further shewn their iniquity; 
what more foul common sin among us than 
drunkenness?  And who can be ignorant, that if the 
importation of Wine, and the use of all strong drink, 
were forbid, it would both clean rid the possibility of 
committing that odious vice, and men might 
afterwards live happily and healthfully without the 
use of those intoxicating liquors.  Yet who is there 
the severest of them all, that ever propounded to 
lose his Sack, his Ale, toward the certain abolishing of 
so great a Sin?  Who is there of them, the holiest, 
that less loves his rich canary at meals, tho' it be 
fetcht from places that hazard the Religion of them 
who fetch it, and tho' it make his Neighbour drunk 
out of the same Tun?  While they forbid not therfore 
the use of that liquid Merchandize, which forbidden 
would utterly remove a most loathsome sin, and not 
impair either the health or the refreshment of 
mankind, supply'd many other ways; why do they 
forbid a Law of God, the forbidding wherof brings into 
excessive bondage oftimes the best of men, and 
betters not the worse?  He to remove a national vice, 
will not pardon his cups, nor think it concerns him to 
forbear the quaffing of that outlandish Grape, in his 
unnecessary fulness, tho' other men abuse it never 
so much; nor is he so abstemious as to intercede with 
the Magistrate that all matter of drunkenness be 
banish'd the Commonwealth; and yet for the fear of a 
less inconvenience unpardonably requires of his 
brethren, in their extreme necessity, to debar 
themselves the use of God's permissive Law, tho' it 
might be their saving, and no man's indangering the 
more.  Thus this peremptory strictness we may 
discern of what sort it is, how unequal and how 
unjust.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	<i>But it will breed confusion</i>.  What confusion it 
would breed, God himself took the care to prevent in 
the fourth verse of this Chapter, that the divorc'd 
being married to another, might not return to her 
former husband.  And <i>Justinian</i>'s Law counsels the 
same in his Title of <i>Nuptials</i>.  And what confusion else 
can there be in separation, to separate upon extreme 
urgency, the religious from the irreligious, the fit 
from the unfit, the willing from the wilful, the abus'd 
from the abuser?  Such a separation is quite 
contrary to confusion.  But to bind and mix together 
holy with atheist, heavenly with hellish, fitness with 
unfitness, light with darkness, antipathy with 
antipathy, the injur'd with the injurer, and force 
them into the most inward nearness of a detested 
union, this doubtless is the most horrid, the most 
unnatural mixture, the greatest confusion that can 
be confus'd.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Thus by this plain and Christian <i>Talmud</i>, 
vindicating the Law of God from irreverent and 
unwary expostions, I trust, where it shall meet with 
intelligible perusers, some stay at least of men's 
thoughts will be obtain'd, to consider these many 
prudent and righteous ends of this divorcing 
permission: That it may have, for the great Author's 
sake, hereafter some competent allowance to be 
counted a little purer than the prerogative of a legal 
and public ribaldry, granted to that holy seed.  So 
that from hence, we shall hope to find the way still 
more open to the reconciling of those places which 
treat this matter in the Gospel.  And thither now 
without interruption the course of method brings us.
