Milton certainly performed such exercises (see his <a href=\"../../paraphrase_114/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">paraphrase on Psalm 114</a>), but many of the translations published in the <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/60223/83\" target=\"main\">1673 edition of <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span></a> appear to have been done as much for devotional as for linguistic exercise.
