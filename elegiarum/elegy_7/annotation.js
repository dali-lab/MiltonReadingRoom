"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>.  Milton wanted us to believe this poem was composed in May 1627, and perhaps it was, though <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Merritt Y. Hughes</a> (58) prefers 1630.  The poem represents its author as, like Ovid and Virgil and many other great poets before him, a one-time victim of Love\'s arrows who plans now to leave love and love elegies behind for more a more serious muse.  Though some critics take the story of being smitten by a young beauty as autobiographical, others regard it as entirely formulaic.  Milton identifies himself as passing that stage between love poetry that all great poets before him once passed through. The final apology is equally formulaic.</p><p class=\"next\">The translation follows that of <a href=\"../../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mackellar_latin\" target=\"main\">Walter MacKellar</a> with a few changes based on consulting <a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#columbia_milton\" target=\"main\">The Columbia Milton</a> and <a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Merritt Y.
