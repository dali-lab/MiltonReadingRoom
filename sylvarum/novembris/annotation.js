"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. Milton titled this collection of Latin and Greek verses, \"Sylvarum,\" or \"of the woods,\" indicating the variety of metrical forms included, even a variety of languages, since two are in Greek. The metrical forms employed here include iambics, hexameters and various kinds of Horatian modes, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcaic_stanza\" target=\"main\">alcaic stanzas</a>. Milton arranged the poems in a roughly chronological order according to their dates of composition, probably to emphasize his progress as a poet from his earliest attempts to his more mature poems.</p><p class=\"next\">This miniature epic poem commemorates the foiling of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot\" target=\"main\">Gunpowder Plot of 1605</a>. It was probably composed in 1625 for the eleventh anniversary of the plot on November 5, the first to be celebrated following the death on 27 March of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England\" target=\"main\">King James I</a> (6th of Scotland). The plot, led by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes\" target=\"main\">Guy Fawkes</a> and a group of discontented Roman Catholics, was to explode gunpowder in the basement of the Parliament chamber while King James I was in assembly with both houses of Parliament.</span>",
