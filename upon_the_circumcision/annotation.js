Perhaps the young Milton hoped the three  would serve as a kind of poetic triptych marking these events in Christ\'s life, the liturgical calendar, and the apocalyptic events they both pointed towards and promised, but of course, \"The Passion\" was deliberately left unfinished.  The <a href=\"http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03779a.htm\" target=\"main\">Feast of the Circumcision</a> falls on January 1, though this feast, like most others on the liturgical calendar, was not popular among puritans.  As in the Nativity Ode and \"The Passion,\" this poem expresses both wonder, admiration, grief, and gratitude for the sacrifice the Son of God is said to have made by becoming human.  \"The Circumcision\" also dwells on the corollary condescension of submitting to the Hebrew Law, and what Milton calls \"vengeful Justice.\"  The blood shed during circumcision anticipates the bloodshed of crucifixion.  Also implied by the final line is a conflicted connection, both euphemistic and succesionistically competitive, between the manhood represented by the penis, and the manliness represented by the heart.  The poem appears in the Trinity Manuscript and its date of composition is unknown, though often supposed to be 1633.</span>",

"tear":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>no tear.</i>  Many believed that angels, whose essence was fire, could shed no tears of their own.  Milton imagines angels expressing sadness without human-like tears in <a href=\"../pl/book_1/text.shtml#angeltears\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> 1.620</a> and <a href=\"../pl/book_10/text.shtml#angeltears\" target=\"main\">10.23-24</a>.</span>",

"sease":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>sease.</i>  Seize.  The poem invites us to imagine that the Son of God, who yielded up all his heavenly pomp and glory to become a human infant, falls prey&mdash;because he willingly submits&mdash;almost immediately to original sin, \"our sin.\"  Seizing the penis for circumcision becomes an image of original sin seizing the newly incarnated son of God, as if the penis/phallus is at once the sign of godliness, manliness, carnality, and fragile infancy; it signifies the place of loss&mdash;lost innocence, lost manliness, lost godliness.</span>",
"lost":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>lost in death.</i>  The practice of circumcision is here treated as emblematic of being \"lost in death.\"  Another Puritan/Pauline expression for this is \"under the law\"  (see <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Galatians+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Galatians  2</a>:21 and <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Galations+3&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">3</a>:23).</span>",
