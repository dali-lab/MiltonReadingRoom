without perpetual <span class="varspell" title="watchfulness">watchfulnes</span> and perseverance. When as one above others who hath <a href="" id="suffered" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> much and long</a> in the defence of 
Truth, shall after all this, give her cause to <span class="varspell" title="leave">leav</span> him so destitute and so vacant of her defence, as 
to <span class="varspell" title="yield">yeild</span> his mouth to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the common road of Truth and <span class="varspell" title="Falsehood">Falshood</span>, and such <span class="varspell" title="falsehood">falshood</span> as is

complaint is, <span class="mi">Printed in the City</span>, maintaining either in the title, or in the whole

can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> to both no good at all, but an intolerable injury and temptation to the wronged and the

<span class="varspell" title="wholesome">wholsom</span> <a href="" id="national" class="annotBtn">national Law</a>, not to be <span class="varspell" title="withheld">with-held</span> from

that book, but must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="entered">enterd</span> a bold and impious accusation against God himself; who did not 
for this abuse withhold it from his own people. It will <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> just <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span>, and best for the 
reputation of him who in his <a href="" id="Subitanes" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Subitanes</span></a> hath thus <span class="varspell" title="censured">censur'd</span>, to recall his sentence. And if, out 
of the abundance of his volumes, and the readiness of his quill, and the vastness of his other <a href="" id="employments" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="employments">imploiments</span></a>, especially in the 
great audit for accounts, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> can spare us ought to the better understanding of this point, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> shall

Provided he <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> sure not to come with those old and stale suppositions, unless <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> can take away 
<span class="varspell" title="clearly">cleerly</span> what that <span class="varspell" title="discourse">discours</span> hath <span class="varspell" title="urged">urg'd</span> against them, by one who will expect other arguments to 
<span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> the  good health of a 
sound answer, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <a href="" id="gout" class="annotBtn">gout</a> and <a href="" id="dropsy" class="annotBtn">dropsy</a> of <a href="" id="margent" class="annotBtn">a big <span class="varspell" title="margin">margent</span></a>, <span class="varspell" title="littered">litter'd</span> and overlaid with 
crude and <span class="varspell" title="huddled">huddl'd</span> quotations. But as I still was waiting, when these light <span class="varspell" title="armed">arm'd</span> refuters would 
have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> pelting at <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> three lines <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utterd</span> with a sage delivery of no reason, but an impotent and 
<span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="" id="bonner" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Bonner-</span></a>like 
censure to burn that which 
provokes them to a fair dispute, at length a book was brought to my hands, <span class="varspell" title="entitled">entitl'd</span> <a href="" id="answer" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">An Answer to the Doctrine and Discipline 
of Divorce</span></a>. Gladly I <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> it, and very attentively <span class="varspell" title="composed">compos'd</span> myself to read; hoping 
that now <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> good man had <span class="varspell" title="vouchsafed">voutsaft</span> the pains to instruct <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> better, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> I could yet learn out of 
all the volumes which for this <span class="varspell" title="purpose">purpos</span> I had visited. Only this I <span class="varspell" title="marveled">marvel'd</span>, and other men have 
since, when as I, in a Subject so new to this age, and so hazardous to please, <a href="" id="name" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="concealed">conceal'd</span> not my name</a>, why this Author 
defending that part which is so creeded by the people, would conceal his? But ere I could enter 
three leaves into the <span class="varspell" title="Pamphlet">Pamflet</span>, (for I <span class="varspell" title="defer">deferr</span> the peasantly <span class="varspell" title="rudeness">rudenes</span>, which by the <a href="" id="licenser" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Licenser's">Licencers</span></a> <span class="varspell" title="leave">leav</span> I met with afterwards) my satisfaction came in 
abundantly, that it could <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> nothing why <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> durst not name himself, but the guilt of his own 
<span class="varspell" title="wretchedness">wretchednes</span>. For first, not to speak of his abrupt and bald beginning, his very first page 
notoriously <a href="" id="bewray" class="annotBtn"><span class="bewrays">bewraies</span></a> him an 
<span class="varspell" title="illiterate">illiterat</span>, and arrogant presumer in 
that which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> understands not; bearing us in hand as if <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> knew both Greek and <span class="varspell" title="Hebrew">Ebrew</span>, and is 
not able to spell it; which had <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span>, it had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> either <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> as it ought, or <a href="" id="scored" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="scored">scor'd</span></a> upon the Printer. If it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="excused">excus'd</span> 
as the <span class="varspell" title="carelessness">carelesnes</span> of his deputy, <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> it known, the <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> Author himself is inventoried, and 
<span class="varspell" title="summed">summ'd</span> up, to the utmost value of his <a href="" id="cloak" class="annotBtn">Livery cloak</a>. Who ever <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span>, though this to <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> may seem a slight 
contest, I shall yet continue to think that man full of other secret injustice, and deceitfull pride, who shall 
offer in public to assume the skill, though it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> but of a tongue which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> hath not, and would 
catch his readers to <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> of his ability, that which is not in him. The <span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span> indeed, as his 
<span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> now stands, may <span class="varspell" title="license">licence</span> much; but if these Greek <a href="" id="ortho" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Orthographies</span></a> were of his <span class="varspell" title="licensing">licencing</span>; the <span class="varspell" title="boys">boyes</span> at School might 
<span class="varspell" title="reckon">reck'n</span> with him at his Grammar. Nor did I <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> this his want of the pretended Languages alone, 
but accompanied with such a low and home-spun expression of his Mother <span class="mi">English</span> all 
along, without <span class="varspell" title="joint">joynt</span> or frame, as made <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> ere I knew <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> of him, often stop, and conclude, 
that this Author could for certain <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> no other <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> <a href="" id="mechanic" class="annotBtn">mechanic</a>. Nor was the <span class="varspell" title="style">stile</span> flat and rude, and the matter grave and 
solid, for then <span class="varspell" title="there">ther</span> had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> pardon, but so shallow and so unwary was that also, as gave 
sufficiently the character of a gross and sluggish, yet a contentious and overweening pretender. 
For first, it behooving him to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span>, as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> promises, what divorce is, and what the true doctrine 
and Discipline <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span>, and this <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> by such principles and <span class="varspell" title="proofs">prooffs</span> as are <span class="varspell" title="received">receav'd</span> on 
both sides, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="performs">performes</span> neither of these; but <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> it first from the <span class="mi">Judaical</span> practice, which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> 
himself disallows, and next from the practice of <a href="" id="canon" class="annotBtn">Canon Law</a>, which the Book <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> would confute, utterly rejects, and all 
Laws depending <span class="varspell" title="thereon">theron</span>; which this puny <a href="" id="clark" class="annotBtn">Clark</a> calls <span class="mi">The Laws of England</span>, and yet pronounces them 
<span class="mi">by an Ecclesiastical Judge</span>: as if that were to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> accounted the Law of <span class="mi">England</span>, 
which depended on <a href="" id="popery" class="annotBtn">the Popery of <span class="mi">England</span></a>; or if it were, this Parlament <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> might know 
hath now <span class="varspell" title="damned">damn'd</span> <a href="" id="judicature" class="annotBtn">that judicature</a>. 
So that whether his meaning were to inform his own party, or to confute his adversary, instead of 
<span class="varspell" title="showing">shewing</span> us the true <span class="varspell" title="Doctrine">Doctrin</span> and Discipline of Divorce, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> us nothing but his own 
contemptible ignorance. For what is the <span class="mi">Mosaic</span> Law to his opinion, and what is the 
Canon utterly now antiquated, either to that or to mine? Yee see already what a faithfull definer 
<span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> have him. From such a <a href="" id="egg" class="annotBtn">wind egg</a> of 
definition as this, they who expect any of his other arguments to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> well <span class="varspell" title="hatched">hatcht</span>, let them enjoy the <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertu</span> of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> 
worthy Champion. But one thing more I <span class="varspell" title="observed">observ'd</span>, a singular note of his stupidity, and that his 
Trade is not to meddle with Books, much less with Confutations. When as <span class="mi">the <span class="varspell" title="Doctrine">Doctrin</span> of 
Divorce</span> had now a whole year <a href="" id="publish" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> 
<span class="varspell" title="published">publisht</span> the second time</a>, with many Arguments added, and the former ones <span class="varspell" title="bettered">better'd</span> and 
<span class="varspell" title="cofirmed">confirm'd</span>, this idle <span class="varspell" title="pamphlet">pamflet</span> comes reeling forth against the first Edition only; as may appear to 
any by the pages quoted. Which put me in <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> of what by chance I had notice of to this 
<span class="varspell" title="purpose">purpos</span> the last Summer, as nothing so serious but <span class="varspell" title="happens">happns</span> oft times to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> attended with a 
ridiculous accident, it was then told <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> that <span class="mi">the <span class="varspell" title="Doctrine">Doctrin</span> of divorce</span> was <span class="varspell" title="answered">answerd</span>, and 
the answer half Printed against the first Edition; not by one, but by a pack of heads; of whom the 
<span class="varspell" title="chief">cheif</span>, by circumstance, was intimated to <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>, and since <span class="varspell" title="ratified">ratifi'd</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> no other, if any can hold laughter, and I am sure none will 
guess him lower, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> an actual Serving-man. This creature, for the Story must on, (and what 
though <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the lowest person of an interlude, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> may <span class="varspell" title="deserve">deserv</span> a <a href="" id="canvassing" class="annotBtn">canvasing</a>,) transplanted himself, and 
to the <span class="varspell" title="improvement">improvment</span> of his wages, and your better notice of his capacity, <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> <a href="" id="solicit" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Soliciter">Solliciter</span></a>. And having <span class="varspell" title="conversed">convers'd</span> much 
with a stripling Divine or two of those newly fledge <a href="" id="probation" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Probationers</span></a>, that usually 
come scouting from the University, and <span class="varspell" title="lie">ly</span> <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> no lame  <a href="" id="leger" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">legers</span></a> to pop into the the <a href="" id="Bethesda" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Bethesda</span></a> of <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> Knights Chaplainship, where they bring grace 
to his good cheer, but no peace or benediction <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> to his house; these made the <a href="" id="Champarty" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Champarty</span></a>, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> contributed 
the Law, and both <span class="varspell" title="joined">joynd</span> in the Divinity. Which made <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> intend, following the advice also of 
<span class="varspell" title="friends">freinds</span>, to lay aside the thought of mis-spending a Reply to the <span class="varspell" title="buzz">buzze</span> of such a <span class="varspell" title="Drone's">Drones</span> nest. But 
finding that it lay, what ever was the matter, half a year after <span class="varspell" title="unfinished">unfinisht</span> in the press, and hearing 
for certain that a Divine of note, out of his good will to the opinion, had <span class="varspell" title="taken">takn</span> it into his revise, 
and <span class="varspell" title="something">somthing</span> had put out, <span class="varspell" title="something">somthing</span> put in, and stuck it <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> and there with a clove of his own <span class="mi">Calligraphy</span>, to 
keep it from tainting, and <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span> when I saw the stuff, though very <span class="varspell" title="coarse">cours</span> and <span class="varspell" title="threadbare">thred-bare</span>, <span class="varspell" title="garnished">garnisht</span> and trimly 
<span class="varspell" title="faced">fac't</span> with the commendations of a <span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span>, I <span class="varspell" title="resolved">resolv'd</span>, so soon, as leisure granted <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> the 
recreation, that my man of Law should not altogether <span class="varspell" title="lose">loose</span> his <span class="varspell" title="soliciting">solliciting</span>. Although I impute a share of the making to him 
whose name I find in the approbation, who may take, as his mind <span class="varspell" title="serves">servs</span> <a href="" id="him" class="annotBtn">him</a>, this Reply. In the mean while it shall 
<span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> seen, I refuse no occasion, and avoid no adversary, either to <span class="varspell" title="maintain">maintane</span> what I have begun, or 
to give it up for better reason.</p>

<p>To begin then 
with the <span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span> and <a href="" id="Censure" class="annotBtn">his censure</a>. 
For a <span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span> is not contented now to give his single <a href="" id="imprimatur" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Imprimatur</span></a>, but brings his 
chair into the Title leaf; there sits and judges up or judges down what book <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> pleases; if this <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> 
<span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span>, what <span class="varspell" title="worthless">worthles</span> Author, or what cunning Printer will not <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> ambitious of such a <a href="" id="Stale" class="annotBtn">Stale</a> to put off the heaviest gear; which may in time bring in round fees 
to the <span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span>, and wretched <span class="varspell" title="misleading">mis-leading</span> to the People. But to the matter: he approves <span class="mi">the 
publishing of this Book, to <span class="varspell" title="preserve">preserv</span> the strength and <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> against those sad

in <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> to a remediless <a href="" id="thrall" class="annotBtn">thraldom</a>, is 
<span class="mi">the strength and <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span></span>; a boistrous and bestial strength, a <span class="varspell" title="dishonorable">dis-honourable</span> <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span>, an infatuated 
Doctrine, <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <a href="" id="salvo" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">salvo

discontents make these breaches in unstaid <span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span>, and men given to change</span>. His words may 
be apprehended, as if they <span class="varspell" title="disallowed">disallow'd</span> only to divorce for <span class="mi">common discontents in unstaid 
<span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span></span>, having no cause, but a <span class="mi">desire of change</span>, and then <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> agree. But if <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> take 
all discontents <span class="mi">on this side adultery</span>, to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> common, that is to say, not difficult to 
endure, and to affect only <span class="mi">unstaid <span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span></span>, it might administer just cause, to think him the 
unfittest man that could <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span>, to offer at a comment upon <span class="mi">Job</span>; as seeming by this to have 
no more true sense of a good man in his afflictions, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> those <a href="" id="friends" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Edomitish</span> <span class="varspell" title="Friends">Freinds</span></a> had, of whom <span class="mi">Job</span> complains, and 
against whom God testifies his anger. Shall a man of your own coat, who hath <span class="varspell" title="espoused">espous'd</span> his flock; 
and represents Christ more, in <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> the true husband of his Congregation, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> an <span class="varspell" title="ordinary">ordnary</span> man 
doth in <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> the husband of his wife, and yet this representment is thought a <span class="varspell" title="chief">cheif</span> cause why 
<span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> inseparable, shall this spiritual man <span class="varspell" title="ordinarily">ordnarily</span> for the increase of his

trivial fellow was accepted and commended, to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the confuter of so dangerous an opinion as 
yee give out mine.</p><p>

Now <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to 
your <a href="" id="atturney" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Attorney">Atturney</span></span></a>, since no 
worthier an adversary makes his appearance, nor this neither his appearance, but lurking under 
the safety of his <span class="varspell" title="nameless">nameles</span> obscurity: such as yee turn him forth at the <a href="" id="postern" class="annotBtn">Postern</a>, I must accept him, and in a

with his <span class="mi">Ulysses</span>.
</p>
<p><span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> begins with 
Law, and <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> have it of him as good cheap, as any <span class="varspell" title="huckster">hucster</span> at Law, newly set up, can possibly afford, and as impertinent; 
but for that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> hath <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> his <a href="" id="hansel" class="annotBtn">hansel</a>. <span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> presumes also to cite the Civil Law, which, I <span class="varspell" title="perceive">perceav</span> by 
his citing never came within his <span class="mi">dormitory</span>; yet what <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> cites, makes but against himself.
</p><p>His second thing 
<span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> is to refute the <span class="varspell" title="adverse">advers</span> position, and very methodically, three pages before <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> sets it 
down; and sets his own in the place, <span class="mi">that disagreement of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> or disposition</span>,
<span class="mi">though <span class="varspell" title="showing">shewing</span> it self in much <span class="varspell" title="sharpness">sharpnes</span> is not by the Law of God, or man, a just cause of 
divorce</span>.</p>
<p>To this position I 
answer, that it lays no battery against 
mine, no, nor so much as faces it, but tacks about, long ere it come <span class="varspell" title="near">neer</span>, like a <span class="varspell" title="harmless">harmles</span> and 
<span class="varspell" title="respectful">respectfull</span> confutement. For I confess that disagreement of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> or disposition, though in much 
<span class="varspell" title="sharpness">sharpnes</span>, is not <span class="varspell" title="always">alwaies</span> a just cause of divorce; for much may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="endured">endur'd</span>. But what if the 
<span class="varspell" title="sharpness">sharpnes</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> much more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> his much? To that point it is our <span class="varspell" title="mishap">mis-hap</span> <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> have not <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> his 
grave decision. <span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> that will contradict the positive which I <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span>, must hold that no 
disagreement of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>, or disposition, can divorce, though <span class="varspell" title="shown">shewn</span> in most <span class="varspell" title="sharpness">sharpnes</span>; otherwise 
<span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> leaves a place for equity to appoint limits, and so his following arguments will either not 
prove his own position, or not disprove mine. </p>

<p>His first 
Argument, all but what hobbles to no <span class="varspell" title="purpose">purpos</span> is this. <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Where">Wher</span> the Scripture commands a
thing to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, it appoints when, how, and for what, as in the case of death or 
excommunication. But the Scripture directs not what measure of disagreement or contrariety may 
divorce; <span class="varspell" title="Therefore">Therfore</span> the Scripture allows not any divorce for disagreement</span>.</p>

<p><span class="mi">Answer; </span>
First I deny your <a href="" id="major" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">major</span></a>, the Scripture appoints many things, and yet leaves the
circumstance to <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> discretion, particularly, in your own examples; Excommunication is not 
taught when, and for what to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span>, but left to the Church. How could the <span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span> let pass this childish ignorance and call it 
<span class="mi">good</span>. Next, in matter of death, the Laws of <span class="mi">England</span>, <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> you have intruded to 
<span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> an <a href="" id="opiniastrous" class="annotBtn">opiniastrous</a> <span class="mi">Sub advocate</span>, and are bound to 
defend them, <span class="varspell" title="conceive">conceave</span> it not <span class="varspell" title="enjoined">enjoyn'd</span> in Scripture, when or for what cause they shall put to 
death, as in adultery, theft, and the like; your <span class="mi">minor</span> also is <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span>, for the Scripture plainly 
sets down for what measure of disagreement a man may divorce, <a href="" id="deut24" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut</abbr></span>. 24. 1</a>. learn better what that phrase means, <span class="mi">if <span class="varspell" title="she">shee</span> 
<span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> no <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> in his eyes</span>.</p><p>Your second 
Argument, without more tedious fumbling is <span class="varspell" title="briefly">breifly</span> thus. <span class="mi">If diversity in Religion,
which breeds a greater dislike <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any natural disagreement may not cause a divorce, then may 
not the lesser disagreement: but diversity of Religion may not; Ergo</span>.</p>

<p><span class="mi">Answer</span>, 
First, I deny in the <span class="mi">major</span>, that diversity of Religion, breeds a greater dislike to <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> 
duties, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> natural disagreement. For between <span class="mi">Israelite</span>, or Christian and Infidel more 
often hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> seen too much love: but between them who perpetually clash in natural  
contrarieties, it is repugnant that <span class="varspell" title="there">ther</span> should <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> ever any <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> love or concord. Next, I deny 
your <span class="mi">minor</span>, that it is commanded not to divorce in diversity of Religion, if the Infidel will 
stay: for <a href="" id="thatplace" class="annotBtn">that place in <span class="mi"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> 
Paul</span></a>, commands nothing, as <span class="mi">that book</span> at large <span class="varspell" title="affirmed">affirm'd</span>, though you over-<span class="varspell" title="skipped">skipt</span> 
it. </p><p>Secondly, if it 
<span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> command, it is but with condition, that the Infidel <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> content, and well <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> to stay, 
which cuts off the supposal of any great hatred or disquiet between them; seeing the Infidel had 
liberty to depart at pleasure; and so this comparison avails nothing. </p>

<p>Your third 
Argument is from <a href="" id="deut22" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 22</a>. <span class="mi">If a 
man hate his wife, and raise an ill report, that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>
found her no virgin</span>, if this were <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span>, <span class="mi">he might not put her away</span>, though hated never 
so much. </p>

<p><span class="mi">Answer</span>, 
This was a malicious hatred, bent against her life, or to send her out of <span class="varspell" title="doors">dores</span> without her portion. 
Such a hater <span class="varspell" title="loses">looses</span> by due punishment that privilege, <a href="" id="deut24" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 24. 1</a>. to divorce for a natural dislike, which though it could not 
love conjugallly, yet sent away civilly, and with just conditions. But <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtles</span> the Wife in that 
former case had liberty to depart from her <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> accuser, lest his hatred should prove mortal; <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> 
that Law peculiarly made to right the woman, had <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> to her greatest <span class="varspell" title="mischief">mischeif</span>, </p>

<p>Your fourth 
Argument, <span class="mi">One Christian ought to bear the infirmities of another, but <span class="varspell" title="chiefly">cheifly</span> of his
Wife</span>.</p>

<p><span class="mi">Answer</span>, 
I grant, infirmities, but not outrages, nor perpetual defraudments of truest conjugal
society, not injuries and vexations as <span class="varspell" title="importunate">importunat</span> as fire. Yet to endure very much, might <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> well 
an exhortation, but not a compulsive Law. For the Spirit of God himself by <span class="mi">Solomon</span> declares that such a 
consort <span class="mi"><a href="" id="cannotbear" class="annotBtn">the earth cannot bear</a>, and better dwell in a corner on the house top, or in the 
<span class="varspell" title="Wilderness">Wildernes</span></span>. Burdens may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> born, but still with consideration to the strength of an honest 
man complaining.  Charity indeed bids us forgive our enemies, yet doth not force us to continue 
<span class="varspell" title="friendship">freindship</span> and familiarity with those <span class="varspell" title="friends">freinds</span> who have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> or unworthy towards us; but is 
contented in our peace with them, at a fair distance. Charity commands not the husband to <span class="varspell" title="receive">receav</span> 
again into his bosom the adulterous 
Wife, but thinks it <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, if he dismiss her with a beneficent and peaceful dismission. No 
more doth Charity command, nor can her rule compell, to retain in <span class="varspell" title="nearest">neerest</span> union of <span class="varspell" title="wedlock">wedloc</span>, one whose other grossest faults, 
or disabilities to perform what was <span class="varspell" title="covenanted">covnanted</span>, are the just causes of as much <span class="varspell" title="grievance">greevance</span> and 
dissension in a Family, as the private act of adultery. Let not <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> under the name of fulfilling 
Charity, such an <span class="varspell" title="unmerciful">unmercifull</span>, and more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> legal yoke, <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="padlocked">padlockt</span> upon the neck of any 
Christian.</p>

<p>Your fifth 
Argument, <span class="mi">If the husband ought love his Wife, <a href="" id="aschristhischurch" class="annotBtn">as Christ his Church</a>, then ought <span class="varspell" title="she">shee</span>
not to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> put away for contrariety of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span></span>.</p>

<p><span class="mi">Answer</span>, 
This similitude <span class="varspell" title="turns">turnes</span> against him. For if the husband must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> as Christ to the Wife, then must 
the wife <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> as the Church to her husband. If <span class="varspell" title="there">ther</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a perpetual contrariety of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> in the 
Church toward Christ, Christ <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> <span class="varspell" title="threatens">threat'ns</span> to divorce such a Spouse, and hath often <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> it. 
If they urge this was no true Church, I urge again, that was no true Wife.</p>

<p>His sixth 
Argument is from the <a href="" id="5matthew" class="annotBtn">5 of <span class="mi">Matthew</span> 
32</a>. which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> expounds after the old fashion, and never takes notice of what I brought 
against that exposition; Let him <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> seek his answer there. Yet can <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> not <span class="varspell" title="leave">leav</span> this 
Argument, but <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> must needs first <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us a <a href="" id="curvett" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="curvet">curvett</span></a> of his <span class="varspell" title="madness">madnes</span>, holding out an objection, and running himself 
upon the point. <span class="mi">For</span>, saith <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>, <span class="mi">if Christ except no Cause but Adultery, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> all other 
causes as frigidity, incestuous <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, &amp;c. are no causes of divorce</span>; and answers, <span class="mi">that 
the speech of Christ holds universally, as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> intended it namely to condemn such divorce; as 
was <span class="varspell" title="groundlessly">groundlesly</span> <span class="varspell" title="practiced">practiz'd</span> among the Jews, for every cause which they thought sufficient; not 
checking the law of consanguinities or affinities, or forbidding other cause which makes <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> 
void, Ipso facto</span>.</p>
<p><span class="mi">Answ</span>. 
Look to it now you be not found taking fees on both sides, for if you once bring
limitations to the universal words of Christ, another will <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> as much with as good <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>, and
affirm, that neither did <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> check the Law <a href="" id="deut24" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 24. 1</a>. nor forbid the causes that make <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> void actually; 
which if any thing in the world doth, <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> doth, and contrariety of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>; yea, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> 
adultery, for that makes not the <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> void, not much more unfit, but for the time, if the 
offended party forgive; but <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> and contrariety frustrates and nullifies for ever, unless it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> 
a rare chance, all the good and peace of wedded conversation; and leaves nothing between them 
enjoyable, but a prone and savage necessity, not worth the name of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, unaccompanied with 
love. Thus much his own objection hath <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> against himself. </p>

<p><span class="mi"><abbr title="Argument">Argu.</abbr> 7. </span>
<span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> insists, <span class="mi">that man and wife are one flesh, <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> must not <span class="varspell" title="separate">separat</span></span>. But must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> sent 
to look again upon the <a href="" id="page35" class="annotBtn">35. <abbr title="page">pag.</abbr> of that book</a>, where <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> might have read an answer, which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> 
<span class="varspell" title="stirs">stirrs</span> not. Yet can <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> not abstain, but <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> must <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> us another pleasure ere <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> goes; Although I 
call the Common Pleas to witness, I 
have not <span class="varspell" title="hired">hir'd</span> his tongue, whatever men 
may think by his arguing. For besides adultery, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> excepts <span class="mi">other causes which <span class="varspell" title="dissolve">dissolv</span> the 
union of <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> one flesh, either directly, or by consequence</span>. If only adultery <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> excepted 
by our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> voluntarily can <span class="varspell" title="add">adde</span> other exceptions that <span class="varspell" title="dissolve">dissolv</span> that union <span class="mi">both 
directly and by consequence</span>, these Words of Christ, the main obstacle of divorce, are open 
to us by his own invitation to include what ever causes <span class="varspell" title="dissolve">dissolv</span> that union of flesh, <span class="mi">either 
directly or by consequence</span>. Which, till <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> name other causes more likely, I affirm to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> 
soonest by unfitness and contrariety of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>. For that induces hatred, which is the greatest 
dissolver, both of spiritual and corporal union, turning the <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> and consequently the body to 
other objects. Thus our doubty 
adversary, <span class="mi">either directly, or by consequence</span> <span class="varspell" title="yields">yeilds</span> us the question with his own mouth, 
and the next thing <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> does, recants it again. </p>

<p>His eighth 
Argument shivers in the uttering, and 
<span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> confesses <span class="mi">to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> not over confident of it</span>; but of the rest it may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> sworn <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> is.  
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>, <a href="" id="trouble" class="annotBtn">1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor</abbr></span>. 7</a>. saith, that 
<span class="mi">the married have trouble in the flesh</span>, <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> must bear it, though never so 
intolerable. </p>

<p>I Answer, If this 
<span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a true consequence, why are not all troubles to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> born alike? why are <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> to 
divorce adulteries, desertions, or frigidities? Who knows not that trouble and affliction is the decree of God 
upon every state of life? follows it <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span>, that though they grow excessive, and insupportable, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> must 
not avoid them? if <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> may in all other conditions, and not in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, the doom of our suffering 
ties us not by the trouble, but by the bond of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>; and that must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> inseparable from 
other reasons, not from this place. And his own confession declares the <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknes</span> of this 
Argument, yet his <span class="varspell" title="ungoverned">ungovern'd</span> arrogance could not <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="dissuaded">disswaded</span> from venting it. </p>

<p>His ninth 
Argument is, <span class="mi">That a husband must love his wife as himself, <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> may not
divorce for any disagreement, no more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> may <span class="varspell" title="separate">separat</span> his soul from his 
body</span>.</p>

<p>I Answer, if <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> 
love his wife as himself, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> must love her so <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> may <span class="varspell" title="preserve">preserv</span> himself to her in a 
<span class="varspell" title="cheerful">cherfull</span> and comfortable manner, and not so as to ruin himself by anguish and sorrow, without 
any benefit to her. Next, if the husband must love his wife as himself, <span class="varspell" title="she">shee</span> must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> understood a 
wife in <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> reasonable measure, willing, and sufficient to perform the <span class="varspell" title="chief">cheif</span> duties of her 
<span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span>, <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> by the hold of this Argument, it would <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> his great sin to divorce either for adultery, or desertion. The rest of this 
will run circuit with the union of one flesh, which was <span class="varspell" title="anwered">answer'd</span> before. And that to divorce a 
relative and <span class="mi">Metaphorical</span> union of two bodies into one flesh, cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="likened">likn'd</span> in all 
things to the dividing of that natural union of soul and body into one person, is apparent of it 
self. </p>

<p>His last 
Argument <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> fetches <span class="mi">from the inconveniences that would follow upon this freedom of
divorce, to the corrupting of <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span> <span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span>, and the overturning of all human 
society</span>.</p>

<p>But for <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>, let 
God and <span class="mi">Moses</span> answer this blasphemer, who dares bring in such a foul <span class="varspell" title="indictment">endightment</span> against the divine Law. Why 
did God permit this to his people the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span>, but that the right and good which came directly 
<span class="varspell" title="thereby">therby</span>, was more in his esteem, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the wrong and evil which came by accident. And for those 
weak supposes of Infants that would be left in their <span class="varspell" title="mother's">mothers</span> belly, (which must needs <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> good 
news for Chamber-maids, to hear a Serving-man grown so provident for great bellies) and 
portions, and <span class="varspell" title="jointures">joyntures</span> likely to <span class="varspell" title="incur">incurr</span> 
<span class="varspell" title="embezzlement">imbezlement</span> <span class="varspell" title="hereby">heerby</span>, the ancient civil 
Law instructs us plentifully how to award, which our profound opposite knew not, for it 
was not in his <a href="" id="tenures" class="annotBtn">Tenures</a>. </p>

<p>His Arguments 
are spun, now follows the Chaplain with his Antiquities, wiser if <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> had <span class="varspell" title="refrained">refrain'd</span>, for his very 
touching <span class="varspell" title="aught">ought</span> that is <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span>, <span class="varspell" title="soils">soiles</span> it, and lays him still more and more open, a conspicuous gull. There <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> both <a href="" id="councels" class="annotBtn">Fathers and <span class="varspell" title="Councils">Councels</span> ></a>
more ancient, <span class="varspell" title="wherewith">wherwith</span> to have <span class="varspell" title="served">serv'd</span> his <span class="varspell" title="purpose">purpos</span> better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> with what <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> cites, how may we 
<span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> to know the <span class="varspell" title="subtle">suttle</span> drift that <span class="varspell" title="moved">mov'd</span> him to begin first with the <a href="" id="toledo" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">twelfth Council of Toledo?</span></a> I 
would not undervalue the depth of his notion, but perhaps he had heard that the men of 
<span class="mi">Toledo</span> had store of good blade-mettle, and were excellent at cuttling; who can tell but it might <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the 
reach of his policy, that these able men of decision, would <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> best to have the prime stroke 
among his testimonies in deciding this cause. But all this craft avails him not; forseeing they allow 
no cause of divorce but fornication, what <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> these keen Doctors <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> but cut him over the 
sinews with <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <a href="" id="toledos" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Toledos">Toledo's</span></a>, for holding in the precedent page other causes of divorce besides, 
<span class="mi">both directly, and by consequence</span>. As evil doth <a href="" id="saxon" class="annotBtn">that <span class="mi">Saxon</span> <span class="varspell" title="Council">Councel</span></a>, next 
quoted, bestead him. For if it allow divorce precisely for no cause but fornication, it thwarts his 
own Exposition: and if it understand fornication largely, it sides with whom <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> would confute. 
However, the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of that Synod can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> but small, <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> under <span class="mi">Theodorus</span>, the 
<span class="mi">Canterbury</span> Bishop, a Grecian Monk of the <span class="mi">Tarsus</span>, <a href="" id="theodore" class="annotBtn">revolted from his own Church</a> to the Pope. What have 
<span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> next? The <a href="" id="civillaw" class="annotBtn">Civil Law</a> <span class="varspell" title="stuffed">stufft</span> in between two <span class="varspell" title="Councils">Councels</span>, as if the <span class="mi">Code</span> had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> 
Synod; for that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> understood himself in this quotation is incredible; where the Law, <span class="mi">Cod. l</span>. 
3. <span class="mi">tit</span>. 38. <span class="mi">leg</span>. 11. speaks not of divorce, but against the dividing of possessions to <span class="varspell" title="diverse">divers</span> 
<span class="varspell" title="heirs">heires</span>, <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> the <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> servants of a great family were divided perhaps into distant Countries, 
and Colonies, Father from Son, Wife from Husband, sore against their will. <span class="varspell" title="Somewhat">Somwhat</span> lower <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> 
confesses, <span class="mi">that the Civil Law allows many reasons of divorce, but the Canon Law decrees 
otherwise</span>. A fair credit to his Cause; and I amaze me, though the fancy of this doubt <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> as 
obtuse and <a href="" id="mallet" class="annotBtn">sad as any mallet</a>, how the 
<span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span> could sleep out all this, and suffer him to uphold his opinion by Canons, &amp; 
<span class="mi">Gregorical decretals</span>, a Law 
which not only his adversary, but the whole reformation of this Church and state hath branded and rejected. As ignorantly, and 
too ignorantly to <span class="varspell" title="deceive">deceav</span> any Reader but an <span class="varspell" title="unlearned">unlerned</span>, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> talks of  <a href="" id="apology" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Justin Martyrs</span> Apology</a>, not 
telling us which of the twain; for that passage in the beginning of his first, which I have cited <span class="varspell" title="elsewhere">els-where</span>, plainly makes against him: So doth <a href="" id="tertullian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Tertullian</span></a>, cited next, and next <a href="" id="erasmus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Erasmus</span></a>, the one against 
<span class="mi">Marcion</span>, the other in his Annotations on <span class="mi">Matthew</span>, and to the 
<span class="mi">Corinthians</span>. And thus yee have the List of his choice Antiquities, as pleasantly chosen 
as yee would wish from a man of his handy Vocation, <span class="varspell" title="puffed">puft</span> up with no luck at all, above the stint of his capacity.
</p>

<p>
Now he comes to the Position, which I <span class="varspell" title="set">sett</span> down whole; and like an able <a href="" id="textman" class="annotBtn">text man</a>, slits it into <span class="varspell" title="four">fowr</span>, that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> may the better come at it with his <span class="varspell" title="Barber">Barbar</span> Surgery, and his sleeves <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> up.  <span class="varspell" title="Wherein">Wherin</span> first, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> denies <span class="mi">that any disposition, unfitness, or contrariety of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>, is unchangeable in nature, but that by the help of diet and physic, it may be <span class="varspell" title="altered">alterd</span></span>.</p>

<p>
I mean not to dispute Philosophy with this Pork, who never read any.  But I appeal to all experience, though there <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> many drugs to purge these redundant <span class="varspell" title="humors">humours</span> and circulations that commonly impair health, and are not natural, whether any man can with the safety of his life bring a healthy constitution into physic with this <span class="varspell" title="design">designe</span>, to alter his natural temperament and disposition of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>.  How much more vain, and ridiculous would it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span>, by altering and rooting up the grounds of nature, which is most likely to produce death or <span class="varspell" title="madness">madnes</span>, to hope the reducing of a <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> to this or that <span class="varspell" title="fitness">fitnes</span>, or two disagreeing <span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span> to a mutual sympathy.  Suppose they might, and that with great danger of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> lives and right senses, alter one <a href="" id="temperature" class="annotBtn">temperature</a>, how can they know that the succeeding disposition will not <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> as <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> from <span class="varspell" title="fitness">fitnes</span> and agreement?  They would perhaps change <a href="" id="humors" class="annotBtn">Melancholy into <span class="varspell" title="Sanguine">Sanguin</span></a>, but what if <span class="varspell" title="phlegm">fleam</span>, and choler in as great a measure come instead, the <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> will be still as difficult and <span class="varspell" title="troublesome">troublesom</span>.  But lastly, whether these things be changeable, or not, experience teacheth us, and our Position supposes that they seldom <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> change in any time commensurable to the necessities of man, or convenient to the ends of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>; and if the fault be in the one, shall the other live all his <span class="varspell" title="days">daies</span> in bondage and misery for <span class="varspell" title="another's">anothers</span> <span class="varspell" title="perverseness">perversnes</span>, or immedicable disaffection?  To my <span class="varspell" title="friends">freinds</span>, of which may fewest <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> so unhappy, I have a remedy, as they know, more wise and manly to prescribe: but for his <span class="varspell" title="friends">freinds</span> and followers (of which many may <span class="varspell" title="deserve">deserv</span> justly to feel <span class="varspell" title="themselves">themselvs</span> the <span class="varspell" title="unhappiness">unhappines</span> which they consider not in others) I send them by his advice to sit upon the stool and strain, till their cross dispositions and contrarieties of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> shall change to a better correspondence, and to a quicker apprehension of common sense, and <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own good.</p><p>


His second Reason is as heedless; <span class="mi">because that grace may change the disposition, <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> no indisposition may cause divorce</span>.</p><p>


<span class="mi">Answ. </span> First, it will not <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> deniable that many persons, gracious both, may yet happen to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> very unfitly <span class="varspell" title="married">marryed</span> to the great disturbance of either.  Secondly, what if one have grace, the other not, and will not alter, as the Scripture testifies <span class="varspell" title="there">ther</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> of those, in whom we may expect a change, when <span class="mi">the <span class="varspell" title="Blackamoor">Blackamore</span> changes his <span class="varspell" title="color">colour</span>, or the Leopard his Spots</span>, <a href="" id="leopardspots" class="annotBtn"><abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 13. 23</a>. shall the gracious <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> dwell in torment all his life, for the ungracious?  <span class="varspell" title="We">Wee</span> see that holiest precepts, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> which there can no better physic <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="administered">administerd</span> to the <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> of man, and set on with <span class="varspell" title="powerful">powerfull</span> preaching, cannot work this cure, no not in the family, not in the wife of him that Preaches day and night to her.  What an unreasonable thing it is, that men, and Clergy-men especially, should exact such wondrous changes in another <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> house, and are seen to work so little in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own?</p><p>


To the second point of the position, that this <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span></span> hinders the main ends, and benefits of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> answers, <span class="mi"> if I mean the <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> of choler, or sullen disposition, that soft words, according to Solomon, pacify wrath</span>.</p><p>


But I reply, that the saying of <span class="mi">Solomon</span> is <a href="" id="aproverb" class="annotBtn">a Proverb</a>, frequently true, not universally, as both the event <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span>, and many other sentences <span class="varspell" title="written">writtn</span> by the same Author, particularly of an <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> woman, <a href="" id="proverbs21" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Proverbs">Prov</abbr></span>. 21. 9, 19</a>.  and in other Chapters, that <span class="varspell" title="she">shee</span> is better <span class="varspell" title="shunned">shunn'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> dwelt with, and a desert is <span class="varspell" title="preferred">preferr'd</span> before her society.  What need the Spirit of God put this <span class="varspell" title="choice">chois</span> into our heads, if soft words could <span class="varspell" title="always">alwaies</span> take effect with her?  How frivolous is, not only this disputer, but <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> that taught him thus, and let him come abroad.</p><p>


To his second answer I return this, that although there <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> not easily found such an <span class="mi">antipathy, as to hate one another like a toad or poison</span>, yet that there is oft such a dislike in both, or either, to conjugal love, as hinders all the comfort of Matrimony, scars any can be so simple as not to apprehend.  And what can be <span class="mi">that <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span>, found</span> or not found, <span class="mi">in the eyes of the Husband</span>, but a natural liking or disliking; <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> the Law of God, <a href="" id="deut24" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr></span> 24.</a> <span class="varspell" title="bears">beares</span> <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnes</span>, as of an <span class="varspell" title="ordinary">ordnary</span> accident, and <span class="varspell" title="determines">determins</span> wisely and divinely <span class="varspell" title="thereafter">therafter</span>.  And this disaffection <span class="varspell" title="happening">happning</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> in the one, not without the unspeakable discomfort of the other, must <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> left like a thing consecrated to calamity and despair without redemption?</p><p>


Against the third branch of the position, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> denies <span class="mi">that solace, and peace, which is contrary to discord and variance, is the main end of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span></span>.  What then?  <span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> will have it<span class="mi"> the solace of male and female</span>.  Came this <span class="varspell" title="doctrine">doctrin</span> out of <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> School or some <span class="varspell" title="sty">stie</span>?  Who but one <span class="varspell" title="forsaken">forsak'n</span> of all sense and civil nature, and <span class="varspell" title="chiefly">cheifly</span> of Christianity, will deny that peace, contrary to discord, is the calling and the general end of every Christian, and of all his actions, and more especially of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, which is the dearest league of love, and the dearest resemblance of that love which in Christ is dearest to his Church;  how then can peace and comfort, as it is contrary to discord, which God hates to dwell with, not <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the main end of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>?  Discord then <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> ought to fly, and to pursue peace, <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> above the observance of a civil <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> already <span class="varspell" title="broken">brokn</span>, and the breaking <span class="varspell" title="daily">dayly</span> iterated on the other side.  And what better testimony <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="" id="institution" class="annotBtn">the words of the institution it self</a>, to prove that a conversing solace, &amp; peaceful society, is the prime end of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, without which no other help or office can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> mutual, beseeming the dignity of reasonable creatures, that such as they should be <span class="varspell" title="coupled">coupl'd</span> in the rites of nature by the <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> compulsion of lust, without love or peace, <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> wild beasts.  Nor was it half so wisely <span class="varspell" title="spoken">spokn</span> as some deem, though <a href="" id="austin" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Augustine">Austin</span></span> spake it</a>, that if God had intended other <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> copulation in <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span>, he would for <span class="mi">Adam</span> have created a <span class="varspell" title="Friend">Freind</span>, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a wife, to <span class="varspell" title="converse">convers</span> with; and our own writers blame him for this opinion; for which and the like passages, concerning <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> might <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> justly taxed of rusticity in these affairs.  For this cannot but <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> with ease <span class="varspell" title="conceived">conceav'd</span>, that there is one society of grave <span class="varspell" title="friendship">freindship</span>, and another amiable and attractive society of conjugal love, besides the deed of procreation, which of itself soon <span class="varspell" title="cloys">cloies</span>, and is <span class="varspell" title="despised">despis'd</span>, unless it be <span class="varspell" title="cherished">cherisht</span> and  re-incited with a pleasing conversation. Which if ignoble and <a href="" id="swainish" class="annotBtn">swainish</a> <span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span> cannot apprehend, shall such merit <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to be the censurers of more generous and <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> Spirits?</p><p>


Against the last point of the position, to prove that contrariety of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> is not a greater cause of divorce <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> corporal frigidity, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> enters into such a <a href="" id="rationalburning" class="annotBtn">tedious and drawling tale of <span class="mi">burning</span></a>,<span class="mi"> and burning, and lust and burning</span>, that the dull argument it self <span class="varspell" title="burns">burnes</span> <span class="varspell" title="too">to</span>, for want of stirring; and yet all this burning is not able to expell the frigidity of his brain.  So long <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> as that cause in the position shall <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> a sufficient cause of divorce, rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> spend words with this <span class="varspell" title="phlegmy">fleamy</span> <span class="varspell" title="clod">clodd</span> of an <span class="mi">Antagonist</span>, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> of necessity and a little merriment, I will not now contend whether it <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a greater cause <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> frigidity, or no.</p><p>


His next attempt is upon the Arguments which I brought to prove the position.  And for the first, not finding it of that structure as to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="scaled">scal'd</span> with his short ladder, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> retreats with a bravado, that it <span class="varspell" title="deserves">deservs</span> no answer.  And as I much wonder what the whole book <span class="varspell" title="deserved">deserv'd</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> thus <span class="varspell" title="troubled">troubl'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="solicited">sollicited</span> by such a paltry <span class="varspell" title="Soliciter">Sollicitor</span>.  I would <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> had not cast the gracious eye of his duncery upon the small deserts of a <span class="varspell" title="pamphlet">pamflet</span>, whose every line <span class="varspell" title="meddled">meddl'd</span> with, uncases him to scorn and laughter.</p><p>


That which he takes for the second Argument, if <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> look better, is no argument, but an induction to those that follow.  Then <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> stumbles that I should say, the gentlest ends of <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span>, confessing that he understands it not.  And I <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleev</span> him heartily: for how should <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>, a Servingman both by nature and by function, an Idiot by breeding, and a <span class="varspell" title="Soliciter">Sollicitor</span> by presumption, ever come to know, or feel within himself what the meaning is of gentle?  He blames it for <span class="mi">a neat phrase</span>, for nothing angers him more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> his own proper contrary.  Yet altogether without art sure <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> is not; for who could have <span class="varspell" title="devised">devis'd</span> to give us more <span class="varspell" title="briefly">breifly</span> a better description of his own Servility?</p><p>


But what will become now of the <span class="varspell" title="business">busines</span> I know not; for the man is suddenly taken with a lunacy of Law, and speaks revelations out of the <a href="" id="academy" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Attorneys">Atturneys</span> Academy</span></a> only from a lying spirit: for <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="says">saies</span>, that <span class="mi">where a thing is void</span>, ipso facto,<span class="mi"> there needs no legal proceeding to make it void</span>. Which is <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span>, for <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is void by adultery or frigidity, yet not made void without legal proceeding. Then asks my opinion of <span class="mi"><a href="" id="nokes" class="annotBtn">John a Nokes</a> and John a Stiles</span>; and I answer him, that I for my part think <span class="mi"><a href="" id="dory" class="annotBtn">John Dory</a></span>, was a better man <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> both of them: for certainly they were the greatest wranglers that ever <span class="varspell" title="lived">liv'd</span>, and have <span class="varspell" title="filled">fill'd</span> all our Law-books with the obtunding story of their suits and trials.</p><p>


After this <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> tells a miraculous <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of antiquity, how two <span class="mi">Romans, Titus and Sempronius, made feoffments</span>, at <span class="mi">Rome</span> sure, and<span class="mi"> levied Fines</span> by the Common Law.  But now his fit of Law past, yet hardly come to himself, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> maintains, that if <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> void, as <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> neither of God nor nature, <span class="mi">there needs no legal proceeding to part it</span>, and I tell him that offends not <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>; <span class="mi">Then</span>, quoth <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>,<span class="mi"> this is no thing to your book, <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> the <span class="varspell" title="Doctrine">Doctrin</span> and Discipline of Divorce</span>.  But that I deny him; for all Discipline is not legal, that is to say, juridical, but <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> is personal, <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> Economical, and <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> Ecclesiastical.
Lastly, if I prove that contrary dispositions are <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> neither of God nor nature, and so the <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> void, <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> will give <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> the controversy</span>.  I have <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> it in that book to any wise man, and without more <span class="varspell" title="ado">adoe</span> the Institution proves it.</p><p>


Where I answer an Objection usually made, that the disposition ought to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> known before <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> how difficult it is to choose a fit consort, and how <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> to mistake; the Servitor would know what I mean by conversation, declaring his capacity nothing <span class="varspell" title="refined">refin'd</span> since his Law-puddering, but still the same it was in the Pantry, and at the Dresser.  Shall I argue of conversation with this <span class="varspell" title="hoyden">hoyd'n</span>, to go and practice at his opportunities in the Larder?  To men of quality I have said <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>; and experience confirms by daily example that wisest, sobrest, justest Men are <span class="varspell" title="sometimes">somtimes</span> miserably <span class="varspell" title="mistaken">mistak'n</span> in their <span class="varspell" title="choice">chois</span>.  Whom to <span class="varspell" title="leave">leav</span> thus without remedy, <span class="varspell" title="tossed">tost</span> and tempested in a most unquiet sea of afflictions and temptations, I say is most unchristianly.</p><p>

But <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> goes on to untruss my Arguments, imagining them his <span class="varspell" title="Master's">Maisters</span> points.  Only in the passage following, I cannot but admire the <span class="varspell" title="ripeness">ripenes</span>, and the <span class="varspell" title="pregnancy">pregnance</span> of his native trechery, endeavouring to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> more a Fox <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> his wit will suffer him.  <span class="varspell" title="Whereas">Wheras</span> I <span class="varspell" title="briefly">breifly</span> <span class="varspell" title="mentioned">mention'd</span> certain heads of <span class="varspell" title="Discourse">Discours</span>, which I <span class="varspell" title="referred">referr'd</span> to a place more proper according to my method, to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> treated there at full with all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> Reasons about them, this Brain-worm against all the Laws of Dispute, will needs deal with them <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span>.  And as a Country <span class="varspell" title="Hind">Hinde</span> <span class="varspell" title="sometimes">somtimes</span> ambitious to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> his betters that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> is not so simple as you take him, and that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> knows his advantages, will teach us a new trick to confute by.  And would you think to what a pride <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> swells in the contemplation of his rare stratagem, offering to carp at the language of a book, which yet <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> confesses to be generally commended; while himself will <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="acknowledged">acknowledg'd</span> by all that read him, the basest and the hungriest <span class="varspell" title="indicter">endighter</span>, that could take the <span class="varspell" title="boldness">boldnes</span> to look abroad.  <span class="varspell" title="Observe">Observ</span> now the arrogance of a groom, how it will mount.  I had <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span>, that common adultery is a thing which the rankest Politician would think it shame and disworship that his Law should countenance.  First, it offends him that rankest should signify ought but his own smell; who that knows <span class="mi">English</span> would not understand <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>, when I say a rank Serving-man, a rank petti-fogger, to mean a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> Serving-man, a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> and arrant petti-fogger, who lately was so hardy, as to lay aside his buckram wallet, and make himself a fool in Print, with confuting books which are above him.  Next, the word Politician is not <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> to his maw, and <span class="varspell" title="thereupon">therupon</span> he plays the most notorious <span class="varspell" title="hobbyhorse">hobbihors</span>, jesting and frisking in the luxury of his <span class="varspell" title="nonsense">non-sense</span> with such poor fetches to cog a laughter from us, that no antic <span class="varspell" title="hobnail">hobnaile</span> at a Morris, but is more <span class="varspell" title="handsomely">hansomly</span> facetious.</p><p>


Concerning that place <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 24. 1. which he saith to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="mi">the main pillar of my opinion</span>, though I rely more on the institution <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> on that. These two pillars I <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> indeed confess are to <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> as those two in the porch of the Temple, <span class="mi">Jachin</span> and <span class="mi">Boaz</span> , which names import establishment and strength; nor <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> I fear who can shake them.  The exposition of <span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut</abbr></span>. which I brought, is the <span class="varspell" title="received">receav'd</span> Exposition, both ancient and modern, by all <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> men, unless it be a monkish papist <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> and there: and the gloss which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> and his obscure assistant would <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> us to, is <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> new, and absurd, presuming out of his utter ignorance in the <span class="varspell" title="Hebrew">Ebrew</span>, to interpret these words of the Text, first, in a <span class="varspell" title="Hebrew">mistakn</span> sense of <span class="mi">uncleanness</span>, against all approved Writers.  Secondly, in a limited sense, when as the original speaks without limitation, <span class="mi">some uncleanness</span><span class="mi">, or any</span>; and it had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> a wise Law indeed to mean itself particular, and not to express the case which this acute <span class="varspell" title="Rabbi">Rabbie</span> hath all this while <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> hooking for. <span class="varspell" title="Whereby">Wherby</span> they who are most partial to him may guess that <span class="varspell" title="something">somthing</span> is in this <span class="varspell" title="doctrine">doctrin</span> which I allege, that forces the adversary to such a new &amp; strained Exposition, <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> does nothing for above <span class="varspell" title="four">foure</span> pages, but founder himself to and fro in his own objections; one while denying <span class="mi">that divorce was permitted</span>, another while affirming <span class="mi">that it was permitted for the <span class="varspell" title="wife's">wives</span> sake</span>. and after all distrusts himself.  And for his surest retirement, betakes him to those old suppositions,<span class="mi"> that Christ <span class="varspell" title="abolished">abolisht</span> the Mosaic Law of divorce; that the Jews had not sufficient knowledge in this point, through the <span class="varspell" title="darkness">darknes</span> of the dispensation of heavenly things; that under the plenteous grace of the Gospel, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> are <span class="varspell" title="tied">ty'd</span> by cruellest compulsion to live in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> till death, with the wickedest, the worst, the most persecuting Mate</span>.  These ignorant and doting surmises he might have read confuted at large, <span class="varspell" title="even">eevn</span> in the first Edition, but found it safer to pass that part over in silence.  So that they who see not the sottishness of this his new and tedious Exposition, are worthy to love it dearly.</p><p>


His Explanation done, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> charges <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> with a <span class="mi">wicked gloss, and almost blasphemy</span>, for saying that Christ in teaching, meant not always to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> word for word; but like a wise Physician, administring one excess against another, to reduce us to a perfect mean.  Certainly to teach thus, were no dishonest method: <a name="ethics">Christ</a> himself hath often <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> <span class="mi">hyperbolies</span> in his teaching; and gravest Authors, both <span class="mi">Aristotle</span> in the second of his <span class="mi">Ethics</span> to <span class="mi">Nichomachus</span>, and <span class="mi">Seneca</span> in his seventh <span class="mi">De Beneficiis</span>, advise us to stretch out the line of precept oft times beyond measure, that while <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> tend <span class="varspell" title="further">furder</span>, the mean might <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the easier <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span>.  And <span class="varspell" title="whoever">who-ever</span> comments that fifth of <span class="mi">Matthew</span>, when <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> comes to the<span class="mi"> turning of cheek after cheek to blows</span>, and the <span class="mi">parting both with cloak and coat</span>, if any please to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> the rifler, will <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> to recommend himself to the same Exposition, though this chattering Law-monger <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> bold to call it <span class="mi">wicked</span>.  Now note another precious <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of him; <span class="mi">Christ, saith <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>, doth not say that an <span class="varspell" title="unchaste">unchast</span> look is adultery, but the lusting after her</span>; as if the looking <span class="varspell" title="unchastely">unchastly</span> could <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> without lusting.  This gear is <span class="varspell" title="licensed">Licenc't</span> for good reason: <span class="mi">Imprimatur</span>.</p><p>

Next <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> would prove that the speech of Christ is not <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utter'd</span> in excess against the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>, First, <span class="mi">Because <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> speaks it to his Disciples, <abbr title="Matthew">Matth.</abbr></span> 5. which is <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span>, for <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> spake it to the multitude, as by the first <span class="mi"><abbr title="verse">vers.</abbr></span> is evident, among which in all likelihood were many <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>, but out of doubt, all of them Pharisean disciples, and bred up in their <span class="varspell" title="Doctrine">Doctrin</span>; from which extremes of error and falsity, Christ throughout his whole Sermon <span class="varspell" title="labours">labours</span> to reclaim the people.  Secondly, saith he, <span class="mi">Because Christ <span class="varspell" title="forbids">forbidds</span> not only putting away, but marrying her who is put away</span>.  Acutely, as if the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> might not have offended as much in marrying the <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc'd</span>, as in divorcing the <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span>.  The recept may bind all, rightly understood; and yet the vehement manner of giving it, may be <span class="varspell" title="occasioned">occasion'd</span> only by the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>.</p><p>


Finally, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="winds">windes</span> up his Text with much doubt and trepidation; for it may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> his trenchers were not <span class="varspell" title="scraped">scrap'd</span>, and that which never yet afforded corn of <span class="varspell" title="savor">savour</span> to his noddle, the Salt-seller was not <span class="varspell" title="rubbed">rubb'd</span>: and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> in this <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="haste">hast</span> easily granting, that his answers fall <span class="varspell" title="foul">foule</span> upon each other</span>, and praying, you would not think<span class="mi"> he writes as a <span class="varspell" title="prophet">profet</span>, but as a man</span>, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="runs">runns</span> to the black jack, fills his flagon, <span class="varspell" title="spreads">spreds</span> the table, and <span class="varspell" title="serves">servs</span> up dinner.</p><p>


After waiting and voiding, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> thinks to void my second Argument, and the contradictions that will follow, both in the Law and Gospel, if the <span class="mi">Mosaic</span> Law were abrogated by our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>, and a compulsive prohibition <span class="varspell" title="fixed">fixt</span> instead: and sings his old song, <span class="mi">that the Gospel counts <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span> that which the Law <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span>,</span> instancing in <span class="mi">Circumcision, Sacrifices, Washings</span>.  But what are these Ceremonial things to the changing of a <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> point in <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span>, equally belonging to Jew and Gentile;  divorce was then right, now wrong, then permitted in the rigorous time of Law, now <span class="varspell" title="forbidden">forbidd'n</span> by Law, <span class="varspell" title="even">eevn</span> to the most extremely afflicted, in the <span class="varspell" title="favorable">favourable</span> time of grace and freedom.  But this is not for an <span class="varspell" title="unbuttoned">unbutton'd</span> fellow to discuss in the Garret at his tressle, and dimension of candle by the <span class="varspell" title="snuff">snuffe</span>; which brought forth his cullionly paraphrase on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>, whom he brings in, discoursing such idle stuff to the <span class="mi">Maids, and <span class="varspell" title="Widows">Widdows</span></span>, as his own servile inurbanity <span class="varspell" title="forbears">forbeares</span> not to put into the <span class="varspell" title="Apostle's">Apostles</span> mouth, <span class="mi">of the <span class="varspell" title="soul's">soules</span> conversing</span>: and this <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> presumes to do, being a bayard, who never had the soul to know, what conversing means, but as his provender, and the familiarity of the Kitchen <span class="varspell" title="schooled">school'd</span> his conceptions.</p><p>

<span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> passes to the third Argument, like a Boar in a <span class="varspell" title="Vineyard">Vinyard</span>, doing nought <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span>, but still as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> goes champing and chewing over, what I could mean by this <span class="mi">Chimera</span> of a fit conversing Soul, notions and words never made for those <span class="varspell" title="chops">chopps</span>; but like a generous Wine, only by overworking the <span class="varspell" title="settled">settl'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="mud">mudd</span> of his fancy, to make him drunk, and disgorge his vileness the more openly.  All persons of gentle breeding (I say gentle, though this Barrow grunt at the word) I know will apprehend, and <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="satisfied">satisfy'd</span> in what I spake, how unpleasing and discontenting the society of body must needs be between those whose <span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span> cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> sociable.  But what should a man say more to a snout in this pickle,  what language can be low and <span class="varspell" title="degenerate">degenerat</span> <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>?</p><p>

The fourth Argument which I had, was, that <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> a <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span>, the very <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> consists in the performance of unfeigned love and peace, if that were not tolerably <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</span>, the <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> became broke and revocable.  Which how can any in whose <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> the principles of right reason and justice are not <span class="varspell" title="cancelled">cancell'd</span>, deny;  for how can a thing subsist, when the true essence <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> is <span class="varspell" title="dissolved">dissolv'd</span>?  yet this <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> denies, and yet in such a manner as alters my assertion, for <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> puts in, <span class="mi">though the main end <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> not <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span> in full measure</span>: but my position is, if it be not tolerably <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span>, as throughout the whole <span class="varspell" title="discourse">Discours</span> is apparent.</p><p>

Now for his Reasons; <span class="mi">Heman found not that peace and solace which is the main end of communion with God, should <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> break off that communion?</span></p><p>

I answer, that if <span class="mi">Heman</span> found it not, the fault was certainly his own: but in <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> it <span class="varspell" title="happens">happns</span> <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> otherwise: <span class="varspell" title="Sometimes">Somtimes</span> the fault is plainly not his who seeks Divorce: <span class="varspell" title="Sometimes">Somtimes</span> it cannot be <span class="varspell" title="discerned">discern'd</span> whose fault it is: and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> cannot in reason or equity be the matter of an absolute prohibition. </p><p>

His other instance declares, what a right handicrafts man <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> is of petty cases, and how <span class="varspell" title="unfit">unfitt</span> to be ought <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> at highest, but a <span class="varspell" title="hackney">hacney</span> of the Law.  <span class="mi">I change houses with a man; it is <span class="varspell" title="supposed">suppos'd</span> I <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> it for my own ends; I attain them not in this house; I shall not <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> from my bargain</span>.  How without fear might the young <span class="mi">Charinus</span> in <span class="mi">Andria</span> now cry out<span class="mi">, what <span class="varspell" title="likeness">likenes</span> can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> to a <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span>?</span>  In this bargain was no capitulation, but the <span class="varspell" title="yielding">yeilding</span> of possession to one another, <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> each of them had his several end apart: in <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> there is a solemn vow of love and fidelity each to other: this bargain is fully <span class="varspell" title="accomplished">accomplisht</span> in the change; In <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> still is in performing. If one of them perform nothing tolerably, but instead of love, abound in disaffection, disobedience, fraud, and hatred, what thing in the nature of a <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> shall bind the other to such a perdurable <span class="varspell" title="mischief">mischeif</span>?  Keep to your <span class="varspell" title="Problems">Problemes</span> of ten groats, these matters are not for pragmatics, and folkmooters to babble in.</p><p>

Concerning the place of <span class="mi">Paul</span>, that<span class="mi"> God hath <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> us to peace</span>, 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 7. and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> certainly, if any where in this world, <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> have a right to claim it reasonably in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, it is plain <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> in the sense which I gave, and <span class="varspell" title="confessed">confess'd</span> by <span class="mi">Par&aelig;us</span>, and other Orthodox Divines, to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a good sense, and this Answerer, doth not <span class="varspell" title="weaken">weak'n</span> it. The other place, <span class="mi">that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> who hateth, may put away</span>, which, if I <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> him, he promises to <span class="varspell" title="yield">yeild</span> the whole <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span>, is, besides, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr></span> 24. 1. <span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr></span> 21. 14. and before this, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr></span> 21. 8.  Of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Malachi">Malachy</span></span>  I have <span class="varspell" title="spoken">spok'n</span> more in another place; and say again that the best interpreters, all the ancient, and most of the modern translate it, as I cited, and very few otherwise, <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> perhaps <span class="mi">Junius</span> is the <span class="varspell" title="chief">cheif</span>.
</p><p>

Another thing troubles him, that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> the mystery of Joy.  Let it still trouble him; for what hath <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> either with joy or with mystery?  He thinks it <span class="mi">frantic divinity</span> to say, It is not the outward continuance of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, that keeps the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> whole, but whosoever doth most according to peace and love, whether in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> or divorce, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> breaks <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="least">lest</span>.  If I shall spell it to him, <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> breaks <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="least">lest</span></span>, is to say, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="dishonors">dishonours</span> not <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>; for <span class="mi">least</span> is <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> in the Bible, and other good Authors, for, <span class="mi">not at all</span>.  And a particular <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> a man may break, if for a <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> cause, and yet not break, that is, not violate, or <span class="varspell" title="dishonor">dishonour</span> the <span class="varspell" title="Ordinance">Ordnance</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span>.  Hence these two questions that follow, are left ridiculous; and the <span class="mi">Maids at Algate</span>, whom <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> flouts, are likely to have more <span class="varspell" title="wit">witt</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Servingman at Addlegate.</p><p>

<span class="varspell" title="Whereas">Wheras</span> <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> taxes me of adding to the Scripture in that I said, Love only is the fulfilling of every Commandment, I cited no particular Scripture, but spake a general sense, which might <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> collected from many places.  For seeing love includes Faith, what is <span class="varspell" title="there">ther</span> that can <span class="varspel" title="fulfil">fulfill</span> every Commandment but only love?  And I meant, as any intelligent Reader might apprehend, every positive and civil commandment, <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> Christ hath taught us that <span class="mi">man is the Lord</span>.  It is not the formal duty of worship, or the sitting still, that keeps the holy rest of Sabbath; but whosoever doth most according to charity, whether <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> work or work not; he breaks the holy rest of Sabbath least.  So <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> a civil Ordinance made for man, not man for it; <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> who doth that which most accords with charity, first to himself, next to whom <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> next <span class="varspell" title="owes">ows</span> it, whether in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> or divorce, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> breaks the Ordinance of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> least.  And what in Religious prudence can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> charity to himself, and what to his Wife, either in continuing, or in dissolving the <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> knot, hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> already oft <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> <span class="varspell" title="discoursed">discours'd</span>.  So that what <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span> saith of circumcision, the same I stick not to say of a civil ordinance, made to the good and comfort of man, not to his ruin; <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is nothing, and divorce is nothing, <span class="mi">but faith, which worketh by love</span>.  And this I trust none can mistake.</p><p>

Against the fifth Argument, That a Christian in a higher order of <span class="varspell" title="Priesthood">Priest-hood</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that Levitical, is a person <span class="varspell" title="dedicate">dedicat</span> to joy and peace; and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> needs not in Subjection to a civil Ordinance, made to no other end but for his good, (when without his fault he <span class="varspell" title="finds">finde</span>s it impossible to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> decently or tolerably <span class="varspell" title="observed">observ'd</span>) to plunge himself into immeasurable distractions and temptations, above his strength; against this <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> proves nothing, but <span class="varspell" title="gads">gadds</span> into silly conjectures of what abuses would follow, and with as good reason might declaim against the best things that are.</p>
<p>
Against the sixth Argument, that to force the continuance of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> between <span style="varspell" title="minds">mindes</span> found utterly unfit and disproportional, is against nature, and seems <span class="varspell" title="forbid">forbidd</span> under that <span class="mi">allegorical</span> precept of <span class="mi">Moses</span>,<span class="mi"> Not to sow a field with <span class="varspell" title="diverse">divers</span> seeds, lest both <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="defiled">defil'd</span>, not to plough with an <span class="varspell" title="Ox">Oxe</span> and an Ass together</span>, which I <span class="varspell" title="deduced">deduc'd</span> by the pattern of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paul's">Pauls</span></span> reasoning what was meant <span class="mi">by not muzzling the <span class="varspell" title="Ox">Oxe</span></span>, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> rambles over a long narration, to tell us that by <span class="mi">the Oxen are meant the Preachers</span>: which is not doubted.  Then <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> demands, <span class="mi">if this my reasoning <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pauls</span>: and I answer him, yes.  <span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> replies, that <span class="mi">sure <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul would <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="ashamed">asham'd</span> to reason thus</span>.  And I tell him, No.  <span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> grants that place which I <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alleg'd</span>, 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 6. of unequal yoking,<span class="mi"> may allude to that of Moses</span>, but <span class="varspell" title="says">saies</span>,<span class="mi"> I cannot prove it makes to my <span class="varspell" title="purpose">purpos</span></span>, and <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> not first how <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> can disprove it.  <span class="varspell" title="Weigh">Waigh</span> Gentlemen, and consider, whether my affirmations, <span class="varspell" title="backed">backt</span> with Reason, may hold balance against the bare denials of this ponderous confuter, elected by his ghostly Patrons to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> my copes-mate.</p>
<p>
Proceeding on to speak of mysterious things in nature, I had occasion to fit the language <span class="varspell" title="thereafter">therafter</span>, matters not for the reading of this odious fool, who thus ever when he meets with <span class="varspell" title="aught">ought</span> above the cogitation of his breeding, <span class="varspell" title="leaves">leavs</span> the <span class="varspell" title="noisome">noysom</span> stench of his rude slot behind him, maligning that any thing should <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> spoke or understood above his own <span class="mi">genuine</span> <span class="varspell" title="baseness">basenes</span>; and gives sentence that his confuting hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="employed">employ'd</span> about <span class="mi">a frothy, immeritous and undeserving <span class="varspell" title="discourse">discours</span></span>.  Who could have <span class="varspell" title="believed">beleevd</span> so much insolence durst vent it self from out the hide of a varlet, as thus to censure that which men of mature judgement have applauded to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> writ with good reason.  But this contents him not, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> falls now to rave in his barbarous abusivenes; and why?  a reason befitting such an Artificer, because he saith<span class="mi"> the Book is contrary to all human <span class="varspell" title="learning">lerning</span></span>; When as the World knows that all, both human and divine <span class="varspell" title="learning">lerning</span>, till the Canon Law, <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> divorce by consent, and for many causes without consent.  Next, he dooms it, <span class="mi">as contrary to Truth</span>; when as it hath been disputable among <span class="varspell" title="learned">lerned</span> men, ever since it was prohibited: and is by <span class="mi">Peter Martyr</span> thought an<span class="mi"> opinion not impious</span>,<span class="mi"> but hard to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> refuted</span>; and by <span class="mi">Erasmus</span> <span class="varspell" title="deemed">deem'd</span> a <span class="varspell" title="Doctrine">Doctrin</span> <span class="mi">so charitable and pious, as, if it cannot <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, were to be <span class="varspell" title="wished">wisht</span> it could</span>; but is by <span class="mi">Martin Bucer</span>, a Man of dearest and most religious memory in the Church, taught and <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintain'd</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> either most lawfully <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, or most lawfully permitted.  And for this, for I affirm no more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="mi">Bucer</span>, what censure <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> you think, Readers, he hath <span class="varspell" title="condemned">condemn'd</span> the Book to?  To a death no less infamous <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="mi">to be <span class="varspell" title="burned">burnt</span> by the hangman</span>.  Mr. <span class="varspell" title="Licenser">Licencer</span>, for I deal not now with this caitif, never worth my earnest, &amp; now not seasonable for my jest, you are reputed a man discreet <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, religious <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, honest <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, that is, to an ordinary competence in all these.  But now your turn is, to hear what your own hand hath <span class="varspell" title="earned">earn'd</span> ye, that when you <span class="varspell" title="suffered">suffer'd</span> this <span class="varspell" title="nameless">nameles</span> hangman to cast into public such a <span class="varspell" title="despiteful">despightfull</span> contumely upon a name and person deserving of the Church and State equally to your self, and one who hath <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> more to the present advancement of your own Tribe, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> you or many of them have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> for <span class="varspell" title="themselves">themselvs</span>; you forgot to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> either honest, Religious, or discreet.  What ever the State might <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> concerning it, <span class="varspell" title="supposed">suppos'd</span> a matter to expect <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> from, I should not doubt to meet among them with wise, and <span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span>, and knowing men.  But as to this brute Libel, so much the more impudent and lawless for the <span class="varspell" title="abused">abus'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> which it bears, I say again, that I <span class="varspell" title="abominate">abominat</span> the censure of Rascals and their <span class="varspell" title="Licensers">Licencers</span>.</p><p>

With difficulty I return to what remains of this ignoble task, for the disdain I have to change a period more with the filth and venom of this gourmand, <span class="varspell" title="swelled">swell'd</span> into a confuter. Yet, for the satisfaction of others, I endure all this.</p>
<p>
Against the seventh Argument, that if the Canon Law and Divines allow divorce for conspiracy of death, they may as well allow it to avoid the same consequence from the likelihood of <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> causes;</p>
<p>
First, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> denies that the Canon so decrees.</p>
<p>
I Answer, that it decrees for danger of life, as much as for adultery, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Decretales">Decret.</abbr> <abbr title="Gregorii">Gregor</abbr></span>. l. 4. <span class="mi"><abbr title="titulus">tit</abbr></span>. 19. and in other places: and the best Civilians who cite the Canon Law, so collect, as <span class="mi">Schneidewin</span><span class="mi"> in <abbr title="Institutionum">Institut.</abbr> <abbr title="titulus">tit</abbr></span>. 10. <span class="mi">p</span>. 4<span class="mi">. de <abbr title="divorcionem">divort.</abbr></span>  and indeed, who would have <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> it, but one of a reprobate ignorance in all <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> meddles with.</p>
<p>
Secondly, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> saith, the case alters; for there the offender, <span class="mi">who seeks the life, doth implicitly at least act a divorce</span>.</p>
<p>
And I answer, that <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> nature, though no offender, doth the same.  But if an offender <span class="mi">by acting a divorce</span>, shall release the offended, this is an ample grant against himself.  <span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> saith, <span class="mi">nature teacheth to save life from one who seeks it</span>. And I say she teaches no less to save it from any other cause that endangers it, <span class="varspell" title="He">Hee</span> saith,<span class="mi"> that <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> they are both actors</span>.  Admit they were, it would not be uncharitable to part them; yet <span class="varspell" title="sometimes">somtimes</span> they are not both actors, but the one of them most lamentedly passive.  So <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> concludes, <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="We">Wee</span> must not take advantage of our own faults and corruptions to release us from our duties</span>.  But shall <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> take no advantage to save our <span class="varspell" title="selves">selvs</span> from the faults of another, who hath <span class="varspell" title="annulled">annull'd</span> his right to our duty?  No, saith <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span>, <span class="mi">Let them die of the sullens, and try who will <span class="varspell" title="pity">pitty</span> them</span>.  Barbarian, the shame of all honest <span class="varspell" title="Attornies">Atturneys</span>, why <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> they not <span class="varspell" title="hoist">hoise</span> him over the <span class="varspell" title="bar">barre</span>, and blanket him?</p><p>

Against the eighth Argument, that they who are destitute of all marriageable <span class="varspell" title="gifts">guifts</span>, except a body not plainly unfit, have not the calling to marry, and consequently married and so found, may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc'd</span>, this, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> saith, <span class="mi">is nothing to the purpose</span>, and not fit to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="answered">answer'd</span>.  I <span class="varspell" title="leave">leav</span> it <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to the judgment of his <span class="varspell" title="Masters">Maisters</span>.</p><p>

Against the ninth Argument, that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is a human society, and so <span class="varspell" title="chiefly">cheifly</span> seated in agreement and unity of <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>: If <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> the <span style="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> cannot have that due society by <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, that it may reasonably and humanly desire, it can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> no human society, and so not without reason divorcible: <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> he falsifies, and <span class="varspell" title="turns">turnes</span> what the position <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> of a reasonable agreement in the main matters of society, into <span class="mi">an agreement in all things</span>, which makes the opinion not mine, and so he <span class="varspell" title="leaves">leavs</span> it.</p><p>

At last, and in good <span class="varspell" title="hour">howr</span>, we are come to his farewell, which is to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a concluding taste of his jabberment in Law, the flashiest and the fustiest that ever corrupted in such an <span class="varspell" title="unswilled">unswill'd</span> hogshead.</p><p>

Against my tenth Argument, as he calls it, but as I intended it, my other position, that Divorce is not a thing determinable by a compulsive Law, for that all Law is for <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> good that may be frequently <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span> without the admixture of a <span class="varspell" title="worse">wors</span> inconvenience; but the Law forbidding divorce, never attains to any good end of such prohibition, but rather multiplies <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>; <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span>, the prohibition of divorce is no good Law.  Now for his <span class="varspell" title="Attorney's">Atturneys</span> <span class="varspell" title="prize">prise</span>: but first, like a right cunning and sturdy Logician, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> denies my Argument, not mattering whether in the <span class="mi">major</span> or <span class="mi">minor</span>: and saith, <span class="mi">there are many Laws made for good, and yet that good is not <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span>, through the defaults of the party, but a greater inconvenience follows</span>.</p><p>

But I reply, that this Answer builds upon a shallow foundation, and most unjustly supposes every one in default, who seeks divorce from the most injurious <span class="varspell" title="wedlock">wedloc</span>.  The default <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> will <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> found in the Law itself; which is neither able to punish the offender, but the innocent must <span class="varspell" title="withal">withall</span> suffer; nor can right the innocent in what is <span class="varspell" title="chiefly">cheifly</span> sought, the obtainment of love or quietness.  His instances out of the Common Law, are all so quite beside the matter which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> would prove, as may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> a warning to all clients how they venture <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="business">busines</span> with such a <span class="varspell" title="cock-brained">cock-braind</span> <span class="varspell" title="Solicitor">Sollicitor</span>.  For <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> Law of <span class="mi">England</span>, attaining to no good end, and yet through no default of the party, who is <span class="varspell" title="thereby">therby</span> <span class="varspell" title="debarred">debarr'd</span> all remedy, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> us only how <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> <span class="varspell" title="lose">loos</span> the benefit of good Laws through their own default.  His first example saith, <span class="mi">It is a just Law that every one shall peaceably enjoy his estate in Lands or otherwise</span>.  Does this Law attain to no good end?  the <span class="varspell" title="Bar">Barr</span> will blush at this most incogitant woodcock.  But see if a draft of <span class="mi">Littleton</span> will recover him to his senses.  <span class="mi">If this Man having Fee simple in his Lands, yet will take a <span class="varspell" title="Lease">Leas</span> of his own Lands from another, this shall be an Estoppel to him in an <span class="varspell" title="Assize">Assise</span> from the recovering of his own Land</span>. Mark now and register him.  How many are there of ten thousand who have such a Fee simple in their sconce, as to take a <span class="varspell" title="Lease">Leas</span> of their own Lands from another?  So that this inconvenience lights upon <span class="varspell" title="scarce">scars</span> one in an age, and by his own default; and the Law of enjoying each man his own, is good to all others.  But on the contrary, this prohibition of divorce is good to none, and brings inconvenience to numbers, who lie under intolerable <span class="varspell" title="grievances">greevances</span> without their own default, through the <span class="varspell" title="wickedness">wickednes</span> or folly of another; and all this iniquity the Law remedies not, but in a manner maintains?  His other cases are directly to the same <span class="varspell" title="purpose">purpos</span>, and might have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="spared">spar'd</span>, but that <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> is a <span class="varspell" title="tradesman">tradsman</span> of the Law, and must be born with at his first setting up, to lay forth his best ware, which is only <span class="varspell" title="gibberish">gibbrish</span>.</p><p>

I have now <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> that, which for many causes I might have thought, could not likely have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> my fortune, to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> put to this under-work of <span class="varspell" title="scouring">scowring</span> and unrubbishing the low and sordid ignorance of such a presumptuous <span class="varspell" title="losel">lozel</span>.  Yet <span class="mi">Hercules</span> had the <span class="varspell" title="labour">labour</span> once <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> upon him to carry dung out of the <span class="mi">Augean</span> stable.  At any hand I would <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="rid">ridd</span> of him: for I had rather, since the <a name="daily">life</a> of man is <span class="varspell" title="likened">likn'd</span> to a Scene, that all my entrances and <span class="mi">exits</span> might <span class="varspell" title="mix">mixe</span> with such persons only, whose worth erects them and their actions to a grave and <span class="mi">tragic</span> deportment, and not to have to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> with <span class="mi">Clowns and Vices</span>.  But if a man cannot peaceably walk into the world, but must <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> infested, <span class="varspell" title="sometimes">somtimes</span> at his face with <span class="varspell" title="dors">dorrs</span> and <span class="varspell" title="horseflies">horsflies</span>, <span class="varspell" title="sometimes">somtimes</span> beneath with <span class="varspell" title="bawling">bauling</span> whippets and shin-barkers, and these to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> set on by plot and consultation with a <span class="mi">Junto</span> of Clergy men and <span class="varspell" title="Licensers">Licencers</span>, commended also and <span class="varspell" title="rejoiced">rejoyc't</span> in by those whose partiality cannot yet <span class="varspell" title="forgo">forgoe</span> old <span class="varspell" title="papistical">papisticall</span> principles, have I not cause to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> in such a manner defensive, as may procure <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> freedom to pass more unmolested <span class="varspell" title="hereafter">heerafter</span> by those incumbrances, not so much regarded for <span class="varspell" title="themselves">themselvs</span>, as for those who incite them.  And what defence can properly <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> in such a despicable encounter as this, but either the flap or the spurn?  If they can afford <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> none but a ridiculous adversary, the blame belongs not to <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span>, though the whole Dispute <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="strewed">strew'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="scattered">scatter'd</span> with ridiculous.  And if <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> have such an ambition to know no better who are his mates, but among these needy thoughts, which though his two faculties of Serving-man and <span class="varspell" title="Solicitor">Sollicitor</span> should compound into one mongrel, would <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> but thin and meager, if in this penury of Soul <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> can <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> possible to have the lustiness to think of fame, let him but send <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> how <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> calls himself, and I may chance not fail to endorse him on the backside of posterity, not a <span class="mi">golden</span>, but a brazen <span class="varspell" title="Ass">Asse</span>.  <a name="sotadic">Since</a> my fate extorts from <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> a talent of sport, which I had thought to hide in a napkin, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> shall <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> my <span class="mi">Batrachomuomachia</span>, my <span class="mi">Bavius</span>, my <span class="mi">Calandrino</span>, the common <span class="varspell" title="adage">adagy</span> of ignorance and <span class="varspell" title="overweening">over-weening</span>. Nay, perhaps, as the provocation may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span>, I may <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="driven">driv'n</span> to <span class="varspell" title="curl">curle</span> up this gliding prose into a rough <span class="mi">Sotadic</span>, that shall <span class="varspell" title="rhyme">rime</span> him into such a condition, as instead of judging good Books to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="burned">burnt</span> by the executioner, <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> shall be readier to be his own hangman.  Thus much to this <span class="mi">Nuisance</span>.</p><p>

But as for the Subject it self which I have <span class="varspell" title="writ">writt</span> and now defend, according as the opposition <span class="varspell" title="bears">beares</span>; if any man equal to the matter, shall think it appertains him to take in hand this controversy, either excepting against <span class="varspell" title="aught">ought</span> <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span>, or <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> can <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> better how this question of such moment to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span> known, may <span class="varspell" title="receive">receav</span> a true determination, not leaning on the old and <span class="varspell" title="rotten">rott'n</span> suggestions <span class="varspell" title="whereon">wheron</span> it yet <span class="varspell" title="leans">leanes</span>; if his intents <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> sincere to the public, and shall carry him on without <span class="varspell" title="bitterness">bitternes</span> to the opinion, or to the person dissenting, let him not, I <span class="varspell" title="entreat">entreate</span> him, guess by the handling, which meritoriously hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="bestowed">bestowd</span> on this object of contempt and laughter, that I account it any displeasure <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> <span class="varspell" title="me">mee</span> to <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> contradicted in Print: but as it leads to the attainment of any thing more true, shall esteem it a benefit; and shall know how to return his civility and <span class="varspell" title="fair">faire</span> Argument in such a sort, as <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> shall confess that to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> so is my <span class="varspell" title="choice">choise</span>, and to have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> thus was my chance.</p>
