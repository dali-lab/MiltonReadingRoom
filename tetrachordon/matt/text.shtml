<i>It hath been said.</i> ]  What hitherto hath been spoke 
upon the Law of God touching Matrimony or Divorce, 
he who will deny to have been argu'd according to 
reason and all equity of Scripture, I cannot edify 
how, or by what rule of proportion that man's virtue 
calculate, what his elements are, nor what his 
analytics.  Confidently to those who have read good 
books, and to those whose reason is not an illiterate 
book to themselves, I appeal, whether they would not 
confess all this to be the commentary of truth and 
justice, were it not for these recited words of our 
Saviour.  And if they take not back that which they 
thus grant, nothing sooner might persuade them 
that Christ here teaches no new precept, and nothing 
sooner might direct them to find his meaning, than 
to compare and measure it by the rules of nature 
and eternal righteousness, which no written Law 
extinguishes, and the Gospel least of all.  For what 
can be more opposite and disparaging to the 
covenant of love, of freedom, and of our manhood in 
grace, than to be made the yoking pedagogue of new 
severities, the scribe of syllables and rigid letters, 
not only grievous to the best of men, but different 
and strange from the light of reason in them, save 
only as they are fain to stretch and distort their 
apprehensions for fear of displeasing the verbal 
straitness of a text, which our own servile fear gives 
us not the leisure to understand aright?  If the Law 
of Christ shall be written in our hearts, as was 
promis'd to the Gospel, <i>Jer.</i> 31. how can this in the 
vulgar and superficial sense be a Law of Christ, so far 
from being written in our hearts, that it injures and 
disallows not only the free dictates of Nature and 
moral Law, but of Charity also and Religion in our 
heart?  Our Saviour's doctrine is, that the end, and 
the fulfilling of every command is charity; no faith 
without it, no truth without it, no worship, no works 
pleasing to God but as they partake of charity.  He 
himself sets us an example, breaking the solemnest 
and strictest ordinance of religious rest, and justify'd 
the breaking, not to cure a dying man, but such 
whose cure might without danger have been 
deferr'd. And wherfore needs must the sick man's 
bed be carried home on that day by his 
appointment?  And why were the Disciples, who 
could not forbear on that day to pluck the corn, so 
industriously defended, but to shew us that if he 
preferr'd the slightest occasions of Man's good before 
the observing highest and severest ordinances, he 
gave us much more easy leave to break the 
intolerable yoke of a never well-join'd Wedloc for the 
removing of our heaviest afflictions?  Therfore it is 
that the most evangelic precepts are given us in 
proverbial forms, to drive us from the letter, tho' we 
love ever to be sticking there.  For no other cause did 
Christ assure us that <i>whatsoever things we bind, or 
slacken on earth, are so in heaven,</i> but to signify 
that the christian arbitrement of charity is supreme 
decider of all controversy, and supreme resolver of 
all Scripture; not as the Pope determines for his own 
tyranny, but as the Church ought to determine for 
its own true liberty.  Hence <i>Eusebius,</i> not far from 
the beginning of his History, compares the state of 
Christians to that of <i>Noah</i> and the Patriarchs before 
the Law.  And this indeed was the reason why 
Apostolic tradition in the ancient Church was 
counted nigh equal to the written word, tho' it 
carried them at length awry, for want of considering 
that tradition was not left to be impos'd as Law, but 
to be a pattern of that Christian prudence, and 
liberty which holy men by right assum'd of old; 
which truth was so evident, that it found entrance 
even into the Council of <i>Trent,</i> when the point of 
Tradition came to be discust.  And <i>Marinaro,</i> a 
learned <i>Carmelite,</i> for approaching too near the true 
cause that gave esteem to Tradition, that is to say, 
the difference between the Old and New Testament, 
the one punctually prescribing written Law, the 
other guiding by the inward Spirit, was reprehended 
by Cardinal <i>Pool</i> as one that had spoken more worthy 
a <i>German</i> Colloquy, than a General Council.  I omit 
many instances, many proofs and arguments of this 
kind, which alone would compile a just volume, and 
shall content me here to have shewn briefly that the 
great and almost only commandment of the Gospel, is 
to command nothing against the good of man, and 
much more no civil command against his civil good.  
If we understand not this, we are but crackt cimbals, 
we do but tinkle, we know nothing, we do nothing, all 
the sweat of our toilsomest obedience will but mock 
us.  And what we suffer superstitiously, returns us 
no thanks.  Thus med'cining our eyes, we need not 
doubt to see more into the meaning of these our 
Saviour's words, than many who have gone before 
us.<br><img

	<i>It hath been said, whosoever shall put away his 
wife.</i> ]  Our Saviour was by the Doctors of his time 
suspected of intending to dissolve the Law.  In this 
Chapter he wipes off this aspersion upon his 
Accusers, and shews, how they were the Law-
breakers.  In every Commonwealth, when it decays, 
corruption makes two main steps; first, when men 
cease to do according to the inward and uncompell'd 
actions of Virtue, caring only to live by the outward 
constraint of Law, and turn the simplicity of real 
good into the craft of seeming so by Law.  To this 
hypocritical honesty was <i>Rome</i>  declin'd in that Age 
wherin <i>Horace</i> liv'd, and discover'd it to <i>Quintius.</i>
<dfn>Whom do we count a good man, whom 
but he<br>
Who keeps the laws and statutes of the 
Senate?<br>
Who judges in great suits and 
controversies,<br>
Whose witness and opinion wins the 
cause?<br>
But his own house, and the whole 
neighbourhood<br>
Sees his foul inside through his whited 
skin.
</dfn><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	The next declining is, when Law becomes now too 
strait for the secular Manners, and those too loose 
for the cincture of Law.  This brings in false and 
crooked interpretations to eke out Law, and invents 
the suttle encroachment of obscure Traditions hard 
to be disprov'd.  To both these descents the <i>Pharisees</i> 
themselves were fallen.  Our Saviour therfore shews 
them both where they broke the Law, in not marking 
the divine Intent therof, but only the Letter; and 
where they depraved the Letter also with sophistical 
Expositions.  This Law of Divorce they had deprav'd 
both ways: first, by teaching that to give a Bill of 
Divorce was all the duty which that Law requir'd, 
whatever the cause were; next by running to Divorce 
for any trivial, accidental cause; whenas the Law 
evidently stays in the grave causes of natural and 
immutable dislike.  <i>It hath been said,</i> saith he.  Christ 
doth not put any contempt or disesteem upon the 
Law of <i>Moses,</i> by citing it so briefly; for in the same 
manner God himself cites a Law of greatest caution, 
<i>Jer.</i> 3.  <i>They say if a man put away his Wife, shall he 
return to her again? &c.</i>  Nor doth he more abolish it 
than the Law of swearing, cited next with the same 
brevity, and more appearance of contradicting: for 
Divorce hath an exception left it; but we are charg'd 
there, as absolutely as words can charge us, not to 
swear at all:yet who denies the awfulness of an Oath, 
tho' here it be in no case permitted?  And what shall 
become of his solemn Protestation not to abolish one 
Law, or one tittle of any Law, especially of those 
which he mentions in this Chapter?  And that he 
meant more particularly the not abolishing of Mosaic 
Divorce, is beyond all cavil manifest in <i>Luke</i> 16. 17, 
18. where this Clause against abrogating is inserted 
immediately before the sentence against Divorce, as 
if it were call'd thither on purpose to defend the 
equity of this particular Law against the foreseen 
rashness of common Textuaries, who abolish Laws, as 
the Rabble demolish Images, in the zeal of their 
hammers oft violating the Sepulchers of good men; 
like Pentheus in the Tragedies, they see that for 
Thebes which is not, and take that for Superstition, 
as these men in the heat of their annulling perceive 
not how they abolish Right, and Equal, and Justice, 
under the appearance of judicial.   And yet are 
confessing all the while, that these sayings of Christ 
stand not in contradiction to the Law of <i>Moses,</i> but to 
the false Doctrine of the <i>Pharisees</i> rais'd from 
thence; that the Law of God is perfect, not liable to 
additions or diminutions: and <i>Paraeus</i> accuses the 
Jesuit <i>Maldonatus</i> of greatest falsity for limiting the 
perfection of that Law only to the rudeness of the 
<i>Jews.</i>  He adds, <i>That the Law promiseth life to the 
performers therof, therfore needs not perfecter 
precepts than such as bring to life;</i> that if the 
corrections of Christ stand opposite, not to the 
corruptious of the <i>Pharisees,</i> but to the Law it self of 
God, the heresy of <i>Manes</i> would follow, one God of the 
Old Testament, and another of the New.  That Christ 
saith not here, <i>Except your righteousness exceed the 
righteousness of <i>Moses</i> Law,</i> but if the <i>Scribes</i> and 
<i>Pharisees.</i>  That all this may be true: whether is 
common sense flown asquint, if we can maintain that 
Christ forbid the Mosaic Divorce utterly, and yet 
abolish'd not the Law that permits it?  For if the 
Conscience only were checkt, and the Law not 
repeal'd, what means the Fanatic boldness of this 
Age, that dares tutor Christ to be more strict than 
he thought fit?  Ye shall have the evasion, <i>it was a 
judicial Law.</i>  What could infancy and slumber have 
invented more childish?  Judicial or not judicial, it 
was one of those Laws expresly which he forewarn'd 
us with protestation, that his mind was, not to 
abrogate: and if we mark the steerage of his words, 
what course they hold, we may perceive that what 
he protested not to dissolve (that he might faithfully 
and not deceitfully remove a suspicion from himself) 
was principally concerning the judicial Law; for of 
that sort are all these here which he vindicates, 
except the last.  Of the Ceremonial Law he told them 
true, <i>that nothing of it should pass until all were 
fulfill'd.</i>  Of the Moral Law he knew the <i>Pharisees</i> did 
not suspect he meant to nullify that : for so doing 
would soon have undone his authority, and advanced 
theirs.  Of the judicial Law therfore chiefly this 
Apology was meant: For how is that fulfill'd longer 
than the common equity therof remains in force?  
And how is this our Saviour's defence of himself not 
made fallacious, if the <i>Pharisee's</i> chief fear be lest he 
should abolish the judicial Law, and he to satisfy 
them, protests his good intention to the Moral Law?  
It is the general grant of Divines that what in the 
Judicial Law is not meerly judicial, but reaches to 
human equity in common, was never in the thought 
of being abrogated.  If our Saviour took away aught 
of the Law, it was the burthensome of it, not the ease 
of burden; it was the bondage, not the liberty of any 
divine Law, that he remov'd: this he often profest to 
be the end of his coming.  But what if the Law of 
Divorce be a Moral Law, as most certainly it is 
fundamentally, and hath been so prov'd in the 
reasons therof?  For tho' the giving of a Bill may be 
judicial, yet the act of Divorce is altogether 
conversant in good and evil, and so absolutely moral.  
So far as it is good, it never can be abolisht, being 
moral; and so far as it is simply evil, it never could 
be judicial, as hath been shewn at large in the 
Doctrine of Divorce, and will be reassum'd anon.  
Whence one of these two necessities follow, that 
either it was never establisht, or never abolisht.  
Thus much may be enough to have said on this place.  
The following Verse will be better unfolded in the 
19th Chapter, where it meets us again, after a large 
debatement on the Question between our Saviour 
and his Adversaries.<p>

<center>Mat. XIX. 3, 4, &c.</center><img

V. 3. <i> And the Pharisees came unto him, tempting 
him, and saying unto him.</i><p><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">

<i>Tempting him.</i> ]  The manner of these men coming to 
our Saviour, not to learn, but to tempt him, may give 
us to expect that their Answer will be such as is 
fittest for them; not so much a teaching, as an 
intangling.  No man, though never so willing or so 
well enabled to instruct, but if he discern his 
willingness and candor made use of to intrap him, 
will suddenly draw in himself, and laying aside the 
facil vein of perspicuity, will know his time to utter 
Clouds and Riddles; if he be not less wise than that 
noted Fish, whenas he should be not unwiser than 
the Serpent.  Our Saviour at no time exprest any 
great desire, to teach the obstinate and unteachable 
<i>Pharisees;</i> but when they came to tempt him, then 
least of all.  As now about the liberty of Divorce, so 
another time about the punishment of Adultery, 
they came to sound him; and what saisfaction got 
they from his answer, either to themselves or to us, 
that might direct a Law under the Gospel new from 
that of <i>Moses,</i> unless we draw his absolution of 
Adultery into an Edict?  So about the Tribute, who is 
there can pick out a full Solution, what and when we 
must give to <i>Caesar,</i> that which is CÊsar's, and all be 
<i>Caesar's</i> which hath his Image, we must either new 
stamp our Coin, or we may go new stamp our 
foreheads with the superscription of Slaves instead 
of Freemen.  Besides, it is a general Precept not only 
of Christ, but of all other Sages, not to instruct the 
unworthy and the conceited, who love Tradition 
more than Truth, but to perplex and stumble them 
purposely with contrived obscurities.  No wonder 
then if they who would determine of divorce by this 
place, have ever found it difficult, and unsatisfying 
through all the Ages of the Church, as <i>Austin</i> himself 
and other great Writers confess.  Lastly, it is 
manifest to be the principal scope of our Saviour, 
both here, and in the 5th of <i>Matthew,</i> to convince the 
<i>Pharisees</i> of what they being evil did licentiously, not 
to explain what others being good and blameless men 
might be permitted to do in case of extremity.  
Neither was it reasonable to talk of honest and 
conscientious liberty among them, who had abused 
legal and civil liberty to uncivil licence.  We do not 
say to a Servant what we say to a Son; nor was it 
expedient to preach Freedom to those who had 
transgressed in wantonness.  When we rebuke a 
Prodigal, we admonish him of Thrift, not of 
Magnificence, or Bounty.  And to school a proud man 
we labour to make him humble, not magnanimous.  
So Christ to retort these arrogant Inquisitors their 
own, took the course to lay their Haughtiness under 
a severity which they deserv'd; not to acquaint 
them, or to make them Judges either of the just 
man's Right and Privilege, or of the afflicted man's 
Necessity.  And if we may have leave to conjecture, 
there is a likelihood offer'd us by <i>Tertullian</i> in his 
4th against <i>Marcion,</i> wherby it may seem very 
probable that the <i>Pharisees</i> had a private drift of 
Malice against our Saviour's life in proposing this 
Question; and our Saviour had a peculiar aim in the 
rigor of his answer, both to let them know the 
freedom of his spirit, and the sharpness of his 
discerning. <i>This I must now shew,</i> saith <i>Tertullian,</i> 
<i>whence our Lord deduced this sentence, and which 
way he directed it,</i> wherby it will more fully appear 
that he intended not to dissolve  <i>Moses.</i>  And 
thereupon tells us, that the vehemence of this our 
Saviour's speech was chiefly darted against <i>Herod</i> 
and <i>Herodias.</i>  The Story is out of <i>Josephus;</i> <i>Herod</i> 
had been a long time married to the Daughter of 
<i>Aretas</i> King of <i>Petra,</i> till happening on his journey 
toward <i>Rome</i> to be entertain'd at his brother <i>Philip's </i>
house, he cast his eye unlawfully and unguestlike 
upon <i>Herodias</i> there, the wife of <i>Philip,</i> but Daughter 
of <i>Aristobulus</i> their common Brother, and durst 
make words of marrying her his Niece from his 
Brother's bed.  She assented, upon agreement he 
should expel his former Wife.  All was accomplish'd, 
and by the <i>Baptist</i> rebuk'd with the loss of his head.  
Though doubtless that stay'd not the various 
discourses of men upon the fact, which while the 
Herodian flatterers, and not a few perhaps among the 
<i>Pharisees,</i> endeavour'd to defend by wresting the 
Law, it might be a means to bring the Question of 
Divorce into a hot agitation among the People, how 
far <i>Moses</i> gave allowance.  The <i>Pharisees</i> therfore 
knowing our Saviour to be a friend of <i>John the 
Baptist,</i> and no doubt but having heard much of his 
Sermon in the mount, wherin he spake rigidly 
against the licence of Divorce, they put him this 
Question, both in hope to find him a contradicter of 
<i>Moses,</i> and a Condemner of <i>Herod;</i> so to insnare him 
within compass of the same accusation which had 
ended his friend; and our Saviour so orders his 
Answer, as that they might perceive Herod and his 
Adulteress, only not nam'd: so lively it concern'd 
them both what he spake.  No wonder then if the 
sentence of our Saviour sounded stricter than his 
custom was; which his conscious attempters 
doubtless apprehended sooner than his other 
Auditors.  Thus much we gain from hence to inform 
us, that what Christ intends to speak here of Divorce, 
will be rather the forbidding of what we may not do 
herein passionately and abusively, as Herod and 
Herodias did, than the discussing of what herein we 
may do reasonably and necessarily.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	<i>Is it lawful for a man to put away his Wife</i>? ]  It 
might be rendered more exactly from the <i>Greek,</i> to 
loosen or to set free; which tho' it seem to have  
milder signification than the two <i>Hebrew</i> words 
commonly us'd for divorce, yet interpreters hav 
enoted, that the <i>Greek</i> also is read in the <i>Septuagint,</i> 
for an act which is not without constraint.  As when 
<i>Achish</i> drove from the presence <i>David,</i> 
counterfeiting madness.  <i>Psal.</i> 34. the <i>Greek</i> word is 
the same with this here, <i>to put away.</i>  And <i>Erasmus</i> 
quotes <i>Hilary</i> rendering it by an expression not so 
soft.  Whence may be doubted, whether the <i>Pharisees</i> 
did not state this question in the strict right of the 
man, not tarrying for the wife's consent.  And if our 
Saviour answer directy according to what was askt in 
the term of putting away, it will be questionable, 
whether the rigor of his sentence did not forbid only 
such putting away as is without mutual consent, in a 
violent and harsh manner, or without any reason 
but will, as the Tetrarch did.  Which might be the 
cause that those christian Emperors fear'd not in 
their constitutions to dissolve Marriage by mutual 
consent; in that our Saviour seems here, as the case 
is most likely, not to condemn all divorce, but all 
injury and violence in divorce.  But no injury can be 
done to them, who seek it, as the <i>Ethics</i> of <i>Aristotle</i> 
sufficiently prove.  True it is, that an unjust thing 
may be done to one tho' willing, and so may justly be 
forbidden: But divorce being in itself no unjust or 
evil thing, but only as it is join'd with injury, or lust; 
injury it cannot be at law, if consent be, and 
Aristotle err not.  And lust it may as frequently not 
be, while charity hath the judging of so many private 
grievances in a misfortun'd Wedloc, which may 
pardonably seek a redemption.  But whether it be or 
not, the Law cannot discern, nor examine lust, so 
long as it walks from one lawful term to another, 
from Divorce to Marriage, both in themselves 
indifferent.  For if the Law cannot take hold to punish 
many actions apparently covetous, ambitious, 
ingrateful, proud, how can it forbid and punish that 
for lust, which is but only surmis'd so, and can no 
more be certainly prov'd in the divorcing now, than 
before in the marrying?  Whence if Divorce be no 
unjust thing, but through lust, a cause not 
discernable by Law, as Law is wont to discern in 
other cases, and can be no injury, where consent is; 
there can be nothing in the equity of Law, why 
Divorce by consent may not be lawful: leaving 
secrecies to conscience, the thing which our Saviour 
here aims to rectify, not to revoke the statutes of 
<i>Moses.</i>  In the mean while the word to put away, 
being in the <i>Greek</i> to loosen or dissolve, utterly takes 
away that vain papistical distinction of divorce from 
bed, and divorce from bond, evincing plainly, that 
Christ and the <i>Pharisees</i> mean here that divorce 
which finally dissolves the bond, and frees both 
parties to a second Marriage.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	<i>For every cause.</i> ]  This the <i>Pharisees</i> held, that 
for every cause they might divorce, for every 
accidental cause, and quarrel of difference that might 
happen.  So both <i>Josephus</i> and <i>Philo,</i> men who liv'd 
in the same age, explain; and the <i>Syriac</i> translator, 
whose antiquity is thought parallel to the Evangelists 
themselves, reads it conformably upon any occasion 
or pretence.  Divines also generally agree that thus 
the Pharisees meant.  Cameron a late Writer, much 
applauded commenting this place not undiligently, 
affirms that the <i>Greek</i> preposition kaòa translated 
unusually (<i>for</i>) hath a force in it implying the 
suddenness of those Pharisaic divorces; and that 
their queston was to this effect, whether for any 
cause whatever it chanced to be, straight as it rose, 
the divorce might be lawful.  This he freely gives, 
whatever mov'd him, and I as freely take, nor can 
deny his observation to be acute and learn'd.  If 
therfore we insist upon the word of putting away, 
that it imports a constraint without consent, as 
might be insisted, and may enjoy what <i>Cameron</i> 
bestows on us, that for every cause is to be 
understood, according as any cause may happen, 
with a relation to the speediness of those divorces, 
and that Herodian act especially, as is already 
brought us, the sentence of our Saviour will appear 
nothing so strict a prohibition as hath been long 
conceiv'd, forbidding only to divorce for casual and 
temporary causes, that may be soon ended, or soon 
remedied; and likewise forbidding to divorce rashly, 
and on the sudden heat, except it be for adultery.  If 
these qualifications may be admitted, as partly we 
offer them, partly are offered them by some of their 
own opinion, and that where nothing is repugnant, 
why they should not be admitted, nothing can wrest 
them from us, the severe sentence of our Saviour 
will straight unbend the seeming frown into that 
gentleness and compassion which was so abundant in 
all his actions, his office and his doctrine, from all 
which otherwise it stands off at no mean distance.<p><img

	4, and 5.  <i>Made them male and female; And said, 
for this cause, &c.</i> ]  We see it here undeniably, that 
the Law which our Saviour cites to prove that 
divorce was forbidden, is not an absolute and 
tyrannical command without reason, as now-a-days 
we make it little better, but is grounded upon some 
rational cause not difficult to be apprehended, being 
in a matter which equally concerns the meanest and 
the plainest sort of persons in a houshold life.  Our 
next way then will be to enquire if there be not more 
reasons than one; and if there be, whether this be 
the best and chiefest.  That we shall find by turning 
to the first institution, to which Christ refers our 
own reading: He himself having to deal with 
treacherous assailants, useth brevity, and lighting 
on the first place in Genesis that mentions any thing 
tending to Marriage in the first chapter, joins it 
immediately to the 24th verse of the 2d chapter, 
omitting all the prime words between, which create 
the institution, and contain the noblest and purest 
ends of Matrimony; without which attain'd, that 
conjunction hath nothing in it above what is common 
to us with beasts.  So likewise beneath in this very 
chapter, to the young man who came not tempting 
him, but to learn of him, asking him which 
commandments he should keep; he neither repeats 
the first Table, nor all the second, nor that in order 
which he repeats.  If here then being tempted, he 
desire to be the sorter, and the darker in his 
Conference, and omit to cite that from the second of 
Genesis, which all Divines confess is a Commentary to 
what he cites out of the first, the making them Male 
and Female: what are we to do, but to search the 
institution our selves?  And we shall find there his 
own authority, giving other manner of reasons why 
such firm union is to be in Matrimony; without which 
reasons, their being male and female can be no cause 
of joining them unseparably: for if it be, then no 
Adultery can sever.  Therfore the prohibition of 
Divorce depends not upon this reason here exprest 
to the <i>Pharisees,</i> but upon the plainer and more 
eminent causes omitted here, and referr'd to the 
institution; which causes not being found in a 
particular and casual Matrimony, this sensitive and 
materious cause alone can no more hinder a divorce 
against those higher and more human reasons 
urging it, than it can alone without them to warrant 
a copulation, but leaves arbitrary to those who in 
their chance of Marriage find not why Divorce is 
forbid them, but why it is permitted them; and find 
both here and in <i>Genesis,</i> that the forbidding is not 
absolute, but according to the reasons there taught 
us, not here.  And that our Saviour taught them no 
better, but uses the most vulgar, most animal and 
corporal argument to convince them, is first to shew 
us, that as thro' their licentious Divorces they made 
no more of Marriage than, as if to marry were no 
more than to be male and female, so he goes no 
higher in his confutation, deeming them unworthy to 
be talk'd with in a higher strain, but to be ty'd in 
Marriage by the meer material cause therof, since 
their own licence testify'd that nothing matrimonial 
was in their thought, but to be male and female.  
Next, it might be done to discover the brute 
ignorance of these carnal doctors, who taking on 
them to dispute of Marriage and Divorce, were put to 
silence with such a slender opposition as this, and 
outed from their hold with scarce one quarter of an 
argument.  That we may believe this, his 
entertainment of the young man soon after may 
persuade us.  Whom, tho' he came to preach eternal 
life by faith only, he dismisses with a salvation 
taught him by his words only.  On which place 
ParÊus notes, That this man was to be convinc'd by a 
false persuasion; and that Christ is wont otherwise to 
answer hypocrites, otherwise those that are docible.  
Much rather then may we think that in handling 
these tempters he forgot not so to frame his prudent 
ambiguities and concealments, as was to the 
troubling of those peremptory disputants most 
wholesome.  When therfore we would know what 
right there may be, in ill accidents, to divorce, we 
must repair thither where God professes to teach his 
Servants by the prime institution, and not where we 
see him intending to dazzle Sophisters: we must not 
read, <i>he made them Male and Female,</i> and not 
understand he made them more intendedly a meet 
help to remove the evil of being alone.  We must take 
both these together, and then we may infer 
compleatly, as from the whole cause, why a man shall 
cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh: 
but if the full and chief cause why we may not 
divorce be wanting here, this place may skirmish 
with the <i>Rabbies</i> while it will, but to the true 
Christian it prohibits nothing beyond the full reason 
of its own prohibiting, which is best known by the 
institution.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Ver. 6.  <i>Wherfore they are no more twain, but 
one flesh.</i> ]  This is true in the general right of 
Marriage, but not in the chance-medley of every 
particular match.  For if they who were once 
undoubtedly one flesh, yet become twain by 
adultery, then sure they who were never one flesh 
rightly, never helps meet for each other according to 
the plain prescript of God, may with less ado than a 
volume be concluded still twain.  And so long as we 
account a Magistrate no Magistrate, if there be but a 
flaw in his election, why should we not much rather 
count a Matrimony no Matrimony, if it cannot be in 
any reasonable manner according to the words of 
God's institution?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	<i>What therfore God hath joined, let no man put 
asunder.</i> ]  but here the Christian prudence lies to 
consider what God hath join'd; shall we say that God 
hath join'd error, fraud, unfitness, wrath, 
contention, perpetual loneliness, perpetual discord; 
whatever lust, or wine, or witchery, threat, or 
inticement, avarice, or ambition hath joined 
together, faithful with unfaithful, Christian with 
Antichristian, hate with hate, or hate with love, shall 
we say this is God's joining?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	<i>Let no man put asunder.</i> ]  That is to say, <i>what 
God hath join'd;</i> for if it be, as how oft we see it may 
be, not of God's joining, and his Law tells us he joins 
not unmatchable things, but hates to join them, as an 
abominable confusion, then the divine law of <i>Moses</i> 
puts them asunder, his own divine will in the 
institution puts them asunder, as oft as the reasons 
be not extant, for which God ordain'd their joining.  
Man only puts asunder when his inordinate desires, 
his passion, his violence, his injury makes the 
breach: not when the utter want of that which 
lawfully was the end of his joining, when wrongs and 
extremities and unsupportable grievances compel 
him to disjoin: when such as <i>Herod</i> and the <i>Pharisees</i> 
divorce beside law, or against law, then only man 
separates, and to such only this prohibition belongs.  
In a word, if it be unlawful for man to put asunder 
that which God hath join'd, let man take heed it be 
not detestable to join that by compulsion which God 
hath put asunder.<p><img

Ver. 7.  <i>They say unto him, Why did <i>Moses</i> 
command to give a writing of divorcement, and to 
put her away</i>?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
Ver. 8.  <i>He saith unto them, <i>Moses</i> because of the 
hardness of your hearts suffer'd you to put away 
your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.</i><p><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">

	<i><i>Moses</i> because of the hardness of your hearts 
suffer'd you.</i>  Hence the Divinity now current argues 
that this judicial <i>Moses</i> is abolish'd.  But suppose it 
were so, tho' it hath been prov'd otherwise, the 
firmness of such right to divorce as here pleads is 
fetch'd from the prime institution, does not stand or 
fall with the judicial <i>Jew,</i> but is as moral as what is 
moralest.  Yet as I have shewn positively that this 
law cannot be abrogated, both by the words of our 
Saviour pronouncing the contrary, and by that 
unabolishable equity which it conveys to us; so I 
shall now bring to view those appearances of 
strength which are levied from this text to maintain 
the most gross and massy paradox that ever did 
violence to reason and religion, bred only under the 
shadow of these words, to all other Piety or 
Philosophy strange and insolent, that God by act of 
law drew out a line of Adultery almost two thousand 
years long: altho' to detect the prodigy of this 
surmise, the former book set forth on this argument 
hath already been copious.  I shall not repeat much, 
tho' I might borrow of mine own; but shall 
endeavour to add something either yet untouch'd, or 
not largely enough explain'd.  First, it shall be 
manifest that the common exposition cannot possibly 
consist with christian doctrine: next, a truer 
meaning of this our Saviour's reply shall be left in 
the room.  The receiv'd exposition is, that God, tho' 
not approving, did enact a law to permit adultery by 
divorcement simply unlawful.  And this conceit they 
feed with fond supposals that have not the least 
footing in Scripture: As that the <i>Jews</i> learnt this 
custom of divorce in <i>Egypt,</i> and therfore God would 
not unteach it them till Christ came, but let it stick as 
a notorious botch of deformity in the midst of his 
most perfect and severe law.  And yet he saith, <i>Levit.</i> 
the 18th, <i>After the doings of Egypt ye shall not do.</i>  
Another while they invent a slander (as what thing 
more bold than teaching Ignorance when he shifts to 
hide his nakedness?) that the <i>Jews</i> were naturally to 
their wives the cruellest men in the world; would 
poison, brain, and do I know not what if they might 
not divorce.  Certain, if it were a fault heavily 
punish'd, to bring an evil report upon the land which 
God gave, what is it to raise a groundless calumny 
against the people which God made choice of?  But 
that this bold interpretament, how commonly soever 
sided with, cannot stand a minute with any 
competent reverence to God or his Law, or his 
People, nor with any other maxim of religion, or good 
manners, might be prov'd thro' all the heads and the 
Topics of argumentation; but I shall willingly be as 
concise as possible.  First the Law, not only the moral, 
but the judicial, given by <i>Moses,</i> is just and pure; for 
such is God who gave it.  <i>Hearken O Israel,</i> saith 
<i>Moses,</i> <i>Deut.</i> 4. <i>unto the statutes and the judgments 
which I teach you, to do them, that ye may live, &c.</i>  
<i>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command 
you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye 
may keep the commandments of the Lord your God 
which I command you.</i>  And onward in this chapter, 
<i>Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, 
even as the Lord my God commanded me.  Keep 
therfore and do them, for this is your wisdom and 
your understanding.  For what nation hath God so 
nigh unto them, and what nation hath statutes and 
judgments so righteous as all this law which I set 
before ye this day</i>?  Is it imaginable there should be 
among these a law which God allow'd not, a law giving 
permissions laxative to unmarry a wife and marry a 
lust, a law to suffer a kind of tribunal adultery?  
Many other Scriptures might be brought to assert 
the purity of this judicial Law, and many I have 
alledg'd before; this law therfore is pure and just.  
But if it permit, if it teach, if it defend that which is 
both unjust and impure, as by the common doctrine 
it doth, what think we?  The three general doctrines 
of <i>Justinian's</i> Law, are <i>To live in honesty, To hurt no 
man, to Give every one his due.</i>  Shall the <i>Roman</i> 
Civil law observe these three things, as the only end 
of law, and shall a statute be found in the civil law of 
God, enacted simply and totally against all these 
three precepts of nature and morality?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Secondly, the gifts of God are all perfect, and 
certainly the Law is of all his other gifts one of the 
perfectest.  But if it give that outwardly which it 
takes away really, and give that seemingly, which, if 
a man take it, wraps him into sin and damns him; 
what gift of an enemy can be more dangerous and 
destroying than this?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Thirdly, <i>Moses</i> every-where commends his Laws, 
prefers them before all of other Nations, and 
warrants them to be <i>the way of Life and Safety to all 
that walk therin,</i> <i>Levit.</i> 18.  But if they contain 
Statutes which God approves not, and train men 
unweeting to commit injustice and adultery under 
the shelter of Law; if those things be sin, and death 
sin's wages, what is this Law but the snare of death?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Fourthly, The Statutes and Judgments of the Lord, 
which, without exception, are often told us to be 
such, as doing we may live by them, are doubtless to 
be counted the rule of knowledge and of conscience.  
<i>For I had not known lust,</i> saith the Apostle, <i>but by 
the law.</i>  But if the Law come down from the state of 
her incorruptible Majesty to grant lust his boon, 
palpably it darkens and confounds both knowledge 
and conscience; it goes against the common office of 
all goodness and friendliness, which is at least to 
counsel and admonish; it subverts the rules of all 
sober education, and is itself a most negligent and 
debauching Tutor.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Fifthly, If the Law permits a thing unlawful, it 
permits that which else-where it hath forbid; so that 
hereby it contradicts it self, and transgresses it self.  
But if the Law become a transgressor, it stands guilty 
to itself, and how then shall it save another?  It 
makes a confederacy with sin, how then can it justly 
condemn a sinner?  And thus reducing it self to the 
state of neither saving nor condemning, it wil not fail 
to expire solemnly ridiculous.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Sixthly, The Prophets in Scripture declare 
severely against the decreeing of that which is 
unjust, <i>Psal.</i> 94. 20.  <i>Isaiah</i> the 10th.  <i>But it was 
done,</i> they say, <i>for hardness of heart:</i> To which 
objection the Apostle's rule, not to do evil that good 
may come therby, gives an invincible repulse: and 
here especially, where it cannot be shewn how any 
good came by doing this evil, how rather more evil 
did not hereon abound; for the giving way to 
hardness of heart hardens the more, and adds more 
to the number.  God to an evil and adulterous 
generation would not grant a sign; much less would 
he for their hardness of heart pollute his Law with 
adulterous permission.  <i>Yea, but to permit evil, is not 
to do evil.</i>  Yes, it is in a most eminent manner to do 
evil: where else are all our grave and faithful 
sayings, that he whose office is to forbid and forbids 
not, bids, exhorts, encourages?  Why hath God 
denounc'd his anger against Parents, Masters, 
Friends, Magistrates neglectful of forbidding what 
they ought, if Law, the common Father, Master, 
Friend, and perpetual Magistrate shall not only 
forbid, but enact, exhibit, and uphold with 
countenance and protection, a deed every way 
dishonest, whatever the pretence be.  If it were of 
those inward vices, which the Law cannot by 
outward constraint remedy, but leaves to conscience 
and persuasion, it had been guiltless in being silent: 
but to write a Decree of that which can be no way 
lawful, and might with ease be hinder'd, makes Law 
by the doom of Law it self accessory in the highest 
degree.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Seventhly, It makes God the direct Author of Sin: 
For altho' he be not made the Author of what he 
silently permits in his Providence, yet in his Law, the 
image of his Will, when in plain expression he 
constitutes and ordains a fact utterly unlawful; what 
wants he to authorize it, and what wants that to be 
the author?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Eighthly, To establish by Law a thing wholly 
unlawful and dishonest, is an affirmation was never 
heard of before in any Law, Reason, Philosophy, or 
Religion, till it was rais'd by inconsiderate Glossists 
from the mistake of this Text.  And tho' the Civilians 
have been contented to chew this opinion, after the 
Canon had subdu'd them, yet they never could bring 
example or authority either from divine Writ, or 
human Learning, or human Practice in any Nation, or 
well-form'd Republic, but only from the customary 
abuse of this text.  Usually they allege the Epistle of 
<i>Cicero</i> to <i>Atticus;</i> wherin <i>Cato</i> is blam'd for giving 
sentence to the scum of <i>Romulus,</i> as if he were in 
<i>Plato's</i> Commonwealth.  <i>Cato</i> could have call'd some 
great one into judgment for Bribery; <i>Cicero,</i> as the 
time stood, advis'd against it.  <i>Cato,</i> not to endamage 
the public Treasury, would not grant to the <i>Roman</i> 
Knights, that the <i>Asian</i> Taxes might be farm'd them 
at a less rate.  <i>Cicero</i> wish'd it granted.  Nothing in all 
this will be like the establishing of a Law to sin: Here 
are no Laws made, here only the execution of Law is 
crav'd might be suspended: between which and our 
question is a broad difference.  And what if human 
Lawgivers have confest they could not frame their 
Laws to that Perfection which they desir'd?  We hear 
of no such confession from <i>Moses</i> concerning the 
Laws of God, but rather all praise and high testimony 
of perfection given them.  And altho' man's nature 
cannot bear exactest Laws, yet still within the 
confines of good it may and must, so long as less good 
is far enough from altogether evil.  As for what they 
instance of Usury, let them first prove Usury to be 
wholly unlawful, as the Law allows it; which learned 
Men as numerous on the other side will deny them.  
Or if it be altogether unlawful, why is it tolerated 
more than Divorce?  He who said, <i>Divorce not,</i> said 
also, <i>Lend, hoping for nothing again,</i> <i>Luk.</i> 6. 35.  But 
then they put it, that Trade could not stand, and so 
to serve the commodity of insatiable trading, Usury 
shall be permitted; but Divorce, the only means 
oftimes to right the innocent and outragiously 
wrong'd, shall be utterly forbid.  This is egregious 
doctrine, and for which one day Charity will much 
thank them.  <i>Beza</i> not finding how to salve this 
perplexity, and <i>Cameron</i> since him, would secure us; 
although the latter confesses, that to permit a wicked 
thing by law, is a wickedness which God abhors; yet 
to limit sin, and prescribe it a certain measure, is 
good.  First, this evasion will not help here; for this 
Law bounded no man; he might put away whatever 
found not favour in his eyes.  And how could it forbid 
to divorce, whom it could not forbid to dislike, or 
command to love?  If these be the limits of Law to 
restrain sin, who so lame a sinner but may hop over 
them more easily than over those <i>Romulean</i> 
circumscriptions, not as <i>Remus</i> did with hard 
success, but with all indemnity?  Such a limiting as 
this were not worth the mischief that accompanies it.  
This Law therfore not bounding the supposed sin, by 
permitting enlarges it, gives it enfranchisement.  
And never greater confusion, than when Law and Sin 
more their Landmarks, mix their Territories, and 
correspond, have intercourse and traffic together.  
When Law contracts a kindred and hospitality with 
Transgression, becomes the godfather of Sin, and 
names it lawful; when sin revels, and gossips within 
the Arsenal of Law, plays and dandles the Artillery 
of Justice that should be bent against her, this is a 
fair limitation indeed.  Besides, it is an absurdity to 
say that Law can measure sin, or moderate sin; sin is 
not in a predicament, to be measur'd and modify'd, 
but is always an excess.  The least sin that is, exceeds 
the measure of the largest Law that can be good; and 
is as boundless as that vacuity beyond the world.  If 
once it square to the measure of Law, it ceases to be 
an excess, and consequently ceases to be a sin; or 
else Law conforming itself to the obliquity of sin, 
betrays itself to be not streight, but crooked, and so 
immediately no Law.  And the improper conceit of 
moderating sin by Law, will appear, if we can imagine 
any Law-giver so sensless as to decree that so far a 
man may steal, and thus far be drunk, that 
moderately he may couzen, and moderately  commit 
adultery.  To the same extent it would be as pithily 
absurd to publish that a man may moderately 
divorce, if to do that be intirely naught.  But to end 
this moot, the Law of <i>Moses</i> is manifest to fix no limit 
therin at all, or such at least as impeaches the 
fraudulent abuser no more than if it were not set; 
only requires the dismissive writing without other 
caution, leaves that to the inner man, and the bar of 
Conscience.  But it stopt other sins.  This is as vain as 
the rest, and dangerously uncertain: the contrary to 
be fear'd rather, that one sin admitted courteously 
by Law, open't the gate to another.  However, evil 
must not be done for good.  And it were a fall to be 
lamented, and indignity unspeakable, if Law should 
become tributary to sin her slave, and forc'd to yield 
up into his hands her awful Minister, Punishment, 
should but out her peace with sin for sin, paying as it 
were her so many <i>Philistian</i> foreskins to the proud 
demand of Transgression.  But suppose it any way 
possible to limit Sin, to put a girdle about that Chaos, 
suppose it also good; yet if to permit sin by Law be an 
abomination in the eyes of God, as <i>Cameron</i> 
acknowledges, the evil of permitting will eat out the 
good of limiting.  For though sin be not limited, there 
can but evil come out of evil; but if it be pemitted and 
decreed lawfully by divine Law, of force then sin 
must proceed from the infinite good, which is a 
dreadul thought.  But if the restraining of sin by this 
permission being good, as this author testifies, be 
more good than the permission of more sin by the 
restraint of Divorce, and that God weighing both 
these like two ingots, in the perfect scales of his 
Justice and Providence, found them so, and others 
coming without authority from God, shall change this 
counterpoise, andjudge it better to let sin multiply 
by setting a judicial restraint upon divorce, which 
Christ never set; then to limit sin by this permission, 
as God himself thought best to permit it, it will 
behove them to consult betimes whether these their 
ballances be not false and abominable; and this their 
limiting that which God loosen'd, and their loosening 
the sins that he limited, which they confess was good 
to do: and were it possible to do by Law, doubtless it 
would be most morally good; and they so believing, 
as we hear they do, and yet abolishing a Law so good 
and moral, the limiter of sin, what are they else but 
contrary to themselves?  For they can never bring 
us to that time wherin it will not be good to limit sin, 
and they can never limit it better than so as God 
prescribed in his Law.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	Others conceive it a more defencible retirement 
to say this permission to divorce sinfully for 
hardness of heart was a dispensation.  But surely 
they either know not or attend not to what a 
dispensation means.  A dispensation is for no long 
time, is particular to some persons, rather than 
general to whole people; always hath Charity the 
end, is granted to necessities and infirmities, not to 
obstinate lust.  This permission is another creature, 
hath all those evils and absurdities following the 
name of a dispensation, as when it was nam'd a Law; 
and is the very antarctic pole against Charity, 
nothing more adverse, ensnaring and ruining those 
that trust in it, or use it; so leud and criminous as 
never durst enter into the head of any Politician, 
<i>Jew,</i> or Proselyte, till they became the apt Scholars of 
this Canonistic Exposition.  Aught in it, that can 
allude in the least manner to Charity, or Goodness, 
belongs with more full right to the Christian under 
Grace and Liberty, than to the <i>Jew</i> under Law and 
Bondage.  To Jewish ignorance it could not be 
dispensed, without a horrid imputation laid upon the 
Law, to dispense foully, instead of teaching fairly; like 
that dispensation that first polluted Christendom 
with Idolatry, permitting to laymen Images instead 
of Books and Preaching.  Sloth or malice in the Law 
would they have this call'd?  But what ignorance can 
be pretended of the <i>Jews,</i> who had all the same 
Precepts about Marriage, that we now? for Christ 
refers all to the institution.  It was as reasonable for 
them to know then as for us now, and concern'd 
them alike: for wherin hath the Gospel alter'd the 
nature of Matrimony?  All these considerations, or 
many of them, have been further amplify'd in the 
<i>Doctrine of Divorce.</i>  And what <i>Rivetus</i> and <i>Paraeus</i> 
have objected, or given over as past cure, hath been 
there discuss'd.  Wherby it may be plain enough to 
men of eyes, that the vulgar exposition of a 
permittance by Law to an entire sin, whatever the 
colour may be, is an opinion both ungodly, unpolitic, 
unvirtuous, and void of all honesty and civil sense.  
It appertains therfore to every zealous Christian 
both for the honour of God's Laws, and the 
vindication of our Saviour's Words, that such an 
irreligious depravement no longer may be sooth'd 
and flatter'd through custom, but with all diligence 
and speed solidly refuted, and in the room a better 
explanation given; which is now our next endeavour.<br><img

	<i><i>Moses</i> suffered you to put away, &c.</i> ]  <i>Not 
commanded you,</i> says the common observer, <i>and

you this Command.</i>  And the <i>Pharisees</i> who here say, 
<i>Moses</i> commanded, and would mainly have it a 
command, in that place of <i>Mark</i> say <i>Moses</i> <i>suffer'd,</i> 
which had made against them in their own mouths, if 
the word of suffering had weaken'd the command.  So 
that <i>suffer'd</i> and <i>commanded</i> is here taken for the 
same thing on both sides of the controversy: as 
<i>Cameron</i> also and others on this place acknowledge.  
And Lawyers know that all the precepts of Law are 
divided into obligatory and permissive, containing 
either what we must do, or what we may do; and of 
this latter sort are as many precepts as of the 
former, and all as lawful.  Tutelage, an ordainment 
than which nothing more just, being for the defence 
of Orphans, the Institutes of Justinian say is given 
and permitted by the Civil Law: and to Parents it is 
permitted to choose and appoint by will the 
Guardians of their Children.  What more equal, and 
yet the Civil Law calls this permission.  So likewise to 
manumise, to adopt, to make a Will, and to be made 
an Heir, is called permission by the Law.  Marriage 
itself, and this which is already granted, to divorce 
for Adultery, obliges no man, is but a permission by 
Law, is but suffer'd.  By this we may see how weakly 
it hath been thought that all Divorce is utterly 
unlawful because the Law is said to suffer it: whenas 
to suffer is but the legal phrase denoting what by 
Law a Man may do or not do.<br><img

	<i>Because of the hardness of your hearts.</i> ]  Hence 
they argue that therfore he allow'd it not; and 
therfore it must be abolisht.  But the contrary to this 
will sooner follow, that because he suffer'd it for a 
cause, therfore in relation to that cause he allow'd it.  
Next, if he in his wisdom, and in the midst of his 
severity allow'd it for hardness of neart, it can be 
nothing better thn arrogance and presumption to 
take stricter courses against hardness of heart, than 
God ever set an example; and that under the Gospel, 
which warrants them to no judicial act of compulsion 
in this matter, much less to be more severe against 
hardness of extremity, than God thought good to be 
against hardness of heart.  He suffer'd it, rather than 
worse inconveniences; these men wiser, as they 
make themselves, will suffer the worst and 
heinousest inconveniences to follow, rather than 
they will suffer what God suffer'd.  Altho' they can 
know when they please, that Christ spake only to the 
Conscience, did not judge on the civil bench, but 
always disavow'd it.  What can be more contrary to 
the ways of God than these their doings?  If they be 
such enemies to hardness of heart, altho' this 
groundless rigor proclaims it to be in themselves, 
they may yet learn, or consider that hardness of 
heart hath a twofold acceptation in the Gospel.  One, 
when it is in a good man taken for infirmity, and 
imperfection, which was in all the Apostles, whose 
weakenss only, not utter want of belief, is call'd 
hardness of heart, <i>Mark</i> 16.  Partly for this hardness 
of heart, the imperfection and decay of man from 
original righteousness, it was that God suffer'd not 
Divorce only, but all that which by Civilians is term'd 
the secondary Law of Nature and of Nations.  He 
suffer'd his own People to waste and spoil and slay by 
War, to lead captives, to be some masters, some 
servants, some to be Princes, others to be Subjects; 
he suffered propriety to divide all things by several 
possession, trade and commerce, not without usury; 
in his commonwealth some to be undeservedly rich, 
others to be undeservedly poor.  All which till 
hardness of heart came in, was most unjust; whenas 
prime Nature made us all equal, made us equal 
coheirs by common right and dominion over all 
creatures.  In the same manner, and for the same 
cause he suffer'd Divorce as well as Marriage, our 
imperfect and degenerate condition of necessity 
requiring this Law among the rest, as a remedy 
against intolerable wrong and servitude above the 
patience of man to bear.  Nor was it given only 
because our infirmity, or if it must be so call'd, 
hardness of heart could not endure all things; but 
because the hardness of another's heart might not 
inflict all things upon an innocent person, whom far 
other ends brought into a league of love, and not of 
bondage and indignity.  If therfore we abolish 
Divorce as only suffer'd for hardness of heart, we 
may as well abolish the whole Law of Nations, as only 
suffer'd for the same cause, it being shewn us by S. 
<i>Paul,</i> 1 <i>Cor.</i> 6. that the very seeking of a man's right 
by Law, and at the hands of a worldly Magistrate, is 
not without the hardness of our hearts.  For why do 
ye not rather take wrong, saith he, why suffer ye 
not rather your selves to be defrauded?  If nothing 
now must be suffer'd for hardness of heart, I say the 
very prosecution of our right by way of civil Justice 
can no more be suffer'd among Christians, for the 
hardness of heart wherwith most men pursue it.  
And that would next remove all our judicial Laws, 
and this restraint of Divorce also in the number; 
which would more than half end the controversy.  
But if it be plain that the whole juridical Law and 
Civil Power is only suffer'd under the Gospel, for the 
hardness of our hearts, then wherfore should not 
that which <i>Moses</i> suffer'd, be suffer'd still by the 
same reason?<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	In a second signification hardness of heart is 
taken for a stubborn resolution to do evil.  And that 
God ever makes any Law purposely to such, I deny; 
for he vouchsafes not to enter Covenant with them, 
but as they fortune to be mixt with good men, and 
pass undiscover'd; much less that he should decree 
an unlawful thing only to serve their licentiousness.  
But that God suffers this reprobate hardness of 
heart I affirm, not only in this law of Divorce, but 
throughout all his best and purest Commandments.  
He commands all to worship in singleness of heart 
according to all his Ordinances; and yet suffers the 
wicked man to perform all the rites of Religion 
hypocritically, and in the hardness of his heart.  He 
gives us general statutes and privileges in all civil 
matters, just and good of themselves, yet suffers 
unworthiest men to use them, and by them to 
prosecute their own right, or any colour of right, 
tho' for the most part maliciously, covetously, 
rigorously, revengefully.  He allow'd by law the 
discreet Father and Husband to forbid, if he thought 
fit, the religious vows of his wife or daughter, <i>Numb.</i> 
30. and in the same law suffer'd the hard-
heartedness of impious and covetous fathers or 
husbands abusing this law to forbid their wives or 
daughters in their offerings and devotions of 
greatest zeal.  If then God suffer hardness of heart 
equally in the best Laws, as in this of Divorce, there 
can be no reason that for this cause this Law should 
be abolish'd.  But other Laws, they object, may be 
well us'd, this never.  How often shall I answer both 
from the institution of Marriage, and from other 
general rules in Scripture, that this Law of Divorce 
hath many wise and charitable ends besides the being 
suffer'd for hardness of heart; which is indeed no 
end, but an accident hapning through the whole Law; 
which gives to good men right and to bad men, who 
abuse right under false pretences, gives only 
sufferance.  Now although Christ express no other 
reasons here, but only what was suffer'd, it nothing 
follows that this Law had no other reason to be 
permitted but for hardness of heart.  The Scripture 
seldom or never in one place sets down all the 
reasons of what it grants or commands, especially 
when it talks to enemies and tempters.  St. <i>Paul</i> 
permitting Marriage, 1 <i>Cor.</i> 7. seems to permit even 
that also for hardness of heart only, lest we should 
run into fornication; yet no intelligent man thence 
concludes Marriage allow'd in the Gospel only to avoid 
an evil, because no other end is there exprest.  Thus 
<i>Moses</i> of necessity suffer'd many to put away their 
wives for hardness of heart; but enacted the Law of 
Divorce doubtless for other good cause, not for this 
only sufferance.  He permitted not Divorce by law as 
an evil, for that was impossible to divine Law, but 
permitted by accident the evil of them who divorc'd 
against the Law's intention undiscoverably.  This also 
may be thought not improbable, that Christ, stirr'd 
up in his spirit against these tempting <i>Pharisees,</i> 
answer'd them in a certain form of indignation usual 
among good authors; wherby the question, or the 
truth is not directly answer'd, but something which 
is fitter for them, who ask, to hear.  So in the 
<i>Ecclesiastical</i> stories, one demanding <i>how God 
imploy'd himself before the world was made</i>? had 
answer, <i>that he was making hell for curious 
questioners.</i>  Another (and <i>Libanius</i> the Sophist, as I 
remember) asking in derision some Christian, <i>What 
the Carpenter,</i> meaning our Saviour, <i>was doing, now 
that Julian so prevail'd</i>? had it return'd him, <i>that the 
Carpenter was making a coffin for the Apostate.</i>  So 
Christ being demanded maliciously why <i>Moses</i> made 
the Law of Divorce, answers them in a vehement 
scheme, not telling them the cause why he made it, 
but what was fittest to be told them, <i>that for the 
hardness of their hearts he suffer'd them</i> to abuse it.  
And albeit <i>Mark</i> say not <i>he suffer'd you,</i> but <i>to you 
he wrote this precept;</i> <i>Mark</i> may be warrantably 
expounded by <i>Matthew</i> the larger.  And whether he 
suffer'd, or gave precept, being all one as was heard, 
it changes not the trope of indignation, fittest 
account for such askers.  Next, <i>for the hardness of 
your hearts, to you he wrote this precept,</i> infers not 
therfore <i>for this cause only he wrote it,</i> as was 
parallell'd by other Scirptures.  Lastly, It may be 
worth the observing, that Christ speaking to the 
<i>Pharisees,</i> does not say in general <i>that for hardness 
of heart he gave this precept,</i> but <i>you he suffer'd, 
and to you he gave this precept for your hardness of 
heart.</i>  It cannot be easily thought that Christ here 
included all the children of <i>Israel</i> under the person 
of these tempting <i>Pharisees,</i> but that he conceals; 
wherfore he gave the better sort of them this Law, 
and expresses by saying emphatically <i>To you</i> how he 
gave it to the worse, such as the <i>Pharisees</i> best 
represented, that is to say, <i>for the hardness of your 
hearts:</i> as indeed to wicked man and hardned hearts 
he gives the whole Law and the Gospel also, to 
harden them the more.  Thus many ways it may 
orthodoxally be understood how God or <i>Moses</i> 
suffer'd such as the demanders were, to divorce for 
hardness of heart.  Wheras the vulgar Expositor, 
beset with contradictions and absurdities round and 
resolving at any peril to make an exposition of it, as 
there is nothing more violent and boistrous than a 
reverend ignorance in fear to be convicted, rushes 
brutely and impetuously against all the principles 
both of Nature, Piety, and moral Goodness; and in the 
fury of his literal expounding overturns them all.<br><img

	<i>But from the beginning it was not so.</i> ]  Not how 
from the beginning?  Do they suppose that men 
might not divorce at all, not necessarily, not 
deliberately, except for Adultery, but that some law, 
like canon law, presently attacht them both before 
and after the flood, till stricter <i>Moses</i> came, and with 
law brought licence into the world? that were a fancy 
indeed to smile at.  Undoubtedly as to point of judicial 
Law, Divorce was more permissive from the 
beginning before <i>Moses</i> than under <i>Moses.</i>  But from 
the beginning, that is to say, by the institution in 
<i>Paradise,</i> it was not intended that Matrimony should 
dissolve for every trivial cause, as you <i>Pharisees</i> 
accustom.  But that it was not thus suffer'd from the 
beginning ever since the race of men corrupted and 
Laws were made, he who will affirm, must have found 
out other antiquities than are yet known.  Besides, 
we must consider now, what can be so as from the 
beginning, not only what should be so.  In the 
beginning, had men continu'd perfect, it had been 
just that all things should have remain'd, as they 
began to <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve.</i>  But after that the Sons of 
Men grew violent and injurious, it alter'd the lore of 
justice, and put the government of things into a new 
frame.  While man and woman were both perfect each 
to other, there needed no Divorce; but when they 
both degenerated to imperfection, and oft-times 
grew to be an intolerable evil each to other, then Law 
more justly did permit the alienating of that evil 
which mistake made proper, than it did the 
appropriating of that good  which Nature at first 
made common.  For if the absence of outward good be 
not so bad as the presence of close evil, and that 
propriety, whether by covenant or possession, be 
but the attainment of some outward good, it is more 
natural and righteous that the Law should sever us 
from an intimate evil, than appropriate any outward 
good to us from the Community of nature.  The 
Gospel indeed tending ever to that which is 
perfectest, aim'd at the restorement of all things as 
they were in the beginning, and therfore all things 
were in common to those primitive Christians in the 
Acts, which Ananias and Sapphira dearly felt.  That 
custom also continu'd more or less till the time of 
<i>Justin Martyr,</i> as may be read in his second Apology, 
which might be writ after that act of communion 
perhaps some forty years above a hundred.  But who 
will be the man that shall introduce this kind of 
Commonwealth, as Christianity now goes?  If then 
Marriage must be as in the beginning, the persons 
that marry must be such as then were; the 
institution must make good, in some tolerable sort, 
what it promises to either party.  If not, it is but 
madness to drag this one Ordinance back to the 
beginning, and draw down all other to the present 
necessity and condition, far from the beginning, even 
to the tolerating of extortions and oppressions.  
Christ only told us that from the beginning it was not 
so; that is to say, not so as the <i>Pharisees</i> manur'd the 
business; did not command us that it should be 
forcibly so again in all points, as at the beginning; or 
so at least in our intentions and desires, but so in 
execution, as reason and present nature can bear.  
Although we are not to seek, that the institution it 
self from the first beginning was never but 
conditional, as all Covenants are: because thus and 
thus, therfore so and so; if not thus, then not so.  
Then moreover was perfectest to fulfil each Law in it 
self; now is perfectest in this estate of things, to ask 
of charity how much law may be fulfill'd: else the 
fulfilling oft-times is the greatest breaking.  If any 
therfore demand, which is now most perfection, to 
ease an extremity by Divorce, or to enrage and fester 
it by the grievous observance of a miserable Wedloc, 
I am not destitute to say which is most perfection, 
(although some who believe they think favourably of 
Divorce, esteem it only venial to infirmity.)  Him I 
hold more in the way to perfection who forgoes an 
unfit, ungodly, and discordant Wedloc, to live 
according to peace and love, and God's institution in 
a fitter choice, than he who debars himself the happy 
experience of all godly, which is peaceful 
conversation in his family, to live a contentious, and 
unchristian life not to be avoided, in temptations not 
to be liv'd in, only for the false keeping of a most 
unreal nullity, a Marriage that hath no affinity with 
God's intention, a daring phantasm, a meer toy of 
terror awing weak sense, to the lamentable 
superstition of ruining themselves; the remedy 
wherof God in his Law vouchsafes us.  Which not to 
dare use, he warranting, is not our perfection, is our 
infirmity, our little faith, our timorous and low 
conceit of Charity: and in them who force us, it is 
their masking pride and vanity, to seem holier and 
more circumspect than God.  So far is it that we need 
impute to him infirmity, who thus divorces: since the 
rule of perfection is not so much that which was done 
in the beginning, as that which now is nearest to the 
rule of charity.  This is the greatest, the perfectest, 
the highest commandment.<p><img

	<i>And I say unto you.</i> ]  That this restrictive 
denouncement of Christ contradicts and refutes that 
permissive precept of <i>Moses,</i> common Expositors 
themselves disclaim: and that it does not traverse 
from the Closet of Conscience to the Courts of Civil or 
Canon Law, with any Christian rightly commenc'd, 
requires not long evincing.  If Christ then did not 
here check permissive <i>Moses,</i> nor did reduce 
Matrimony to the beginning more than all other 
things, as the reason of man's condition could bear, 
we would know precisely what it was which he did, 
and what the end was of his declaring thus austerely 
against Divorce.  For this is a confest Oracle in Law, 
that he who looks not at the intention of a Precept, 
the more superstitious he is of the letter, the more 
he misinterprets.  Was it to shame <i>Moses</i>? that had 
been monstrous: or all those purest Ages of Israel, to 
whom the Permission was granted: that were as 
incredible.  Or was it that he who came to abrogate 
the burden of Law, not the equity, should put this 
yoke upon a blameless person, to league himself in 
chains with a begirting mischief, not to separate till 
death?  He who taught us that no man puts a piece of 
new cloth upon an ond garment, nor new wine into 
old bottles, that he should sew this patch of 
strictness upon the old apparel of our frailty, to 
make a rent more incurable, whenas in all other 
amendments his doctrine still charges, that regard 
be had to the garment, and to the vessel, what it can 
endue; this were an irregular and single piece of 
rigour, not only sounding disproportion to the whole 
Gospel, but outstretching the most rigorous nerves 
of Law and Rigour it self.  No other end therfore can 
be left imaginable of this excessive restraint, but to 
bridle those erroneous and licentious postillers the 
Pharisees; not by telling them what may be done in 
necessity, but what censure they deserve who 
divorce abusively, which their Tetrarch had done.  
And as the offence was in one extreme, so the 
rebuke, to bring more efficaciously to a rectitude and 
mediocrity, stands not in the middle way of duty, but 
in the other extreme.  Which art of powerful 
reclaiming, wisest men have also taught in their 
ethical Precepts and Gnomologies, resembling it, as 
when we bend a crooked wand the contrary way; not 
that it should stand so bent, but that the 
overbending might reduce it to a straitness by its 
own reluctance.  And as the Physician cures him who 
hath taken down poison, not by the <a name="mean">middling</a> temper 
of nourishment, but by the other extreme of 
Antidote, so Christ administers here a sharp and 
corrosive sentence against a foul and putrid licence; 
not to eat into the flesh, but into the sore.  And 
knowing that our Divines through all their Comments 
make no scruple, where they please, to soften the 
high and vehement speeches of our Saviour, which 
they call Hyperboles; why in this one Text should 
they be such crabbed Masorites of the letter, as not 
to mollify a transcendance of literal rigidity, which 
they confess to find often elsewhere in his manner of 
delivery, but must make their exposition here such 
an obdurate Cyclops, to have but one eye for this 
Text, and that only open to cruelty and enthralment, 
such as no divine or human Law before ever heard 
of?  No, let the foppish Canonist, with his fardel of 
matrimonial cases, go and be vendible where men be 
so unhappy as to cheapen him: the words of Christ 
shall be asserted from such elemental Notaries, and 
resolv'd by the now-only lawgiving mouth of 
charity; which may be done undoubtedly by 
understanding them as follows.<br><img

	<i>Whosoever shall put away his wife.</i> ]  That is to 
say, shall so put away as the Propounders of this 
question, the <i>Pharisees,</i> were wont to do, and 
covertly defended <i>Herod</i> for so doing; whom to 
rebuke, our Saviour here mainly intends, and not to 
determine all the cases of Divorce, as appears by St. 
<i>Paul.</i>  Whosoever shall put away, either violently 
without mutual consent for urgent reasons, or 
conspiringly by plot of lust, or cunning malice, shall 
put away for any sudden mood, or contingency of 
disagreement, which is not daily practice, but may 
blow soon over, and be reconcil'd, except it be 
Fornication; whosoever shall put away rashly, as his 
choler prompts him, without due time of 
deliberating, and think his Conscience dischar'd ony 
by the bill of Divorce given, and the outward Law 
satisfy'd; whosoever, lastly, shall put away his Wife, 
that is a Wife indeed, and not in name only, such a 
one who both can and is willing to be a meet help 
toward the chief ends of Marriage both civil and 
sanctify'd, except fornication be the cause, that Man, 
or that Pair, commit Adultery.  Not he who puts away 
by mutual consent, with all the considerations and 
respects of humanity and gentleness, without 
malicious or lustful drift.  Not he who after sober and 
cool experience, and long debate within himself, puts 
away, whom though he cannot love or suffer as a 
Wife, with that sincere affection that Marriage 
requires, yet loves at least with that civility and 
goodness, as not to keep her under a neglected and 
unwelcome residence, where nothing can be hearty, 
and not being, it must needs be both unjoyous, and 
injurious to any perceiving person so detain'd, and 
more injurious than to be freely, and upon good 
terms dismist.  Nor doth he put away adulterously 
who complains of causes rooted in immutable nature, 
utter unfitness, utter disconformity, not conciliable, 
because not to be amended without a miracle.  Nor he 
who puts away an unquenchable vexation from his 
bosom, and flies an evil than which a greater cannot 
befall human society.  Nor he who puts away with the 
full suffrage and applause of his conscience, not 
relying on the written bill of Law, but claiming by 
faith and fulness of perswasion the rights and 
promises of God's institution, of which he finds 
himself in a mistaken wedloc defrauded.  Doubtless 
this man hath bail enough to be no Adulterer, giving 
Divorce for these causes.<br><img

	<i>His Wife.</i> ]  This word is not to be idle here, a meer 
word without a sense, much less a fallacious word 
signifying contrary to what it pretends; but 
faithfully signifies a Wife, that is, a comfortable help 
and society, as God instituted; does not signify 
deceitfully under this name, an intolerable 
adversary, not a helpless, unaffectionate and sullen 
mass, whose very company represents the visible 
and exactest figure of loneliness it self.  Such an 
associate he who puts away, divorces not a wife, but 
disjoins a nullity which God never join'd, if she be 
neither willing, nor to her proper and requisite 
duties sufficient, as the words of God institute her.  
And this also is Bucer's explication of this place.<br><img

	<i>Except it be for fornication, or saving for the 
cause of fornication,</i> as <i>Matt.</i> 5. ]  This declares what 
kind of causes our Saviour meant; fornication being 
no natural and perpetual cause, but only accidental 
and temporary; therfore shews that head of causes 
from whence it is excepted, to be meant of the same 
sort.  For exceptions are not logically deduc'd from a 
divers kind, as to say whoso puts away for any 
natural cause except Fornication, the exception 
would want salt.  And if they understand it, whoso 
for any cause whatever, they cast themselves; 
granting Divorce for frigidity a natural cause of their 
own allowing, though not here exprest, and for 
desertion without infidelity, whenas he who marries, 
as they allow him for desertion, deserts as well as is 
deserted, and finally puts away for another cause 
besides Adultery.  It will with all due reason therfore 
be thus better understood, whoso puts away for any 
accidental and temporary causes, except one of them, 
which is fornication.  Thus this exception finds out 
the causes from whence it is excepted, to be of the 
same kind, that is casual, not continual.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	<i>Saving for the cause of fornication.</i> ]  The New 
Testament, though it be said originally writ in <i>Greek,</i> 
yet hath nothing near so many <i>Atticisms</i> as 
<i>Hebraisms,</i> and <i>Syriacisms,</i> which was the Majesty of 
God, not fitting the tongue of Scripture to a <i>Gentilish</i> 
Idiom, but in a princely manner offering to them as 
to <i>Gentiles</i> and Foreigners grace and mercy, though 
not in foreign words, yet in a foreign stile that might 
induce them to the fountains; and though their 
calling were high and happy, yet still to acknowledge 
God's ancient people their betters, and that language 
the Metropolitan language.  He therfore who thinks to 
Scholiaze upon the Gospel, though Greek, according 
to his <i>Greek</i> Analogies, and hath not been Auditor to 
the <i>Oriental</i> dialects, shall want in the heat of his 
Analysis no accommodation to stumble.  In this place, 
as the 5th of Matth. reads it, Saving for the cause of 
fornication, the <i>Greek,</i> such as it is, sounds it except 
for the word, report, speech, or proportion of 
fornication.  In which regard, with other 
inducements, many ancient and learned Writers 
have understood this exception, as comprehending 
any fault equivalent and proportional to fornication.  
But truth is, the Evangelist here <i>Hebraizes,</i> taking 
word or speech for cause or matter in the common 
Eastern phrase, meaning perhaps no more than if he 
had said for fornication, as in this 19th chapter.  And 
yet the word is found in the 5th of <i>Exodus</i> also 
signifying Proportion; where the <i>Israelites</i> are 
commanded to do their tasks, the matter of each day 
in his day.  A task we know is a proportion of work 
not doing the same thing absolutely every day, but 
so much.  Wherby it may be doubtful yet, whether 
here be not excepted not only fornication it self, but 
other causes equipollent, and proportional to 
fornication.  Which very word also to understand 
rightly, we must of necessity have recourse again to 
the <i>Hebrew.</i>  For in the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> sense by 
fornication is meant the common prostitution of body 
for sale.  So that they who are so exact for the letter, 
shall be dealt with by the Lexicon, and the 
Etymologicon too if they please, and must be bound 
to forbid divorce for adultery also, until it come to 
open whoredom and trade, like that for which 
Claudius divorc'd Messalina.  Since therfore they take 
not here the word fornication in the common 
significance, for an open exercise in the stews, but 
grant Divorce for one single act of privatest 
Adultery, notwithstanding that the word speaks a 
public and notorious frequency of fact, not without 
price; we may reason with as good leave, and as little 
straining to the text, that our Saviour on set purpose 
chose this word <i>Fornication,</i> improperly apply'd to 
the lapse of Adultery, that we might not think our 
selves bound from all Divorce, except when that fault 
hath been actually committed.  For the language of 
Scripture signifies by fornication (and others besides 
St. <i>Austin</i> so expounded it) not only the trespass of 
Body, nor perhaps that between married persons, 
unless in a degree or quality as shameless as the 
Bordello;  but signifies also any notable disobedience, 
or intractable carriage of the Wife to the Husband, as 
<i>Judg.</i> 19. 2. wherof at large in the <i>Doctrine of 
Divorce,</i> l. 2. c. 18.  Secondly, signifiest the apparent 
alienation of mind not to Idolatry, (which may seem 
to answer the act of Adultery) but far on this side, to 
any point of will-worship, though to the true God; 
sometimes it notes the love of earthly things, or 
worldly pleasures, though in a right Believer, 
sometimes the least suspicion of unwitting Idolatry.  
As <i>Numb.</i> 15. 39. wilful disobedience to any the least 
of God's Commandment is call'd fornication, <i>Psal.</i> 73. 
26, 27.  A distrust only in God, and withdrawing 
from that nearness of zeal and confidence which 
ought to be , is call'd fornication.  We may be sure it 
could not import thus much less than Idolatry in the 
borrow'd metaphor between God and Man, unless it 
signify'd as much less than Adultery in the ordinary 
acceptation between Man and Wife.  Add also, that 
there was no need our Saviour should grant divorce 
for Adultery, it being death by Law, and Law then in 
force.  Which was the cause why <i>Joseph</i> sought to put 
away his betrothed Wife privately, lest he should 
make her an example of captial punishment, as 
learnedest Expounders affirm, <i>Herod</i> being a great 
zealot of the Mosaic Law, and the <i>Pharisees</i> great 
masters of the Text, as the woman taken in Adultery 
doubtless had cause to fear.  Or if they can prove it 
was neglected, which they cannot do, why did our 
Saviour shape his Answer to the corruption of that 
age, and not rather tell them of their neglect?  If 
they say he came not to meddle with their 
Judicatures, much less then was it in his thought to 
make them new ones, or that Divorce should be 
judicially restrain'd in a stricter manner by these 
his words, more than Adultery judicially acquitted 
by those his words to the Adultress.  His sentence 
doth no more by Law forbid Divorce here, than by 
Law it doth absolve Adultery there.  To them 
therfore who have drawn this yoke upon Christians 
from his words thus wrested, nothing remains but 
the guilt of a presumption and perverseness, which 
will be hard for them to answer.  Thus much that the 
word <i>Fornication</i> is to be understood as the Language 
of Christ understands it, for a constant alienation 
and disaffection of mind, or for the continual practice 
of disobedience and crossness from the duties of love 
and peace; that is in sum, when to be a tolerable Wife 
is either naturally not in their power, or obstinately 
not in their will: and this Opinion also is St. <i>Austin's,</i> 
lest it should hap to be suspected of novelty.  Yet 
grant the thing here meant were only Adultery, the 
reason of things will afford more to our assertion, 
than did the reason of words.  For why is Divorce 
unlawful but only for Adultery? because, say they, 
that crime only breaks the Matrimony. But this, I 
reply, the Institution it self gainsays: for that which 
is most contrary to the words and meaning of the 
Institution, that most breaks the Matrimony; but a 
perpetual unmeetness and unwillingness to all the 
duties of Help, of Love, and Tranquillity, is most 
contrary to the words and meaning of the 
Institution; that therfore much more breaks 
Matrimony than the act of Adultery, though 
repeated.  For this, as it is not felt, nor troubles him 
who perceives it not, so being perceiv'd, may be soon 
repented, soon amended, soon, if it can be pardon'd, 
may be redeem'd with the more ardent love and 
duty in her who hath the pardon.  But this natural 
unmeetness both cannot be unknown long, and ever 
after cannot be amended, if it be natural, and will 
not, if it be far gone obstinate.  So that wanting aught 
in the instant to be as great a breach as adultery, it 
gains it in the perpetuity to be greater.  Next, 
Adultery does not exclude her other fitness, her 
other pleasingness; she may be otherwise both loving 
and prevalent, as many Adulteresses be; but in this 
general unfitness or alienation she can be nothing to 
him that can please.  In Adultery nothing is given 
from the Husband, which he misses, or enjoys the 
less, as it may be suttly given: but this unfitness 
defrauds him of the whole contentment which is 
sought in Wedloc.  And what benefit to him, though 
nothing be given by the stealth of Adultery to 
another, if that which there is to give, whether it be 
solace, or society, be not such as may justly content 
him? and so not only deprives him of what it should 
give him, but gives him sorrow and affliction, which 
it did not owe him.  Besides, is Adultery the greatest 
breach of Matrimony in respect of the offence to God, 
or of the injury to Man?  If in the former, then other 
sins may offend God more, and sooner cause him to 
disunite his servant from being one flesh with such 
an offender.  If in respect of the latter, other injuries 
are demonstrated therin more heavy to man's 
nature than the iterated act of Adultery.  God 
therfore, in his wisdom, would not so dispose his 
remedies, as to provide them for the less injuries, 
and not allow them for the greater.  Thus is won both 
from the word Fornication, and the reason of 
Adultery, that the exception of Divorce is not limited 
to that act, but enlarg'd to the causes above 
specify'd.<br><img

	<i>And whoso marrieth her which is put away, doth 
commit adultery.</i> ]  By this Clause alone, if by 
nothing else,we may assure us, that Christ intended 
not to deliver here the whole doctrine of Divorce, but 
only to condemn abuses.  Otherwise to marry after 
Desertion, which the Apostle, and the reformed 
Churches at this day permit, is here forbid, as 
Adultery.  Be she never so wrongfully deserted, or 
put away, as the Law then suffer'd, if thus forsaken 
and expulst, she accept the refuge and protection of 
any honester man who would love her better and 
give her self in Marriage to him, by what the letter 
guides us, it shall be present Adultery to them both.  
This is either harsh and cruel, or all the Churches 
teaching as they do the contrary, are loose and 
remiss; besides that the Apostle himself stands 
deeply fin'd in a contradiction against our Saviour.  
What shall we make of this? what rather the common 
interpreter can make of it, for they be his own 
markets, let him now try; let him try which way he 
can wind in his Vertumnian distinctions and 
evasions, if his canonical Gabardine of text and letter 
do not now sit too close about him, and pinch his 
activity; which if I err not, hath here hamper'd it 
self in a spring fit for those who put their confidence 
in Alphabets.  <i>Spanheim</i> a writer of Evangelic Doubts, 
comes now and confesses that our Saviour's words 
are to be limited beyond the limitation there exprest, 
and excepted beyond their own exception, as not 
speaking of what happen'd rarely, but what most 
commonly.  Is it so rare, <i>Spanheim,</i> to be deserted? 
or was it then so rare to put away injuriously, that a 
person so hatefully expell'd, should to the heaping of 
more injury be turn'd like an infectious thing out of 
all Marriage-fruition upon pain of Adultery, as not 
considerable to the brevity of this half sentence?  Of 
what then speaks our Saviour? of that collusion, 
saith he, which was then most frequent among the 
Jews of changing wives and husbands, through 
inconstancy and unchaste desires.  Colluders your 
selves, as violent to this Law of God by your 
unmerciful binding, as the <i>Pharisees</i> by their 
unbounded loosening!  Have thousands of Christian 
souls perish'd as to this life, and God knows what 
hath betided their Consciences, for want of this 
healing explantion; and is it now at last obscurely 
drawn forth, only to cure a scratch, and leave the 
main wound spouting?  Whosoever putteth away his 
wife, except for fornication, committeth adultery.  
That shall be spoke of all ages, and all men, though 
never so justly otherwise mov'd to Divorce: In the 
very next breath, <i>And whoso marrieth her which is 
put away, committeth adultery:</i> the men are new and 
miraculous, they tell you now you are to limit it to 
that age, when it was in fashion to chop matrimonies; 
and must be meant of him who puts away with his 
wife's consent through the lightness and leudness of 
them both.  By what rule of Logic, or indeed of 
Reason, is our commission to understand the 
Antecedent one way and the Consequent another? 
for in that habitude this whole verse may be 
considered: or at least first is absolutely true, the 
other not, but must be limited to a certain time and 
custom; which is no less than to say they are both 
false?  For in this compound axiom, be the parts 
never so many, if one of them do but falter, and be 
not equally absolute and general, the rest are all 
false.  If therfore that he who marries her which is 
put away commits adultery, be not generally true, 
neither is it generally true that he commits adultery 
who puts away for other cause then fornication.  And 
if the marrying her which is put away, must be 
understood limited, which they cannot but yield it 
must, with the same limitation must be understood 
the putting away.  Thus doth the common exposition 
confound it self, and justify this which is here 
brought; that our Saviour as well in the first part of 
this sentence as in the second, prohibited only such 
Divorces as the Jews then made through malice or 
through plotted licence, not those which are for 
necessary and just causes; where charity and 
wisdom disjoins, that which not God, but Error and 
Disaster join'd.<br><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">
	And there is yet to this our exposition, a stronger 
siding friend, than any can be an adversary, unless 
St. <i>Paul</i> be doubted, who repeating a command 
concerning Divorce, 1 <i>Cor.</i> 7. which is agreed by 
Writers to be the same with this of our Saviour, and 
appointing that the wife remain unmarried, or be 
reconcil'd to her husband, leaves it infallible that our 
Saviour spake chiefly against putting away for casual 
and choleric disagreements, or any other cause 
which may with human patience and wisdom be 
reconcil'd; not hereby meaning to hale and dash 
together the irreconcileable aversations of nature, 
nor to tie up a faultless person like a Parricide, as it 
were into one sack with an enemy, to be his causeless 
tormenter and executioner the length of a long life.  
Lastly, let this sentence of Christ be understood how 
it will, yet that it was never intended for a judicial 
Law, to be inforc'd by the Magistrate, besides that 
the office of our Saviour had no such purpose in the 
Gospel, this latter part of the sentence may assure 
us, And whoso marrieth her who is put away, 
commits adultery.  Shall the exception for Adultery 
belong to this clause or not?  If not, it would be 
strange, that he who marries a Woman really 
divorc'd for Adultery, as Christ permitted, should 
become an Adulterer by marrying one who is now no 
other man's Wife, himself being also free, who might 
by this means reclaim her from common Whoredom.  
And if the exception must belong hither, then it 
follows that he who marries an Adultress divorc'd 
commits no Adultery; which would soon discover to 
us what an absurd and sensless piece of injustice this 
would be to make a civil Statute of in penal Courts: 
wherby the Adultress put away may marry another 
safely, and without a crime to him that marries her; 
but the innocent and wrongfully divorc'd shall not 
marry again without the guilt of Adultery both to 
her self and to her second husband.  This saying of 
Christ therfore cannot be made a temporal Law, were 
it but for this reason.  Nor is it easy to say what 
coherence there is at all in it from the letter, to any 
perfect sense not obnoxious to some absurdity, and 
seems much less agreeable to whatever else of the 
Gospel is left us written; doubtless by our Saviour 
spoken in that fierceness and abstruse intricacy, 
first to amuse his tempters, and admonish in general 
the abusers of that Mosaic Law; next, to let Herod 
know a second knower of his unlawful act, though the 
Baptist were beheaded; last, that his Disciples and all 
good men might learn to expound him in this place, 
as in all other his precepts, not by the written letter, 
but by that unerring paraphrase of Christian Love 
and Charity, which is the sum of all commands, and 
the perfection.<p><img

Ver. 10.  <i>His Disciples say unto him, If the case of 
the man be so with his Wife, it is not good to marry.</i><p><img
src="../../resources/dot_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="8">

	This verse I add, to leave no objection behind 
unanswer'd: for some may think, if this our 
Saviour's sentence be so fair, as not commanding 
aught that patience or nature cannot brook, why 
then did the disciples murmur and say, <i>it is not good 
to marry</i>?  I answer, that the Disciples had been 
longer bred up under the Pharisaean Doctrine, than 
under that of Christ, and so no marvel though they 
yet retain'd the infection of loving old licentious 
customs; no marvel though they thought it hard 
they might not for any offence that throughly 
anger'd them, divorce a Wife, as well as put away a 
Servant, since it was but giving her a Bill, as they 
were taught.  Secondly, it was no unwonted thing 
with them not to understand our Saviour in matters 
far easier.  So that be it granted their conceit of this 
text was the same which is now commonly conceiv'd, 
according to the usual rate of their capacity then, it 
will not hurt a better interpretation.  But why did 
not Christ, seeing their error, inform them? for good 
cause; it was his profest method not to teach them all 
things at all times, but each thing in due place and 
season.  Christ said, <i>Luke</i> 22. <i>that he who had not 
sword should sell his garment and buy one:</i> the 
Disciples took it in a manifest wrong sense, yet our 
Saviour did not there inform them better.  He told 
them <i>it was easier for a Camel to go through a 
needle's eye, than a rich man in at heaven-gate.</i>  
They were amaz'd exceedingly: he explain'd himself 
to mean <i>of those who trust in riches,</i> <i>Mark</i> 10.  They 
were amazed than out of measure, for so <i>Mark</i> 
relates it; as if his explaining had increas'd their 
amazement in such a plain case, and which concern'd 
so nearly their calling to be inform'd in.  Good reason 
therfore, if Christ at that time did not stand 
amplifying, to the thick prejudice and tradition 
wherin they were, this question of more difficulty, 
and less concernment to any perhaps of them in 
particular.  Yet did he not omit to sow within them 
the seeds of a sufficient determining, against the 
time that his promis'd Spirit should bring all things 
to their memory.  He had declar'd in their hearing 
not long before, how distant he was from abolishing 
the Law it self of Divorce; he had referr'd them to the 
institution; and after all this, gives them a set 
answer, from which they might collect what was 
clear enough, that all men cannot receive all sayings, 
ver. 11.  If such regard be had to each man's 
receiving of Marriage or single life, what can arise 
that the same christian regard should not be had in 
most necessary Divorce?  All which instructed both 
them and us, that it beseem'd his Disciples to learn 
the deciding of this question, which hath nothing 
new in it, first by the institution, then by the 
general grounds of Religion, not by a particular 
saying here or there, temper'd and levell'd only to 
an incident occasion, the riddance of a tempting 
assault.  For what can this be but weak and shallow 
apprehension, to forsake the standard principles of 
institution, faith, and charity; then to be blank and 
various at every occurrence in Scripture, and in a 
cold Spasm of scruple, to rear peculiar doctrines 
upon the place, that shall bid the gray authority of 
most unchangable and sovereign Rules to stand by 
and be contradicted?  Thus to this Evangelic precept 
of famous difficulty, which for these many ages 
weakly understood, and violently put in practice, 
hath made a shambles rather than an ordinance of 
Matrimony, I am firm a truer exposition cannot be 
given.  If this or that argument here us'd, please not 
every one, there is no scarcity of arguments, any 
half of them will suffice.  Or should they all fail, as 
Truth it self can fail as soon, I should content me 
with the institution alone to wage this controversy, 
and not distrust to evince.  If any need it not, the 
happier; yet Christians ought to study earnestly 
what may be another's need.  But if, as mortal 
mischances are, some hap to need it, let them be sure 
they abuse not, and give God his thanks, who hath 
reviv'd this remedy, not too late for them, and 
scower'd off an inveterate misexposition from the 
Gospel: a work not to perish by the vain breath or 
doom of this age.  Our next industry shall be, under 
the same guidance, to try with what fidelity that 
remaining passage in the <i>Epistles</i> touching this 
matter, hath been commented.
