The 1673 edition of <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems &amp;c. Upon SeveralOccasions</span> includes the preface \"Anno Aetatis 19\" and Milton was nineteen inJuly 1628, the start of the summer vacation. This early date suggests a highlyprecocious and advanced undergraduate. <ahref=\"../bibliography/i-k/text.shtml#william_kerrigan\" target=\"main\">William Kerrigan, JohnRumrich and Stephen Fallon</a> praise Milton for being \"serious enough to be draftingat age nineteen a life plan dedicated to . . . a noble epic subject, an answerablestyle, a unique access to the divine secrets of the universe, and an enrapturedaudience\" (11). <a href=\"../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#barbara_lewalski\"target=\"main\">Barbara Lewalski</a> calls the prolusion \"remarkably advanced\" (31).</p><p class=\"next\">Recently, Gordon Campbell and Thomas N. Corns, in their 2008biography <a href=\"../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#campbell_corns\"target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">John Milton: Life, Work and Thought</span></a>argue convincingly for a later date&mdash;the summer of 1631, when Milton was apostgraduate student pursuing an M.A. (58-9). This later date is not certain but itdoes promise to solve a few nagging problems. First, it is difficult to reconcileMilton\'s \"starring role\" as \"Father\" of the vacation exercise with undergraduatestatus. <a href=\"../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#shawcross_form\">John T.Shawcross</a> supports Campbell and Corns\' dating by proposing that the line \"all ofus Sophisters,\" which would require the poem\'s date be 1628, when Milton was asophister, has been mistranslated and should read \"all our Sophisters.\" Thisalternate translation thus \"does not include him but calls upon many participants inthe exercise and in his audience. He is the \'Dictator\' on this occasion, placing him,it seems likely, in a superior position\" (182 n1). Milton\'s appointment to thisstarring role, Shawcross intimates, most likely results from a postgraduatestatus.</p><p class=\"next\">Campbell and Corns tread new territory, however, in theirinvestigations into the content of the prolusion itself. At the beginning, Miltonnotes that the exercises had not been held the previous year, and Cambell and Cornshave found records only indicate the exercises were cancelled in 1630&mdash;due to theplague. With regard to the prolusion\'s catalog of bird titles, moreover, the pairinvestigated allusions to names of contemporary students, concluding that \"the birdsonly begin to flock in large numbers if the date of the prolusion is 1631\" (59). </p><p class=\"next\">Finally, <span class=\"booktitle\">Prolusion VI</span>\'s assertion thatMilton was appointed \"Father\" due to the abrupt departure of the original \"leader andcommander of the Sophisters\" can situate the poem within Milton\'s postgraduate careerat Cambridge. Suggesting that the leader was removed from his position due to hisparticipation in a prank, the prolusion describes a stunt in which fifty studentsdestroy an aqueduct, \"laying siege to the town\" and holding Barwell Field ransom withthirst. Unable to find a corresponding record, Campbell and Corns conjecture that theprolusion cites a drunken encounter of five students with the authorities ofChesterton, a town near to Barwell Field, in April 1631 (59). Within this framework,the aqueduct\'s destruction equates to a drunken tumble into King\'s Ditch andurination in the river. Though their analysis mines profoundly for evidence, thepair\'s finding have produced the only satisfactory historical foundation for thestory to date. </p><p class=\"next\">The most recent analysis of \"At a Vacation Exercise\" is M.K.Sugimura\'s 2009 book <a href=\"../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#n.k._sugimura\"target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Matter of Glorious Trial: Spiritual andMaterial Substance in Paradise Lost</span></a>, which favors Campbell and Corn\'s 1631date. Given this contemporary critical inclination and Campbell and Corn\'spersuasively detailed argument, we will assume Milton composed and delivered the poemon 8 July 1631. </p><p class=\"next\"><a href=\"../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#shawcross_form\"target=\"main\">John T. Shawcross</a> supports Campbell and Corns\' dating by proposingthat the line with which the pair most struggles&mdash;\"all of us Sophisters,\" which wouldrequire the poem\'s date be 1628, when Milton was a sophister&mdash;has been mistranslatedfrom the Latin and should read \"all our Sophisters.\" This alternate translation thus\"does not include him but calls upon many participants in the exercise and in hisaudience. He is the \'Dictator\' on this occasion, placing him, it seems likely, in asuperior position\" (182 n1). Milton\'s appointment to this high position, Shawcressintimates, most likely results from a postgraduate station. </p><p class=\"next\">Milton employed the power conferred upon him by his \"Father\" role toembed an unlikely English poem into a pre-established \"salting\" tradition, whichultimately portrays \"At a Vacation Exercise\" as a calculated act of self-promotion&mdash;apromise for future attainment of new poetic heights. Preceding and accompanying \"At aVacation Exercise,\" <span class=\"booktitle\">Prolusion VI</span> would have adhered tothe tradition of the \"salting\" genre of oration, in which an undergraduate delivereda speech subject to judgment by his classmates. \"Salting\" ruled that if the oratorypleased its audience, the speaker earned a cup of spiced gruel; if it disappointed,he would be presented a \"salted\" and unsavory drink. By the 1620s, CambridgeUniversity had developed its own particular salting practices, in which \"a master ofceremonies pretended to be a college tutor, and so became the \'father\' of his \'sons,\'the new students\" (Campbell and Corns, 60). A dialogue between \"Father\" and \"son\" ofa lewd and mildly insulting nature, Cambridge\'s salting humorously envisioned a modeof interaction forbidden students and tutors by decorum and provided an unlikelycontext for the eruption of claims to future poetic eminence that \"At a VacationExercise\" entails. </p><p class=\"next\">Resembling past and subsequent outbursts of augury, however, thetextual context in which \"At a Vacation Exercise\" anticipates Milton\'s future depictshis evolving strategy for introducing himself as an English epic poet. As early as1629 with <a href=\"../elegiarum/elegy_1/text.shtml\" target=\"main\"><spanclass=\"booktitle\">Elegy VI</span></a>, Milton aired his intention to become England\'s\"bardic Poet-Priest\" (Lewalski, 38). Written in Latin and closely adhering to theform of Latin elegies, Elegy VI adheres to the verse epistle format while expressingdesire to transcend the elegy\'s typical subjects and \"sing the heaven-descendedking.\" We see signs of this ambition also in <a href=\"../nativity/text.shtml\"target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">On the Morning of Christ\'s Nativity</span></a>,which Shawcross notes \"cannot in its form be considered epical, though its substancecould be\" (Shawcross, 339). </p><p class=\"next\">Coming just two years after <span class=\"booktitle\">On the Morning ofChrist\'s Nativity</span> according to the 1631 dating, \"At a Vacation Exercise\"deviates radically from Latin poetic heritage to claim Milton\'s place for epiccanonization. Milton\'s intention that the poem prophesize his poetic destiny isexemplified by its isolation as a singular work in Milton\'s second collection ofpublished work, the 1673 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span>. Within the collection,\"At a Vacation Exercise\" is seemingly liberated from the Latin speaking exercisebonds of its origin: the 1673 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span> places Milton\'sEnglish work before its Latin counterparts without apology. At this point in Milton\'scareer, \"The poet of Paradise Lost needs and wants no introduction,\" Lewalski wrylynotes (505). Moreover, the collection foregrounds Milton\'s juvenile work, most ofwhich, like \"At a Vacation Exercise,\" originated as a school exercise. Anthologizingthese early exercises in craft, the 1673 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span> appearto proclaim the emancipation of these works from their original context, and to allowthem reflection as individual pieces deserving of further consideration.</p><p class=\"next\">Within the 1673 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span>, \"At a VacationExercise\" is placed between an English translation of <ahref=\"../fifth_ode/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">Book 1 of the Fifth Ode of Horace</a>and <a href=\"../conscience/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"On the New Forcers ofConscience under the Long Parliament (1646)\"</a>&mdash;both new in 1673. However, thetext\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Errata</span> notes that the \"Vacation Exercise\" wasmisplaced and \"should have come in\" between <a href=\"../fair_infant/text.shtml\"target=\"main\">\"On the Death of a Fair Infant dying of a Cough\"</a> and <ahref=\"../the_passion/index.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"The Passion.\"</a> So organized, the1673 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span> bolster Milton\'s projections of his futureas England\'s \"bardic Poet-Priest\" within \"At a Vacation Exercise.\" The precedingpoem, \"On the Death of a Fair Infant\"&mdash;also first published in 1673 and probablywritten in 1627-1628 (Campbell and Corns 27)&mdash;represents Milton\'s first attempt at aclassical Pindaric ode in English, according to <ahref=\"../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#revard_tangles\" target=\"main\">Stella Revard</a>.\"The Passion,\" which would have followed \"At a Vacation Exercise,\" actualizesauthorial identity from an unfinished work. Accompanied by a note expressing Milton\'sfrustration over his inability to conclude his assignment&mdash;\"This Subject the Authorfinding to be above the yeers he had, when he wrote it, and nothing satisfi\'d withwhat was begun, left it unfinisht\"&mdash;the poem is far from a gesture of humility.Indeed, \"The Passion\" materializes the author so thoroughly that it transforms thepoem into a meditation on Milton\'s writing process, \"a poem about Milton trying towork up the proper emotions to write a Passion poem\" (Revard 38). Placing \"At aVacation Exercise\" between poems that fashion Milton\'s identity as a fundamentallyEnglish poet, the 1673 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span>\' original formationweaves the poem into a narrative of a national poet coming into his full powers. </p><p class=\"next\">Like <span class=\"booktitle\">Elegy VI</span> strategically burstswith epic intent inside a non-epic genre, \"At a Vacation Exercise\" further expandsupon the initial prophecy of the verse epistle by addressing a larger audience.Milton\'s sudden eruption into \"At a Vacation Exercise\"&mdash;which proclaims he has \"somenaked thoughts that rove about / And loudly knock to have their passage out\" (<ahref=\"../vacation/text.shtml#line20\" target=\"text\">23-24</a>)&mdash;uses the prolusion\'sopportunity to address a large group of collegiate peers. One only wonders whatMilton\'s peers must have made of his bold entry into English beginning with theapostrophe \"Hail Native language\" after having listened to lewd farting and sex jokesfrom the \"Prolusio.\" Milton\'s syntax produces this departure in English as a briefmoment of frank communication between author and listener. After representing theEnglish language as a wardrobe in an extended metaphor in the first stanza, Miltonstrips his language of poetic devices in the middle of the poem and admits, \"Yet hadI rather, if I were to chuse, / Thy service in some graver subject use\" (<ahref=\"../vacation/text.shtml#line25\" target=\"text\">28-30</a>). England\'s nativetongue, the poet suggests, is full of sartorial treasures or \"richest Robes\" that canbe employed to greater ends perhaps even than in Latin (<ahref=\"../vacation/text.shtml#line20\" target=\"text\">21</a>). Milton turns the\"salting\" exercise on itself, using the opportunity it allows him to address hisacaemic audience to mock the scholastic tradition: instead of making a \"graversubject\" of their own language, English schoolboys insult each other in Latin.However much the preceding Prolusion may have amused its Cambridge audience, \"At aVacation Exercise\" reveals the rhetorical wealth and potential of the Englishlanguage, as much as it does Milton himself. </p><p class=\"next\">\"At a Vacation Exercise\" prepares England, then, for Milton\'s later,grand announcement of his resolution to be his country\'s epic poet in <ahref=\"../reason/book_1/text.shtml\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Reason ofChurch Government Urg\'d against Prelaty</span></a>. Presumed to have been written in1641&mdash;though its allusion to imprisonment of bishops may situate its composition in1642, the year it was published (Campbell and Corns, 146)&mdash;<spanclass=\"booktitle\">Reason of Church Government</span> would have been available formass purchase and its syntax accordingly is \"aimed at the general reader, not theexpert\" (<a href=\"../bibliography/a-b/text.shtml#douglas_bush\" target=\"main\">Douglas Bush</a>, 739). Milton used the opportunity to include a \"personal digression\"in the Preface to Book II that projects his destiny to craft epics \"adorning mynative tongue\" for the common Englishman he addresses.</p><p class=\"next\">Ultimately, <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> can be seento conclude Milton\'s narrative of self-presentation and realize the yearning forpoetic purpose proposed by \"At a Vacation Exercise.\" In \"At a Vacation Exercise,\"Donald Friedman sees a promise fulfilled in Book 1 of <spanclass=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span>. Friedman writes, </p><blockquote>In one sense, then, the beginning of Paradise Lost announces the end of avery long phase of Milton\'s education.&hellip; As always in Milton, the end of wisdomis action; the ultimate and only fitting result of the long maturation, thevictory over \'the perpetuall stumble and conjecture and disturbance in thisoure dark voyage,\' is something done, in the service \'intirely reasonable\'enjoined upon the poet by God and by his own awareness of his singular skillsand observations.<br />(<a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#donald_friedman\"target=\"main\">\"Harmony and the Poet\'s Voice in Some of Milton\'s Early Poems\"524</a>)</blockquote><p class=\"first\">In \"At a Vacation Exercise,\" Milton seeks a topic worthy of the\"action\" he deems a suitable dénouement to his canonization. Remarkably, byinscribing his desire to \"at Heav\'ns dore / Look in, and see each blissful Deitie\"(<a href=\"../vacation/text.shtml#line30\" target=\"text\">34-35</a>) and to \"sing ofsecret things that came to pass/ When Beldam Nature in her cradle was\" (<ahref=\"../vacation/text.shtml#line45\" target=\"text\">45-46</a>), \"At a VacationExercise\" acts as a belated preface to the poetic explorations of the 1667 <spanclass=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span>.</p><p class=\"next\">\"At a Vacation Exercise\" depicts Milton\'s early awareness of hisskills and calling, and, as a result, proposes a challenge he will rise to meet. \"Ata Vacation Exercise\" therefore consciously instills narrative within the history ofMilton\'s development as a poet, and ultimately defines its conclusion in <spanclass=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> as \"the end of wisdom\" (Friedman, 524). </p><p class=\"author\">Katie Kilkenny and Thomas Luxon </span>",
