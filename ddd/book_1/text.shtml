<p><span class="msummary">That Man is the occasion of his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> miseries, in most of those <span class="varspell" title="evils">evills</span> which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> imputes to <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> inflicting.  The absurdity of our canonists in their decrees about divorce.  The Christian <span class="varspell" title="imperial">imperiall</span> <span class="varspell" title="Laws">Lawes</span> <span class="varspell" title="framed">fram'd</span> with more Equity.  The opinion of <a href="" id="Hugo" class="annotBtn"><span class="reversem">Hugo Grotius</span></a>, and <a href="" id="PaulusFagius" class="annotBtn"><span class="reversem">Paulus Fagius</span></a>: And the <a href="" id="purpose" class="annotBtn">purpose</a> in <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> of this Discourse.</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="mod"><span class="minitial">M</span>any</span> men, whether it be their fate, or <a href="" id="fond" class="annotBtn">fond</a> opinion, easily <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> themselves, if God would but be <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> a while to withdraw his just punishments from us, and to <span class="varspell" title="restrain">restraine</span> what power either the <span class="varspell" title="devil">devill</span>, or any earthly enemy hath to <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> us woe, that then <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> nature would find immediate rest and releasement from all evils.  But verily they who think so, if they be such as have a <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> large enough to take into their thoughts a <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> survey of human things, would soon prove themselves in that opinion <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> <span class="varspell" title="deceived">deceiv'd</span>.  For though it were granted us by divine indulgence to be exempt from all that can be <span class="varspell" title="harmful">harmfull</span> to us from without, yet the <span class="varspell" title="perverseness">perversnesse</span> of our folly is so bent, that we should never <a href="" id="lin" class="annotBtn">lin</a> hammering out of our <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> hearts, as it were out of a flint, the seeds and sparkles of new misery to our selves, till all were in a blaze <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span>.  And no <span class="varspell" title="marvel">marvell</span> if out of our own hearts, for they are <a href="" id="evil" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span></a> but <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> out of those things which God meant us, either for a <span class="varspell" title="principal">principall</span> good, or a pure contentment, we are still hatching and contriving upon our selves matter of <span class="varspell" title="continual">continuall</span> sorrow and <span class="varspell" title="perplexity">perplexitie</span>.  What greater good to man then that revealed rule, whereby God vouchsafes to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us how he would be <span class="varspell" title="worshipped">worshipt</span>?  And yet that not rightly understood, became the cause that once a famous man in <span class="mi">Israel</span> could not but oblige his conscience to be the sacrificer, or if not, the <span class="varspell" title="jailer">jaylor</span> of his innocent and only <a href="" id="daughter" class="annotBtn">daughter</a>.  And was the cause oft-times that Armies of valiant men have given up their throats to a heathenish enemy on the <a href="" id="sabbathday" class="annotBtn">Sabbath day</a>: fondly thinking their defensive resistance to be as then a work <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span>.  What thing more instituted to the solace and delight of man <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> marriage, and yet the mis-interpreting of some Scripture directed mainly against the abusers of the Law for divorce <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> by <a href="" id="Moses" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Moses</span></a>, hath <span class="varspell" title="changed">chang'd</span> the blessing of matrimony not <span class="varspell" title="seldom">seldome</span> into a familiar and co-inhabiting <span class="varspell" title="mischief">mischiefe</span>; at least into a drooping and disconsolate <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> captivity, without refuge or redemption.  So <span class="varspell" title="ungoverned">ungovern'd</span> and so wild a race doth superstition run us from one extreme of abused liberty into the other of <span class="varspell" title="unmerciful">unmercifull</span> restraint.  For although God in the first <a name="conversation">ordaining</a> of <a href="" id="Genesis" class="annotBtn">marriage</a>, taught us to what end he did it, in words <span class="varspell" title="expressly">expresly</span> implying the apt and <span class="varspell" title="cheerful">cheerfull</span> <a href="" id="conversation" class="annotBtn">conversation</a> of man with woman, to comfort and refresh him against the evil of solitary life, not mentioning the purpose of generation till afterwards, as being but a secondary end in dignity, though <a href="" id="necessity" class="annotBtn">not in necessity;</a> yet now, if any two be but once handed in the Church, and have tasted in any sort the <span class="varspell" title="nuptial">nuptiall</span> bed, let them <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> themselves never so <span class="varspell" title="mistaken">mistak'n</span> in their dispositions through any error, concealment, or misadventure, that through their different tempers, thoughts, and constitutions, they can neither be to one another a remedy against <span class="varspell" title="loneliness">lonelines</span>, nor live in any union or contentment all their <span class="varspell" title="days">dayes</span>, yet they shall, so they be but found suitably <a href="" id="weapon" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="weaponed">weapon'd</span></a> to the least possibility of <span class="varspell" title="sensual">sensuall</span> enjoyment, be made, <span class="varspell" title="spite">spight</span> of <a href="" id="antipathy" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">antipathy</span></a> to <a href="" id="fadge" class="annotBtn">fadge</a> together, and combine as they may to their unspeakable <span class="varspell" title="wearisomeness">wearisomnes</span> and <span class="varspell" title="despair">despaire</span> of all sociable delight in the ordinance which God <span class="varspell" title="established">establisht</span> to that very end.  What a calamity is this, and as the Wise-man, if he were alive, would sigh out in his own phrase, what a <a href="" id="Sunne" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">sore <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> is this under the <span class="varspell" title="Sun">Sunne</span></span></a>!  All which we can <span class="varspell" title="refer">referre</span> justly to no other author <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <a href="" id="Canon" class="annotBtn">Canon Law</a> and her adherents, not consulting with <span class="varspell" title="charity">charitie</span>, the interpreter and guide of our faith, but resting in the <span class="varspell" title="mere">meere</span> element of the Text; <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtles</span> by the policy of the <span class="varspell" title="devil">devill</span> to make that gracious ordinance become unsupportable, that what with men not daring to venture upon wedlock, and what with men wearied out of it, all inordinate licence might abound.  It was for many ages that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> lay in disgrace with most of the ancient Doctors, as a work of the flesh, almost a defilement, wholly <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> to Priests, and the second time <span class="varspell" title="dissuaded">disswaded</span> to all, as he that reads <a href="" id="Jerom" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Tertullian</span> or <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jerome">Ierom</span></span></a> may see at large.  Afterwards it was thought so <a href="" id="dissolve" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Sacramental">Sacramentall</span></a>, that no adultery or desertion could dissolve it; and this is the sense of our Canon Courts in <span class="mi">England</span> to this day, but in no <a href="" id="els" class="annotBtn">other reformed Church <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span></a>: yet there remains in them also a burden on it as <span class="varspell" title="heavy">heavie</span> as the other two were <span class="varspell" title="disgraceful">disgracefull</span> or superstitious, and of as much iniquity, crossing a Law not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> by <span class="mi">Moses</span>, but <span class="varspell" title="charactered">character'd</span> in us by <a name="naturallaw">nature</a>, of more antiquity and deeper ground <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> marriage it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>; which Law is to force nothing against the <span class="varspell" title="faultless">faultles</span> proprieties of nature: yet that this may be <span class="varspell" title="colorably">colourably</span> done, our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> words touching divorce, are as it were <span class="varspell" title="congealed">congeal'd</span> into a stony rigor, inconsistent both with his doctrine and his office; and that which he <span class="varspell" title="preached">preacht</span> <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> to the conscience, is by <span class="varspell" title="Canonical">Canonicall</span> tyranny <span class="varspell" title="snatched">snatcht</span> into the compulsive censure of a <span class="varspell" title="judicial">judiciall</span> Court; where Laws are <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> even against the venerable and secret power of <span class="varspell" title="nature's">natures</span> impression, to love what ever cause be found to loath.  Which is a <span class="varspell" title="heinous">hainous</span> <span class="varspell" title="barbarism">barbarisme</span> both against the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, the dignity of man and his <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span>, the <span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnes</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Christianity">Christianitie</span>, and all the <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> respects of <span class="varspell" title="civility">civilitie</span>.  Notwithstanding that some the wisest and gravest among the <a href="" id="ChristianEmperours" class="annotBtn">Christian <span class="varspell" title="Emperors">Emperours</span></a>, who had about them, to consult with, those of the Fathers then living, who for their learning and <span class="varspell" title="holiness">holines</span> of life are still with us in great <span class="varspell" title="renown">renowne</span>, have made their statutes and edicts concerning this debate, far more <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> and relenting in many necessary cases, <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> the Canon is inflexible.  And <a href="" id="Hugo" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Hugo Grotius</span></a>, a man of these times, one of the best learned, seems not obscurely to adhere in his <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> to the equity of those <span class="varspell" title="Imperial">Imperiall</span> decrees, in his <a href="" id="notes" class="annotBtn">notes upon the <span class="mi">Evangelists</span></a>, much allaying the outward <span class="varspell" title="roughness">roughnesse</span> of the Text, which hath for the most part been too immoderately expounded; and excites the diligence of others to enquire further into this question, as containing many points that have not yet been <span class="varspell" title="explained">explain'd</span>.  Which ever likely to remain intricate and <span class="varspell" title="hopeless">hopelesse</span> upon the suppositions commonly stuck to, the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of <a href="" id="PaulusFagius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Paulus Fagius</span></a>, one so learned and so eminent in <span class="mi">England</span> once, if it might <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span>, would <span class="varspell" title="straight">strait</span> acquaint us with a solution of these differences, no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> prudent <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> compendious.  He in his comment on the <span class="mi">Pentateuch</span> doubted not to maintain that divorces might be as lawfully permitted by the Magistrate to Christians, as they were to the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span>.  But because he is but <span class="varspell" title="brief">briefe</span>, and these things of great consequence not to be kept obscure, I shall <span class="varspell" title="conceive">conceave</span> it nothing above my duty either for the difficulty or the censure that may <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> thereon, to communicate such thoughts as I also have had, and do offer them now in this <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> of reformation, to the candid view both of Church and Magistrate; especially because I see it the hope of good men, that those irregular and <span class="varspell" title="unspiritual">unspirituall</span> Courts have spun their utmost date in this Land; and some <span class="varspell" title="better">beter</span> course must now be <a href="" id="constituted" class="annotBtn">constituted</a>.  This <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> shall be the task and <a href="" id="period" class="annotBtn">period</a> of this discourse to prove, first that other reasons of divorce besides adultery, were by the Law of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, and are yet to be <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> by the Christian Magistrate as a <span class="varspell" title="piece">peece</span> of justice, and that the words of Christ are not hereby contraried.  Next, that to prohibit absolutely any divorce whatsoever except those which <span class="mi">Moses</span> excepted, is against the reason of Law, as in due place I shall <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> out of <span class="mi">Fagius</span> with many additions.  He therefore who by adventuring shall be so happy as with <span class="varspell" title="success">successe</span> to light the way of such an expedient liberty and truth as this, shall restore the much <span class="varspell" title="wronged">wrong'd</span> and over-<span class="varspell" title="sorrowed">sorrow'd</span> state of matrimony, not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> to those <span class="varspell" title="merciful">mercifull</span> and life-giving remedies of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, but, as much as may be, to that serene and <span class="varspell" title="blissful">blisfull</span> condition it was in <a href="" id="beginning" class="annotBtn">at the beginning</a>; and shall <span class="varspell" title="deserve">deserv</span> of all <span class="varspell" title="apprehensive">aprehensive</span> men (considering the troubles and distempers which for want of this insight have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> so oft in <span class="varspell" title="Kingdoms">Kingdomes</span>, in States and Families) shall deserve to be <span class="varspell" title="reckoned">reck'n'd</span> among the <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> benefactors of <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> and <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> life; above the inventors of wine and <span class="varspell" title="oil">oyle</span>; for this is a far dearer, far nobler, and more desirable cherishing to <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> life, unworthily <span class="varspell" title="exposed">expos'd</span> to <span class="varspell" title="sadness">sadnes</span> and mistake, which he shall vindicate.  Not that licence and levity and unconsented breach of faith should herein be <span class="varspell" title="countenanced">countnanc't</span>, but that some conscionable, and tender <span class="varspell" title="pity">pitty</span> might be had of those who have unwarily in a thing they never <span class="varspell" title="practiced">practiz'd</span> before, made themselves the bondmen of a <span class="varspell" title="luckless">luckles</span> and <span class="varspell" title="helpless">helples</span> matrimony.  In which Argument he whose courage can serve him to give the first onset, must look for two <span class="varspell" title="several">severall</span> oppositions: the one from those who having sworn themselves to long <a name="custom">custom</a> and the letter of the Text, will not out of the road: the other from those whose <span class="varspell" title="gross">grosse</span> and vulgar apprehensions conceit but low of <span class="varspell" title="matrimonial">matrimoniall</span> purposes, and in the work of male and female think they have all.  <span class="varspell" title="Nevertheless">Neverthelesse</span>, it shall be here sought by due <span class="varspell" title="ways">wayes</span> to be made <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span>, that those words of God in the institution, promising a meet help against <a href="" id="lonelines" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="loneliness">lonelines</span></a>, and those Words of Christ, <a href="" id="yoke" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">That his yoke is <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span>, and his burden light</span></a>, were not spoken in vain; for if the knot of marriage may in no case be <span class="varspell" title="dissolved">dissolv'd</span> but for adultery, all the <span class="varspell" title="burdens">burd'ns</span> and services of the <a href="" id="Law" class="annotBtn">Law</a> are not so intolerable.  This <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> is <span class="varspell" title="desired">desir'd</span> of them who are minded to judge hardly of thus maintaining, that they would be still, and <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> all out, nor think it <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> to answer deliberate reason with sudden heat and noise; <span class="varspell" title="remembering">remembring</span> this, that many truths now of reverend esteem and credit, had their birth and beginning once from singular and private thoughts; while the most of men were otherwise <span class="varspell" title="possessed">possest</span>; and had the fate at first to be generally exploded and <span class="varspell" title="exclaimed">exclaim'd</span> on by many violent opposers: yet I may <span class="varspell" title="err">erre</span> perhaps in soothing my <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> that this present truth <span class="varspell" title="revived">reviv'd</span>, will deserve on all hands to be not sinisterly <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span>, in that it undertakes the cure of an <a href="" id="iuveterate" class="annotBtn">inveterate</a> disease crept into the best part of <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> <span class="varspell" title="society">societie</span>: and to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> this with no smarting corrosive, but with a smooth and pleasing lesson, which <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> hath the <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> to soften and <span class="varspell" title="dispel">dispell</span> rooted and knotty <span class="varspell" title="sorrows">sorrowes</span>; and without <span class="varspell" title="enchantment">inchantment</span> if that be <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, or <a href="" id="spel" class="annotBtn">spell</a> <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, hath regard at once both to serious <span class="varspell" title="pity">pitty</span> and upright honesty; that tends to the redeeming and restoring of none but such as are the object of compassion; having in an ill <span class="varspell" title="hour">houre</span> <span class="varspell" title="hampered">hamper'd</span> themselves to the utter dispatch of all their most beloved comforts and repose for this <span class="varspell" title="life's">lives</span> term.  But if we shall obstinately dislike this new overture of unexpected ease and recovery, what remains but to deplore the <span class="varspell" title="frowardness">frowardnes</span> of our <span class="varspell" title="hopeless">hopeles</span> condition, which neither can endure the estate we are in, nor admit of remedy either sharp or sweet.  Sharp we our selves <span class="varspell" title="distaste">distast</span>; and sweet, under whose hands we are, is <span class="varspell" title="scrupled">scrupl'd</span> and suspected as too <span class="varspell" title="luscious">lushious</span>.  In such a posture Christ found the <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jews">Iews</span></span>, who were neither won with the austerity of <span class="mi">John the Baptist</span>, and thought it too much licence to follow freely the charming pipe of him who sounded and <span class="varspell" title="proclaimed">proclaim'd</span> liberty and relief to all distresses: yet Truth in some age or other will find her <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnes</span>, and shall be <span class="varspell" title="justified">justify'd</span> at last by her own <a href="" id="children" class="annotBtn">children</a>.</p>

<span class="msummary">The Position. <span class="varspell" title="Proved">Prov'd</span> by the Law of Moses.  That Law expounded and asserted to a <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> and charitable use, first by <span class="reversem">Paulus Fagius</span>; next with other additions.</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="To"><span class="minitial">T</span>o</span> remove <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> if it be possible, this great and sad oppression which through the <span class="varspell" title="strictness">strictnes</span> of a <span class="varspell" title="literal">literall</span> interpreting hath invaded and <span class="varspell" title="disturbed">disturb'd</span> the dearest and most peaceable estate of <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> society, to the over-burdening, if not the over-whelming of many Christians better worth <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to be so deserted of the <span class="varspell" title="Church's">Churches</span> considerate care, this position shall be laid down; first proving, then answering what may be objected either from Scripture or light of reason.
</p>


<p>
<span class="mi">That indisposition, <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span>, or contrariety of mind, arising from a cause in nature unchangeable, <span class="varspell" title="hindering">hindring</span>, and ever likely to hinder the main benefits of <span class="varspell" title="conjugal">conjugall</span> society, which are solace and peace, is a greater reason of divorce <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> frigidity, especially if there be no children, and that there be <span class="varspell" title="mutual">mutuall</span> consent.</span>
</p>
<p>
This I gather from the Law in <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 24.1.  <span class="mi">When a man hath <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> a wife and married her, and it come to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> that she find no <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> in his eyes, because he hath found some <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleanesse</span> in her, let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c</abbr>.</span>  This Law, if the words of Christ may be admitted into our <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span>, shall never while the world stands, for him be abrogated.  First <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> I here set down <a href="" id="learned" class="annotBtn">what learned <span class="mi">Fagius</span> hath <span class="varspell" title="observed">observ'd</span></a> on this Law; <span class="mi">The Law of God</span>, saith he, <span class="mi">permitted divorce for the help of human <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknes</span>.  For every one that of necessity <span class="varspell" title="separates">separats</span>, cannot live single.  That Christ <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> divorce to his own, hinders not; for what is that to the unregenerate, who hath not <span class="varspell" title="attained">attain'd</span> such perfection?  Let not the remedy be <span class="varspell" title="despised">despis'd</span> which was <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> to <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknes</span>.  And when Christ saith, who marries the <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span>, commits adultery, it is to be understood if he had any plot in the divorce</span>.  The rest I reserve <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> it be disputed, how the Magistrate is to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> herein.  From hence we may plainly discern a twofold consideration in this Law. First the End of the Lawgiver, and the proper act of the Law to command or to allow <span class="varspell" title="something">somthing</span> just and honest, or indifferent.  Secondly, his sufferance from some accidental result of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> by this allowance, which the Law cannot remedy.  For if this Law have no other end or act but <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> the allowance of a sin, though never to so good intention, that Law is no Law but sin <span class="varspell" title="muffled">muffl'd</span> in the robe of Law, or Law <span class="varspell" title="disguised">disguis'd</span> in the loose garment of sin.  Both which are too <span class="varspell" title="foul">foule</span> <span class="mi">Hypotheses</span> to save the <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Phenomenon">Ph&aelig;nomenon</span></span> of our <span class="varspell" title="Savior's">Saviours</span> answer to the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> about this matter.  And I trust anon by the help of an infallible guide to <span class="varspell" title="perfect">perfet</span> such <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Prutenic">Prutenick</span></span> tables as shall mend the <a href="" id="astronomy" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Astronomy</span></a> of our wide expositors.
</p>
<p>
The cause of divorce <span class="varspell" title="mentioned">mention'd</span> in the Law is translated <span class="mi">some <span class="varspell" title="uncleannness">uncleannesse</span></span>, but in the Hebrew it sounds <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="nakedness">nakednes</span> of ought, or any real <span class="varspell" title="nakedness">nakednes</span>;</span> which by all the <a href="" id="interpreters" class="annotBtn">learned interpreters</a> is <span class="varspell" title="referred">refer'd</span> to the mind, as well as to the body.  And what greater <span class="varspell" title="nakedness">nakednes</span> or <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> of mind <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that which hinders ever the solace and <span class="varspell" title="peaceful">peacefull</span> society of the <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> couple, and what hinders that more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> and <span class="varspell" title="defectiveness">defectivenes</span> of an unconjugal mind.  The cause <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> of divorce <span class="varspell" title="expressed">expres't</span> in the position cannot but agree with that <span class="varspell" title="described">describ'd</span> in the best and equalest sense of <span class="mi">Moses</span> Law.  Which being a matter of pure charity, is plainly moral, and more now in force <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ever: <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> surely <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>.  For if under the Law such was <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> gracious indulgence, as not to suffer the ordinance of his <span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnes</span> and <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span>, through any error to be <span class="varspell" title="seared">ser'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="stigmatized">stigmatiz'd</span> upon his servants to their misery and <span class="varspell" title="thralldom">thraldome</span>, much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> will he suffer it now under the covenant of grace, by abrogating his former grant of remedy and <span class="varspell" title="relief">releef</span>.  But the first institution will be objected to have <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> inseparable.  To that a little patience <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> this first part have amply <span class="varspell" title="discoursed">discours't</span> the grave and pious reasons of this divorsive Law; and then I doubt not but with one gentle stroking to wipe away ten thousand <span class="varspell" title="tears">teares</span> out of the life of man.  Yet thus much I shall now insist on, that what ever the institution were, it could not be so <a href="" id="enormous" class="annotBtn">enormous</a>, nor so rebellious against both nature and reason as to exalt it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> above the end and person for whom it was instituted.</p>

<span class="msummary">The first reason of this Law grounded on the prime reason of matrimony.

To this, <a href="" id="fournames" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Fagius, Calvin, Pareus, Rivetus</span></a>, as willingly and largely assent as can be <span class="varspell" title="wished">wisht</span>.  And indeed it is a greater blessing from God, more worthy so excellent a creature as man is, and a higher end to <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> and <span class="varspell" title="sanctify">sanctifie</span> the league of marriage, whenas the solace and satisfaction of the <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> is regarded and provided for before the sensitive pleasing of the body.  And with all generous persons <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> thus it is, that where the <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> and person pleases aptly, there some unaccomplishment of the <span class="varspell" title="body's">bodies</span> delight may be better born with, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> when the <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> hangs off in an unclosing disproportion, though the body be as it ought; for there all <span class="varspell" title="corporal">corporall</span> delight will soon become <span class="varspell" title="unsavory">unsavoury</span> and contemptible.  And the <span class="varspell" title="solitariness">solitarines</span> of man, which God had namely and principally <span class="varspell" title="ordered">orderd</span> to prevent by <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, hath no remedy, but lies under a worse condition <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the loneliest single life; for in single life the absence and <span class="varspell" title="remoteness">remotenes</span> of a helper might inure him to expect his own comforts out of <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, or to seek with hope; but here the <span class="varspell" title="continual">continuall</span> sight of his deluded thoughts without cure, must needs be to him, if especially his <a href="" id="complexion" class="annotBtn">complexion</a> incline him to melancholy, a daily trouble and <span class="varspell" title="pain">paine</span> of <span class="varspell" title="loss">losse</span> in <span class="varspell" title="some">som</span> degree like that which <span class="varspell" title="Reprobates">Reprobats</span> feel.

<span class="msummary">The ignorance and iniquity of Canon law, providing for the right of the body in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, but nothing for the wrongs and <span class="varspell" title="grievances">greevances</span> of the mind.  An objection, that the mind should be better <span class="varspell" title="looked">lookt</span> to before contract, answered.</span> 
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="How"><span class="minitial">H</span>ow</span> vain <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> is it, and how preposterous in the Canon Law, to have made such <span class="varspell" title="careful">carefull</span> provision against the impediment of <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> <a href="" id="performance" class="annotBtn">performance,</a> and to have had no care about the unconversing inability of mind, so defective to the purest and most sacred end of matrimony: and that the <span class="varspell" title="vessel">vessell</span> of voluptuous enjoyment must be made good to him that has <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> it upon trust without any caution, when as the mind from whence must flow the acts of peace and love, a far more <span class="varspell" title="precious">pretious</span> mixture <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <a name="quintessence">quintessence</a> of an <a href="" id="excrement" class="annotBtn">excrement</a>, though it be found never so deficient and unable to <span class="varspell" title="perform">performe</span> the best duty of marriage in a <span class="varspell" title="cheerful">cheerfull</span> and agreeable conversation, shall be thought good <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, how ever flat and melancholious it be, and must serve though to the <span class="varspell" title="eternal">eternall</span> disturbance and languishing of him that complains him.  Yet <a name="rational">wisdom</a> and charity <span class="varspell" title="weighing">waighing</span> <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> own institution, would think that the pining of a sad spirit wedded to <span class="varspell" title="loneliness">lonelines</span> should deserve to be <span class="varspell" title="freed">free'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="as well">aswell</span> as the impatience of a <span class="varspell" title="sensual">sensuall</span> desire so providently <span class="varspell" title="relieved">reliev'd</span>.  Tis read to us in the Liturgy, that <span class="mi">we must not marry to <span class="varspell" title="satisfy">satisfie</span> the fleshly appetite, like brute beasts that have no understanding</span>; but the Canon so runs, as if it <span class="varspell" title="dreamed">dreamt</span> of no other matter <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> such an appetite to be <span class="varspell" title="satisfied">satisfy'd</span>; for if it happen that nature hath <span class="varspell" title="stopped">stopt</span> or <span class="varspell" title="extinguished">extinguisht</span> the veins of sensuality, that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is <span class="varspell" title="annulled">annull'd</span>.  But though all the faculties of the understanding and conversing part after <span class="varspell" title="trial">triall</span> <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> to be so ill and so <span class="varspell" title="adversely">aversly</span> met through <span class="varspell" title="nature's">natures</span> unalterable working, as that neither peace, nor any sociable contentment can follow, tis as nothing, the contract shall stand as <span class="varspell" title="firm">firme</span> as ever, betide what will.  What is this but secretly to instruct us, that however many grave reasons are pretended to the <span class="varspell" title="married">maried</span> life, yet that nothing indeed is thought worth regard therein, but the <span class="varspell" title="prescribed">prescrib'd</span> satisfaction of an <span class="varspell" title="irrational">irrationall</span> heat;  which cannot be but ignominious to the state of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, <span class="varspell" title="dishonorable">dishonourable</span> to the <span class="varspell" title="undervalued">undervalu'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> of man, and even to Christian doctrine it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span>. While it seems more <span class="varspell" title="moved">mov'd</span> at the disappointing of an impetuous nerve, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> at the ingenuous grievance of a <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> unreasonably <span class="varspell" title="yoked">yoakt</span>; and to place more of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="channel">channell</span> of concupiscence, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in the pure influence of peace and love, whereof the <span class="varspell" title="soul's">souls</span> <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> contentment is the <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> fountain.
</p>

<p>
But <a name="mistaken">some</a> are ready to object, that the disposition ought seriously to be <span class="varspell" title="considered">consider'd</span> before.  But let them know again, that for all the <span class="varspell" title="wariness">warinesse</span> can be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, it may yet befall a discreet man to be <span class="varspell" title="mistaken">mistak'n</span> in his choice: and we have plenty of <a href="" id="examples" class="annotBtn">examples</a>.  The <span class="varspell" title="soberest">sobrest</span> and best <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span> men are least <span class="varspell" title="practised">practiz'd</span> in these affairs; and who <span class="varspell" title="knows">knowes</span> not that the <span class="varspell" title="bashful">bashfull</span> <a name="muteness"><span class="varspell" title="muteness">mutenes</span></a> of a virgin may oft-times hide all the <span class="varspell" title="unliveliness">unlivelines</span> and <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> sloth which is really unfit for conversation; nor is there that freedom of <span class="varspell" title="access">accesse</span> granted or <span class="varspell" title="presumed">presum'd</span>, as may suffice to a perfect discerning till too late: and where any indisposition is suspected, what more <span class="varspell" title="usual">usuall</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> of friends, that acquaintance, as it increases, will amend all.  And lastly, it is not strange though many who have spent their youth <span class="varspell" title="chastely">chastly</span>, are in some things not so quick-sighted, while they <span class="varspell" title="haste">hast</span> too eagerly to light the <span class="varspell" title="nuptial">nuptiall</span> <a href="" id="torch" class="annotBtn">torch</a>; nor is it therefore that for a modest error a man should forfeit so great a <span class="varspell" title="happiness">happines</span>, and no charitable means to release him.  Since they who have <span class="varspell" title="lived">liv'd</span> most loosely by reason of their bold accustoming, prove most <span class="varspell" title="successful">successfull</span> in their matches, because their wild affections <span class="varspell" title="unsettling">unsetling</span> at will, have been as so many divorces to teach them experience.  When as the <a name="sober_man">sober</a> man <span class="varspell" title="honoring">honouring</span> the appearance of modesty, and hoping well of every <span class="varspell" title="social">sociall</span> <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> under that <span class="varspell" title="veil">veile</span>, may easily chance to meet, if not with a body impenetrable, yet often with a mind to all other due conversation inaccessible, and to all the more estimable and superior purposes of matrimony <span class="varspell" title="useless">uselesse</span> and almost <span class="varspell" title="lifeless">liveles</span>: and what a solace, what a fit help such a consort would be through the whole life of a man, is <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> pain to conjecture <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to have experience.

<span class="msummary">The Second Reason of this Law, because without it, <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> as it <span class="varspell" title="happens">happ'ns</span> oft is not a remedy of that which it promises, as any <span class="varspell" title="rational">rationall</span> creature would expect.

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="And"><span class="minitial">A</span>nd</span> that we may further see what a violent and <span class="varspell" title="cruel">cruell</span> thing it is to force the continuing of those together, whom God and nature in the gentlest end of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> never <span class="varspell" title="joined">joynd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="diverse">divers</span> evils and extremities that follow upon such a compulsion shall here be set in view.  Of evils the first and greatest is, that hereby a most absurd and rash imputation is <span class="varspell" title="fixed">fixt</span> upon God and his holy Laws, of conniving and dispensing with open and common adultery among his chosen people; a thing which the rankest politician would think it shame and <a href="" id="disworship" class="annotBtn">disworship</a>, that his Laws should countenance; how and in what manner this comes to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span>, I shall reserve, till the course of method brings on the unfolding of many Scriptures.

Then enters <span class="mi">Hate</span>, not that Hate that sins, but that which <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> is <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> dissatisfaction, and the turning aside from a mistaken object: if that mistake have done injury, it fails not to <span class="varspell" title="dismiss">dismisse</span> with <span class="varspell" title="recompense">recompence</span>; for to retain still, and not be able to love, is to heap up more injury.

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Thirdly"><span class="minitial">T</span>hirdly</span>, Yet it is next to be <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, if he must be still bound without reason by a <span class="varspell" title="deaf">deafe</span> rigor, that when he perceives the just expectance of his mind defeated, he will begin even against Law to cast about where he may find his satisfaction more <span class="varspell" title="complete">compleat</span>, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> he be a thing heroically <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span>, and that are not the common lump of men for whom chiefly the Laws ought to be made, though not to their sins, yet to their unsinning weaknesses, it being above their strength to endure the lonely estate, which while they <span class="varspell" title="shunned">shun'd</span>, they are <span class="varspell" title="fallen">fal'n</span> into.

<span class="varspell" title="Fourthly"><span class="minitial">F</span>ourthly</span>, <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> is a <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> the very <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> consists, not in a <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> cohabitation, and <span class="varspell" title="counterfeit">counterfet</span> performance of duties, but in <span class="varspell" title="unfeigned">unfained</span> love and peace.  And of <span class="varspell" title="matrimonial">matrimoniall</span> love no doubt but that was chiefly meant, which by the ancient Sages was thus <span class="varspell" title="parabled">parabl'd</span>, That Love, if he be not twin-born, yet hath a brother wondrous like him, <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> <a href="" id="anteros" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Anteros</span></a>: whom while he seeks all about, his chance is to meet with many <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> and <span class="varspell" title="feigning">faining</span> Desires that wander singly up and down in his <span class="varspell" title="likeness">likenes</span>.  By them in their <span class="varspell" title="borrowed">borrow'd</span> garb, Love, though not wholly blind, as Poets wrong <a href="" id="him" class="annotBtn">him</a>, yet having but one eye, as being born an Archer aiming, and that eye not the quickest in this dark region here below, which is not <span class="varspell" title="Love's">Loves</span> proper sphere, partly out of the simplicity, and credulity which is native to him, often <span class="varspell" title="deceived">deceiv'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="embraces">imbraces</span> and consorts him with these <a href="" id="obvious" class="annotBtn">obvious</a> and <a href="" id="suborned" class="annotBtn">suborned</a> striplings, as if they were his <span class="varspell" title="Mother's">Mothers</span> own Sons, for so he thinks them, while they <span class="varspell" title="subtly">suttly</span> keep themselves most on his blind side.  But after a while, as his manner is, when soaring up into the high <span class="varspell" title="Tower">Towr</span> of his <a href="" id="apogaeum" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Apogaeum">Apog&aelig;um</span></span></a>, above the shadow of the earth, he darts out the direct <span class="varspell" title="rays">rayes</span> of his then most piercing eyesight upon the impostures, and trim disguises that were <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> with him, and discerns that this is not his <span class="varspell" title="genuine">genuin</span> brother, as he <span class="varspell" title="imagined">imagin'd</span>,  he has no longer the power to hold fellowship with such a personated mate.  For <span class="varspell" title="straight">strait</span> his arrows <span class="varspell" title="lose">loose</span> their golden heads, and shed their purple feathers, his <span class="varspell" title="silken">silk'n</span> <a href="" id="breades" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="braids">breades</span></a> untwine, and slip their knots, and that original and <span class="varspell" title="fiery">firie</span> <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> him by Fate, all on a sudden goes out and leaves him <span class="varspell" title="undeified">undeifi'd</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="despoiled">despoil'd</span> of all his force: till finding <span class="mi">Anteros</span> at last, he kindles and repairs the almost faded ammunition of his Deity by the reflection of a coequal <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> <a href="" id="homogeneal" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">homogeneal</span></a> fire.  Thus <a href="" id="me" class="annotBtn">mine author</a> sung it to me; and by the leave of those who would be counted the only grave ones, this is no <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> amatorious novel (though to be wise and <span class="varspell" title="skillful">skilful</span> in these matters, men heretofore of greatest name in <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, have <span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteemd</span> it one of the highest <span class="varspell" title="arcs">arks</span> that human contemplation circling upward, can make from the <a href="" id="sea" class="annotBtn">glassy Sea</a> <span class="varspell" title="whereon">wheron</span> she stands) but this is a deep and serious verity, shewing us that Love in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> cannot live nor subsist <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> it be <a href="" id="mutual" class="annotBtn">mutual</a>; and where Love cannot be, there can be left of wedlock nothing, but the empty husk of an outside matrimony; as <span class="varspell" title="undelightful">undelightfull</span> and unpleasing to God, as any other kind of <span class="varspell" title="hypocrisy">hypocrisie</span>.  So <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> is his command from tying men to the observance of duties, which there is no help for, but they must be <span class="varspell" title="dissembled">dissembl'd</span>.

Surely the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span> had their saving peace about them, <span class="varspell" title="as well">aswell</span> as we, yet care was <span class="varspell" title="taken">tak'n</span> that this <span class="varspell" title="wholesome">wholsom</span> provision for <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> peace should also be <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> them; and must this be <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> to Christians?  O <span class="varspell" title="peverseness">perversnes</span>! that the Law should be made more provident of peacemaking <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the Gospel! that the Gospel should be put to beg a most necessary help of mercy from the Law but must not have it: and that to grind in the <a href="" id="mill" class="annotBtn">mill</a> of an undelighted and <span class="varspell" title="servile">servil</span> copulation, must be the only <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> work of a Christian <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, oft times with such a yokefellow, from whom both love and peace, both nature and Religion <a href="" id="mourns" class="annotBtn">mourns</a> to be separated.  I cannot <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> be so diffident, as not securely to conclude, that he who can receive nothing of the most important helps in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, being <span class="varspell" title="thereby">therby</span> <span class="varspell" title="disenabled">disinabl'd</span> to return that duty which is his, with a clear and hearty <span class="varspell" title="countenance">countnance</span>; and thus continues to grieve whom he would not, and is no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="grieved">griev'd</span>, that man ought even for <span class="varspell" title="love's">loves</span> sake and peace to move Divorce upon good and <span class="varspell" title="liberal">liberall</span> conditions to the <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span>.

And because some think the <span class="varspell" title="children">childr'n</span> of a second matrimony succeeding a divorce would not be a holy seed, it <span class="varspell" title="hindered">hinder'd</span> not the Jews from being so, and why should we not think them more holy <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the off-spring of a former ill-twisted wedlock, <span class="varspell" title="begotten">begott'n</span> only out of a <span class="varspell" title="bestial">bestiall</span> <span class="varspell" title="necessity">necessitie</span> without any true love or contentment, or joy to their parents,  so that in some sense we may call them the <a href="" id="wrath" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">children of wrath</span></a> and anguish, which will as little conduce to their sanctifying, as if they had been bastards; for nothing more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> disturbance of mind suspends us from approaching to God. Such a disturbance especially as both assaults our faith and trust in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> providence, and ends, if there be not a miracle of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> on either side, not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> in <span class="varspell" title="bitterness">bitternes</span> and wrath, the canker of devotion, but in a desperate and <span class="varspell" title="vicious">vitious</span> <span class="varspell" title="carelessness">carelesnes</span>; when he sees <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> without fault of his, <span class="varspell" title="trained">train'd</span> by a <span class="varspell" title="deceitful">deceitfull</span> bait into a snare of misery, <span class="varspell" title="betrayed">betrai'd</span> by an alluring ordinance, and then made the thrall of <span class="varspell" title="heaviness">heavines</span> and discomfort by an undivorcing Law of God, as he erroneously thinks, but of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> <span class="varspell" title="iniquity">iniquitie</span>, as the truth is; for that God <span class="varspell" title="prefers">preferres</span> the free and <span class="varspell" title="cheerful">cheerfull</span> Worship of a Christian, before the grievous and exacted observance of an unhappy marriage, besides that the <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> <span class="varspell" title="maxims">maximes</span> of Religion assure us, will be more manifest by drawing a parallel argument from the ground of divorcing an <span class="varspell" title="Idolatress">Idolatresse</span>, which was, lest he should alienate his heart from the true worship of God: and what difference is there whether she pervert him to superstition by her enticing sorcery, or <span class="varspell" title="disenable">disinable</span> him in the whole service of God through the disturbance of her <span class="varspell" title="unhelpful">unhelpfull</span> and unfit society, and so drive him at last through murmuring and despair to thoughts of <span class="varspell" title="Atheism">Atheisme</span>;  neither doth it lessen the cause of separating in that the one willingly allures him from the faith, the other perhaps unwillingly drives him; for in the account of God it comes all to one that the wife <span class="varspell" title="loses">looses</span> him a servant; and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> by all the united force of the <span class="mi">Decalogue</span> she ought to be <a href="" id="disbanded" class="annotBtn">disbanded</a>, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> we must set <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> above God and charity, which is the doctrine of devils, no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> forbidding to <a href="" id="timothy" class="annotBtn">marry</a>.</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="And"><span class="minitial">A</span>nd</span> here by the way to illustrate the whole question of divorce, ere this treatise end, I shall not be loath to spend a few lines in hope to give a full resolve of that which is yet so much controverted, whether an idolatrous <span class="varspell" title="heretic">heretick</span> ought be <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span>.  To the resolving <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> we must first know that the <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jews">Iews</span></span> were commanded to divorce an <span class="varspell" title="unbelieving">unbeleeving</span> Gentile for two causes: first, because all other Nations especially the <span class="mi">Canaanites</span>, were to them unclean.  Secondly, to avoid seducement.  That other Nations were to the <span class="mi">Jews</span> impure, even to the separating of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, will appear out of <span class="mi"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr></span> 34.16. <span class="mi"><span title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</span></span> <a href="" id="verses" class="annotBtn">7. 3, 6</a>. <span class="varspell" title="compared">compar'd</span> with <span class="mi">Ezra</span> 9. 2. also <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> 10. 10, 11.<span class="mi"> <abbr title="Nehemiah">Nehem.</abbr></span> 13. 30.  This was the ground of that doubt <span class="varspell" title="raised">rais'd</span> among the <span class="mi">Corinthians</span> by some of the <a href="" id="circumcision" class="annotBtn">Circumcision</a>, Whether an <span class="varspell" title="unbeliever">unbeleever</span> were not still to be counted an unclean thing, so as that they ought to divorce from such a person.  This doubt of theirs <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span> removes by an <span class="varspell" title="Evangelical">Evangelicall</span> reason, having respect to that vision of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Peter</span>, wherein the distinction of clean and unclean being <span class="varspell" title="abolished">abolisht</span>, all living creatures were sanctified to a pure and Christian use, and mankind especially, now invited by a general call to the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> of grace.  Therefore saith <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>, <span class="mi">The <a href="" id="unbeleeving" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="unbelieving">unbeleeving</span> wife</a> is <span class="varspell" title="sanctified">sanctify'd</span> by the husband</span>; that is, made pure and <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> to his use; so that he need not put her away for fear lest her unbelief should defile him; but that if he found her love <span class="varspell" title="still">stil</span> towards him, he might rather hope to win her.  The second reason of that divorce was to avoid seducement, as is <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> by comparing those places of the Law, to that which <span class="mi">Ezra</span> and <span class="mi">Nehemiah</span> did by divine warrant in compelling the <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jews">Iews</span></span> to <span class="varspell" title="forgo">forgoe</span> their wives.  And this reason is <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> and <span class="varspell" title="perpetual">perpetuall</span> in the rule of Christian faith without evasion. Therefore saith the Apostle 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthinas">Cor.</abbr></span> 6.  <span class="mi"><a href="" id="infidels" class="annotBtn">Mis-yoke</a> not together with infidels</span>, which is interpreted of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> in the first place.  And although the former <span class="varspell" title="legal">legall</span> pollution be now <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> off, yet there is a <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span> contagion in Idolatry as much to be <span class="varspell" title="shunned">shun'd</span>; and though seducement were not to be <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, yet where there is no hope of converting, there <span class="varspell" title="always">alwayes</span> ought to be a certain religious aversation and abhorring, which can no way sort with <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>: Therefore saith <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>, <span class="mi">What fellowship hath <span class="varspell" title="righteousness">righteousnesse</span> with <span class="varspell" title="unrighteousness">unrighteousnesse</span>? what communion hath light with <span class="varspell" title="darkness">darknes</span>? what concord hath Christ with Belial</span>? <span class="mi">what part hath he that <span class="varspell" title="believeth">beleeveth</span> with an infidel</span>?  And in the next verse but one he moralizes and makes us liable to that command of <span class="mi">Isaiah</span>; <span class="mi">Wherfore come out from among them, and be ye separate saith the Lord; touch not the <a href="" id="ye" class="annotBtn">unclean thing</a>, and I will receive ye.</span>  And this command thus <a href="" id="gospelized" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Gospelized">Gospelliz'd</span></a> to us, hath the same force with that <span class="varspell" title="whereon">wheron</span> <span class="mi">Ezra</span> grounded the pious necessity of divorcing.  Neither had he other commission for what he did, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> such a <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> command in <span class="mi"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr></span> as this, nay not so direct as this; for he is bid there not to <a href="" id="deut" class="annotBtn">marry</a>, but not bid to divorce, and yet we see with what a zeal and confidence he was the author of a <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> divorce between the <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> and <span class="varspell" title="unfaithful">unfaithfull</span> seed.  The <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> is more plainly on his side according to three of the Evangelists, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the words of the Law; for where the case of divorce is handled with such a severity as was fittest to aggravate the fault of unbounded licence; yet still in the same chapter when it comes into question afterwards whether any <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> respect, or natural relation which is dearest, may be our plea to divide, or hinder, or but delay our duty to religion, we <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> it <span class="varspell" title="determined">determin'd</span> that father and mother, and wife also is not only to be hated, but <span class="varspell" title="forsaken">forsak'n</span>, if we mean to inherit the great reward there <a href="" id="promise" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span></a>. Nor will it suffice to be put off by saying we must forsake them <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> by not consenting or not complying with them, for that were to be <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, and roundly too, though being of the same faith they should but seek, out of a fleshly <span class="varspell" title="tenderness">tendernes</span> to <span class="varspell" title="weaken">weak'n</span> our Christian fortitude with worldly <span class="varspell" title="persuasions">perswasions</span>, or but to unsettle our <span class="varspell" title="constancy">constancie</span> with timorous and <span class="varspell" title="softening">softning</span> suggestions: as we may read with what a vehemence <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Job">Iob</span></span> the patientest of men, rejected the <span class="varspell" title="desperate">desperat</span> counsels of his <a href="" id="job" class="annotBtn">wife</a>; and <span class="mi">Moses</span>, the meekest being <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span> offended with the prophane speeches of <a href="" id="zippora" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Zippora</span></a>, sent her back to her father.  But if they shall perpetually at our elbow seduce us from the true worship of God, or defile and daily scandalize our conscience by their <span class="varspell" title="hopeless">hopeles</span> continuance in misbelief, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> in the due <span class="varspell" title="progress">progresse</span> of reason, and that ever-<span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> proportion which justice proceeds by, it cannot be <span class="varspell" title="imagined">imagin'd</span> that this cited place, commands <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a <span class="varspell" title="total">totall</span> and <span class="varspell" title="final">finall</span> separation from such an adherent; at least that no force should be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> to keep them together: while we remember that God commanded <span class="mi">Abraham</span> to send away his irreligious wife and her son for the offences which they gave in a pious family.  And it may be <span class="varspell" title="guessed">guest</span> that <span class="mi">David</span> for the like cause <span class="varspell" title="disposed">dispos'd</span> of <span class="mi">Michal</span> in such a sort, as little <span class="varspell" title="differed">differ'd</span> from a dismission.  Therefore against reiterated scandals and seducements which  never cease, much more can no other remedy or retirement be found but absolute departure.  For what kind of matrimony can that remain to be, what one <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> between such can be <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</span> as it should be from the heart, when their thoughts and spirits <span class="varspell" title="fly">flie</span> asunder as <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> as heaven from hell; especially if the time that hope should send forth her expected blossoms be past in vain.  It will easily be true that a father or a brother may be hated <a href="" id="zealous" class="annotBtn">zealously</a>, and <span class="varspell" title="loved">lov'd</span> civilly or naturally; for those duties may be <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</span> at distance, and <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> admit of any long absence, but how the peace and <span class="varspell" title="perpetual">perpetuall</span> cohabitation of marriage can be kept, how that benevolent and <a href="" id="communion" class="annotBtn">intimate communion of body</a> can be held with one that must be hated with a most operative hatred, must be <span class="varspell" title="forsaken">forsak'n</span> and yet continually dwelt with and accompanied, he who can distinguish, hath the gift of an affection very <span class="varspell" title="oddly">odly</span> divided and <span class="varspell" title="contrived">contriv'd</span>: while others both just and wise, and <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Solomon">Salomon</span></span> among the rest, if they may not hate and forsake as <span class="mi">Moses</span> <span class="varspell" title="enjoins">enjoyns</span>, and the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> imports, will find it impossible not to love otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> will sort with the love of God, whose <span class="varspell" title="Jealousy">jealousie</span> brooks no <span class="varspell" title="corival">corrivall</span>.  And whether is more likely, that Christ bidding to forsake wife for religion, meant it by divorce as <span class="mi">Moses</span> meant it, whose Law grounded on <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> reason, was both his office and his essence to maintain, or that he should bring a new morality into religion, not only new, but contrary to an unchangeable command, and dangerously derogating from our love <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> worship of God.  As if when <span class="mi">Moses</span> had bid divorce absolutely, and Christ had said, hate <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> forsake, and his Apostle had said, no communion with Christ <span class="varspell" title="and">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">Belial</span>, yet that Christ after all this could be understood to say, divorce not, no not for religion, seduce, or seduce not.  What mighty and invisible <a href="" id="remora" class="annotBtn">Remora</a> is this in matrimony able to <span class="varspell" title="demur">demurre</span>, and to <span class="varspell" title="condemn">contemne</span> all the divorsive engines in heaven or earth.  Both which may now <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> away if this be true, for more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> many <a href="" id="tittle" class="annotBtn">jots or tittles,</a> a whole <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> Law is <span class="varspell" title="abolished">abolisht</span>.  But if we dare <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> it is not, then in the method of religion, and to save the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> and dignity of our faith, we are to retreat, and gather up our selves from the observance of an inferior and <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> ordinance, to the strict maintaining of a <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> and religious command, which is written, <span class="mi">Thou shalt make no <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> with them</span>, <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> <a href="" id="verses723" class="annotBtn">7. 2. 3</a>. and that <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> which cannot be lawfully made, we have directions and examples lawfully to dissolve.  Also <a href="" id="chap19:2" class="annotBtn">2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 19. 2</a>. <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Shouldest">Shouldst</span> thou love them that hate the Lord</span>?  No <a href="" id="doubtlesse" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span></a>: for there is a certain scale of duties, there is a certain Hierarchy of upper and lower commands, which for want of studying in right order, all the world is in confusion.</p>
<p>
Upon these principles I answer, that a right <span class="varspell" title="believer">beleever</span> ought to divorce an idolatrous <span class="varspell" title="heretic">heretick</span> <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> upon better hopes: however, that it is in the <span class="varspell" title="believer's">beleevers</span> choice to divorce or not.</p>
<p>
The former part will be manifest thus; first, an apostate idolater whether husband or wife seducing was to die by the decree of God, <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> <a href="" id="chap13:6" class="annotBtn">13. 6, 9</a>. that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> God himself dis-<span class="varspell" title="joins">joyns</span>: for others born idolaters the <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> reason of their dangerous keeping and the incommunicable <a href="" id="antagony" class="annotBtn">antagony</a> that is between Christ and <span class="mi">Belial</span>, will be sufficient to enforce the commandment of those two <span class="varspell" title="inspired">inspir'd</span> reformers, <span class="mi">Ezra</span> and <span class="mi">Nehemiah</span>, to put an Idolater away as well under the Gospel.
</p>
<p>The latter part, that although there be no seducement <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, yet if there be no hope <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span>, the divorce is <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>, will <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> by this, that idolatrous marriage is still <span class="varspell" title="hateful">hatefull</span> to God, <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> still it may be <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span> by the <span class="varspell" title="pattern">patern</span> of that warrant that <span class="mi">Ezra</span> had; and by the same everlasting reason: Neither can any man give an account wherefore, if those whom God <span class="varspell" title="joins">joyns</span>, no man may separate, it should not follow, that, whom he <span class="varspell" title="joins">joyns</span> not, but hates to <span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span>, those man ought to separate:  but saith the Lawyer, that which ought not have been <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, once <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, avails.  I answer, this is but a crotchet of the <a href="" id="law" class="annotBtn">law</a>, but that brought against it, is plain Scripture.  As for what Christ spake concerning divorce, tis <span class="varspell" title="confessed">confest</span> by all knowing men, he meant <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> between them of the same faith.  But what shall we say then to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>, who <span class="varspell" title="seems">seemes</span> to bid us not divorce an <span class="varspell" title="Infidel">Infidell</span> willing to stay?  We may safely say thus; that wrong collections have been hitherto made out of those words by modern Divines.  His drift, as was heard before, is plain: not to command our stay in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> with an Infidel, that had been a flat renouncing of the religious and <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> Law; but to inform the <span class="mi">Corinthians</span> that the body of an <span class="varspell" title="unbeliever">unbeleever</span> was not defiling, if his desire to live in Christian wedlock <span class="varspell" title="showed">shewd</span> any likelihood that his heart was opening to the faith: and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> advises to forbear departure so long, till nothing have been neglected to set forward a conversion: this I say he advises, and that with certain cautions; not commands: If we can take up so much credit for him, as to get him <span class="varspell" title="believed">beleev'd</span> upon his own word; for what is this <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> but his <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> in a thing indifferent, <span class="mi">to the rest speak I, not the Lord</span>; for though it be true that the Lord never spake it, yet from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paul's">Pauls</span></span> mouth we should have took it as a command, had not himself <span class="varspell" title="forewarned">forewarn'd</span> us, and <span class="varspell" title="disclaimed">disclaim'd</span>; which, notwithstanding if we shall still avouch to be a command, he palpably denying it, this is not to expound <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>, but to out-face him.  Neither doth it follow, but that the Apostle may interpose his judgement in a case of Christian liberty without the guilt of adding to <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> word.

Why shall not the like words have leave to <span class="varspell" title="signify">signifie</span> a freedom in this our present question, though <span class="mi">Beza</span> deny.  Neither is the Scripture hereby <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="inspired">inspir'd</span> because <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span> confesses to have <span class="varspell" title="written">writt'n</span> therein what he had not of command; for we grant that the Spirit of God led him thus to <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> himself to Christian prudence in a matter which God thought best to leave uncommanded.  <span class="mi">Beza</span> therefore must be warily read when he taxes <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Augustine">Austine</span></span> of <span class="mi">Blasphemy</span> for holding that  <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span>  spake <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> as of a thing indifferent:  but if it must be a command, I shall yet the more evince it to be a command that we should herein be left free: and that out of the Greek word <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> in the 12.<abbr title="Verse">V.</abbr> which instructs us plainly there must be a <span class="varspell" title="joint">joynt</span> assent and good liking on both sides; he that will not deprave the Text, must thus render it; <span class="mi">If a brother have an <span class="varspell" title="unbelieving">unbeleeving</span> wife, and she <span class="varspell" title="join">joyne</span> in consent to dwell with him</span> (which cannot utter <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> to us <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a <span class="varspell" title="mutual">mutuall</span> agreement) let him not put her away for the <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> surmise of <span class="varspell" title="Judaical">Judaicall</span> <span class="varspell" title="uncleanness">uncleannes</span>: and the reason follows, for the body of an <span class="varspell" title="infidel">infidell</span> is not polluted, neither to benevolence, nor to procreation.  Moreover, this note of <span class="varspell" title="mutual">mutuall</span> <span class="varspell" title="complacency">complacencie</span> forbids all offer of seducement; which to a person of zeal cannot be attempted without great offence, if <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> seducement be <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, this place hinders not divorce.  Another caution was put in this supposed command, of not bringing the <span class="varspell" title="believer">beleever</span> into <span class="mi">bondage</span> <span class="varspell" title="hereby">heerby</span>, which <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtles</span> might prove extreme, if Christian liberty and conscience were left to the humor of a pagan staying at pleasure to play with, or to vex and wound with a thousand scandals and burdens, above strength to bear: If therefore the conceived hope of gaining a soul, come to nothing, then charity commands that the <span class="varspell" title="believer">beleever</span> be not wearied out with <span class="varspell" title="endless">endlesse</span> waiting under many grievances sore to his spirit; but that respect be had rather to the present suffering of a true Christian, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the uncertain winning of an <span class="varspell" title="obdured">obdur'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="heretic">heretick</span>.

The Apostle wisheth us to hope, but does not send us a <span class="varspell" title="wool">wooll</span>-gathering after vain hope: he saith, <span class="mi">How knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt <a href="" id="save" class="annotBtn">save</a> thy wife</span>, that is, till he try all due means, and set some reasonable time to <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> after which he may give over washing an <a href="" id="ethiope" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Ethiopian">Ethiope</span></a>, if he will <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> the advice of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>. <span class="mi">Cast not pearls before swine</span>, saith Christ himself.  <span class="mi">Let him be to thee as a heathen.

Thou shalt not plow with an <span class="varspell" title="Ox">Oxe</span> and an <span class="varspell" title="Ass">Asse</span> together</span>; and the like.

Yea the Apostle himself in the forecited 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 6.14. alludes from that place of <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> to forbid mis-yoking <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>; as by the Greek word is evident, though he instance but in one example of mis-matching with an <span class="varspell" title="Infidel">Infidell</span>: yet next to that what can be a fouler incongruity, a greater violence to the reverend secret of nature, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to force a mixture of minds that cannot unite, and to <span class="varspell" title="sow">sowe</span> the furrow of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> nativity with seed of two incoherent and uncombining dispositions; which act being kindly and <span class="varspell" title="voluntary">voluntarie</span>, as it ought, the Apostle in the language he wrote <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> <span class="mi">Eunoia</span>, and the <span class="varspell" title="Latins">Latines</span> <a href="" id="benevolence" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Benevolence</span></a>, intimating the original <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> to be in the understanding and the will; if not, surely there is nothing which might more properly be <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> a malevolence rather; and is the most injurious and <span class="varspell" title="unnaturl">unnaturall</span> tribute that can be extorted from a person <span class="varspell" title="endowed">endew'd</span> with reason, to be made pay out the <a href="" id="substance" class="annotBtn">best substance of his body</a>, and of his soul too, as some think, when either for just and <span class="varspell" title="powerful">powerfull</span> causes he cannot like, or from <span class="varspell" title="unequal">unequall</span> causes finds not <span class="varspell" title="recompense">recompence</span>.  And that there is a hidden <span class="varspell" title="efficacy">efficacie</span> of love and hatred in man as <span class="varspell" title="well">wel</span> as in other kinds, not <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span>, but <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span>, which though not <span class="varspell" title="always">alwayes</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="choice">choyce</span>, yet in the <span class="varspell" title="success">successe</span> of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> ever be most predominant, besides daily experience, the author of <span class="mi">Ecclesiasticus</span>, whose <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisedom</span> hath set him next the Bible, acknowledges, 13. 16.  <span class="mi">A man</span>, saith he, <span class="mi">will cleave to his like.</span>  But what might be the cause, whether each <span class="varspell" title="one's">ones</span> allotted <span class="mi">Genius</span> or proper <span class="varspell" title="Star">Starre</span>, or whether the <span class="varspell" title="supernal">supernall</span> influence of Schemes and angular aspects or this <span class="varspell" title="elemental">elementall</span> <a href="" id="crasis" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Crasis</span></a> here below, whether all these jointly or singly meeting friendly, or unfriendly in either party, I dare not, with the men I am likest to clash, appear so much a Philosopher as to conjecture.  The ancient proverb in <span class="mi">Homer</span> <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> abstruse <span class="varspell" title="entitles">intitles</span> this <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> of leading each like person to his like, peculiarly to God <a href="" id="himselfe" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span></a>: which is plain <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> also by his naming of a meet or like help in the first <span class="varspell" title="espousal">espousall</span> instituted; and that every woman is meet for every man, none so absurd as to affirm.  Seeing then there is indeed a twofold Seminary or stock in nature, from whence are <span class="varspell" title="derived">deriv'd</span> the issues of love and hatred distinctly flowing through the whole <span class="varspell" title="mass">masse</span> of created things, and that <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> doing ever is to bring the due likenesses and harmonies of his <span class="varspell" title="works">workes</span> together, except when out of two contraries met to their own destruction, he <span class="varspell" title="molds">moulds</span> a third existence, and that it is error, or some evil Angel which either blindly or maliciously hath drawn together in two persons ill <span class="varspell" title="embarked">imbarkt</span> in wedlock the sleeping discords and enmities of nature <span class="varspell" title="lulled">lull'd</span> on purpose with some false bait, that they may wake to agony and strife, later <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> prevention could have <span class="varspell" title="wished">wisht</span>, if from the bent of just and honest intentions beginning what was begun, and so continuing, all that is <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span>, all that is fair and possible hath been <span class="varspell" title="tried">tri'd</span>, and no accommodation likely to succeed, what folly is it still to stand <span class="varspell" title="combatting">combating</span> and battering against invincible causes and effects, with <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> upon <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, till either the best of our <span class="varspell" title="days">dayes</span> be <span class="varspell" title="lingered">linger'd</span> out, or ended with some speeding sorrow.  The wise <span class="mi">Ecclesiasticus</span> advises rather, 37. 27.  <span class="mi">My <span class="varspell" title="son">sonne</span>, prove thy <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> in thy life, see what is <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> for it, and give not that unto it.</span>  Reason he had to say so; for if the <span class="varspell" title="noisomeness">noysomness</span> or disfigurement of body can soon destroy the sympathy of mind to wedlock duties, much more <span class="varspell" title="will"><span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span></span> the annoyance and trouble of mind infuse it self into all the faculties and acts of the body, to render them invalid, unkindly, and even unholy against the <span class="varspell" title="fundamental">fundamentall</span> law book of nature; which <span class="mi">Moses</span> never thwarts, but reverences: therefore he commands us to force nothing against sympathy or <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> order,  no not upon the most abject creatures; to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> that such an indignity cannot be <span class="varspell" title="offered">offer'd</span> to man without an impious crime.  And certainly those divine meditating words of finding out a meet and like help to man, have in them a consideration of more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the indefinite <span class="varspell" title="likeness">likenesse</span> of womanhood; nor are they to be made waste paper on, for the <span class="varspell" title="dullness">dulnesse</span> of Canon divinity: no nor those other <span class="varspell" title="allegoric">allegorick</span> precepts of beneficence <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetcht</span> out of the closet of nature to teach us <span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnes</span> and compassion in not compelling together unmatchable societies, or if they meet through mischance, by all consequence to dis-<span class="varspell" title="join">joyn</span> them, as God and nature signifies and lectures to us not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> by those recited decrees, but <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> by the first and last of all his visible works; when by his divorcing command the world first rose out of <a href="" id="chaos" class="annotBtn">Chaos</a>, nor can be <span class="varspell" title="renewed">renew'd</span> again out of confusion but by the separating of unmeet consorts.</p>

<span class="varspell" title="Eighthly"><span class="minitial">E</span>ighthly</span>, It is most sure that some <span class="varspell" title="even">ev'n</span> of those who are not plainly defective in body, yet are <span class="varspell" title="destitute">destitut</span> of all other <span class="varspell" title="marriageable">mariageable</span> gifts; and consequently have not the calling to marry; <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> nothing be requisite <span class="varspell" title="thereto">therto</span> but a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> <span class="varspell" title="instrumental">instrumentall</span> body; which to affirm, is to that unanimous Covenant a reproach: yet it is as sure that many such, not of their own desire, but by the <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> of friends, or not knowing themselves <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> often enter into wedlock; where finding the difference at length between the duties of a married life, and the gifts of a single life; what <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnes</span> of mind, what <span class="varspell" title="wearisomeness">wearisomnesse</span>, what scruples and doubts to an incredible offence and displeasure are like to follow between, may be soon <span class="varspell" title="imagined">imagin'd</span>: whom thus <a href="" id="immure" class="annotBtn">to immure and shut up  together</a>, the one with a mischosen mate, the other in a <span class="varspell" title="mistaken">mistak'n</span> calling, is not a <span class="varspell" title="course">cours</span> that Christian <q class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisedome</q> and <span class="varspell" title="tenderness">tendernesse</span> ought to use.  As for the <span class="varspell" title="custom">custome</span> that some parents and guardians have of forcing <span class="varspell" title="marriages">mariages</span>, it will be better to say nothing of such a savage inhumanity, but only this, that the Law which gives not all freedom of divorce to any creature <span class="varspell" title="endued">endu'd</span> with reason so assassinated, is next in cruelty.</p>

<span class="msummary">The ninth reason, Because <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is not a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> coition, but a human Society, where that cannot reasonably be had, there can be no true matrimony.  <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> <span class="varspell" title="compared">compar'd</span> with all other <span class="varspell" title="covenants">cov'nants</span> and <span class="varspell" title="vows">vowes</span> warrantably broken for the good of man.  <span class="varspell" title="Marriage">Mariage</span> the <span class="varspell" title="Papist's">Papists</span> Sacrament, and unfit <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> the <span class="varspell" title="Protestant's">Protestants</span> <span class="varspell" title="Idol">Idoll</span>.</span>
</p>
 
<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="Ninthly"><span class="minitial">N</span>inthly</span>, I suppose it will be <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> us that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is a human Society, and that all human society must proceed from the mind rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the body, <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> it would be but a kind of <span class="varspell" title="animal">animall</span> or beastish meeting; if the mind <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> <a href="" id="cannot" class="annotBtn">cannot</a> have that due company by <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, that it may reasonably and humanly desire, that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> can be no human society, but a certain formality; or <span class="varspell" title="gilding">guilding</span> over of little better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a brutish <span class="varspell" title="congress">congresse</span>, and so in very <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> and <span class="varspell" title="pureness">purenesse</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="dissolved">dissolv'd</span>.
</p>
<p>But <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> human, <span class="mi">the <span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> of God</span>, <abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr> 2. 17. <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> man cannot dissolve it.  I answer, if it be more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> human so much the more it argues the <span class="varspell" title="chief">chiefe</span> society thereof to be in the <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in the body, and the greatest breach <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnesse</span> of mind rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> defect of body: for the body can have least affinity in a <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> human, so that the reason of dissolving holds good the rather.  Again, I answer, that the Sabbath is a higher institution, a command of the <a href="" id="firsttable" class="annotBtn">first Table</a>, for the breach <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> God hath <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> more and <span class="varspell" title="oftener">oftner</span> <span class="varspell" title="testified">testify'd</span> his anger <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> for divorces, which from <span class="mi">Moses</span> to <a href="" id="malachy" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Malachi">Malachy</span></span></a> he never took displeasure at, nor then neither, if we mark the Text, and yet as oft as the good of Man is <span class="varspell" title="concerned">concern'd</span>, he not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> permits, but commands to break the Sabbath.  What <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> more contracted with God, and <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> in <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> power, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the vow which hath once <span class="varspell" title="passed">past</span> his lips? yet if it be found rash, if offensive, if <span class="varspell" title="unfruitful">unfruitfull</span> either to <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> glory or the good of man, our doctrine forces not error and <span class="varspell" title="unwillingness">unwillingnes</span> <span class="varspell" title="irksomely">irksomly</span> to keep it, but counsels <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisedom</span> and better thoughts boldly to break it; <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> to <span class="varspell" title="enjoin">enjoyn</span> the indissoluble keeping of a <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> found unfit against the good of man both soul and body, as hath been <span class="varspell" title="evidenced">evidenc't</span>, is to make an Idol of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>, to advance it above the worship of God and the good of man, to make it a transcendent command, above both the second and first Table, which is a most prodigious doctrine.
</p>
<p>Next, Whereas they cite out of the <span class="mi">Proverbs</span>, that it is the <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> of God</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> human, that consequence is manifestly false; for so the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> which <span class="mi">Zedechiah</span> made with the <span class="varspell" title="Infidel">Infidell</span> King of <span class="mi">Babel</span>, is <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> the <a href="" id="covnantofGod" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Covenant">Covnant</span> of God</span></a>, <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 17. 19. which would be strange to <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> counted more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a human <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span>.  So every <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> between man and man, bound by oath, may be <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> the <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> of God, because God <span class="varspell" title="therein">therin</span> is attested.  So of <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> he is the <span class="varspell" title="author">authour</span> and the <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnes</span>; yet hence will not follow any divine <a href="" id="astriction" class="annotBtn">astriction</a> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> what is subordinate to the glory of God and the main good of either party; for as the glory of God and their esteemed <span class="varspell" title="fitness">fitnesse</span> one for the other, was the motive which led them both at first to think without other revelation that God had <span class="varspell" title="joined">joynd</span> them together, So when it shall be found by their apparent <span class="varspell" title="unfitness">unfitnesse</span>, that their continuing to be man and wife is against the glory of God and their <span class="varspell" title="mutual">mutuall</span> <span class="varspell" title="happiness">happinesse</span>, it may assure them that God never <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> them; who hath <span class="varspell" title="revealed">reveal'd</span> his gracious will not to set the ordinance above the man for whom it was <a href="" id="ordained" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span></a>: not to canonize <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> either as a <span class="varspell" title="tyraness">tyrannesse</span> or a <span class="varspell" title="goddess">goddesse</span> over the <span class="varspell" title="enfranchised">enfranchiz'd</span> life and soul of man; for <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> can God delight, <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> be <span class="varspell" title="worshipped">worshipt</span>, wherein be <span class="varspell" title="glorified">glorify'd</span> by the forcible continuing of an improper and ill-yoking couple?  He that <span class="varspell" title="loved">lov'd</span> not to see the disparity of <span class="varspell" title="several">severall</span> <span class="varspell" title="cattle">cattell</span> at the plow, cannot be <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> with vast <span class="varspell" title="unmeetness">unmeetnesse</span> in <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span>.  Where can be the peace and love which must invite God to such a house,  may it not be <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span> that the not divorcing of such a <span class="varspell" title="helpless">helplesse</span> disagreement, will be the divorcing of God finally from such a place?  But it is a <span class="varspell" title="trial">triall</span> of our patience they say: I grant it: but which of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Job's">Jobs</span></span> afflictions were sent him with that law, that he might not use means to remove any of them if he could?  And what if it subvert our patience and our faith too?  Who shall answer for the perishing of all those souls perishing by stubborn expositions of particular and inferior precepts against the <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> and supreme rule of charity?  They dare not affirm that <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> is either a Sacrament, or a mystery, though all those sacred things give place to man, and yet they invest it with  such an <span class="varspell" title="awful">awfull</span> sanctity, and give such <a href="" id="chains" class="annotBtn">adamantine chains</a> to bind with, as if it were to be <span class="varspell" title="worshipped">worshipt</span> like some <span class="mi">Indian</span> deity, when it can <span class="varspell" title="confer">conferre</span> no blessing upon us, but works more and more to our misery.  To such teachers the saying of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Peter</span> at the <span class="varspell" title="Council">Councell</span> of <span class="mi">Jerusalem</span> will <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> well to be <a href="" id="acts" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="applied">apply'd</span></a>: <span class="mi">Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the necks</span> of Christian men, which neither the <span class="mi">Jews</span>, <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> ancient people, <span class="mi"> nor we are able to bear:</span> and nothing but unwary expounding hath brought upon us.</p>

<p>
<span class="msummary">Considerations concerning Familisms, <span class="varspell" title="Antinomianism">Antinomianisme</span>, and why it may be thought that such opinions may proceed from the undue restraint of some just liberty, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> which no greater cause to <span class="varspell" title="contemn">contemne</span> discipline.</span>
</p>
<p class="first">
<span class="varspell" title="To"><span class="minitial">T</span>o</span> these considerations this also may be added as no improbable conjecture; seeing that sort of men who follow <span class="mi">Anabaptism, Familism, Antinomianism</span>, and other <span class="varspell" title="fanatic">fanatick</span> <a href="" id="dreams" class="annotBtn">dreams</a> (if we understand them not <span class="varspell" title="amiss">amisse</span>) be such most commonly as are by nature addicted to Religion; of life also not <span class="varspell" title="debauched">debausht</span>, and that their opinions having full <span class="varspell" title="swing">swinge</span>, do end in satisfaction of the flesh, it may be come with reason into the thoughts of a wise man, whether all this proceed not partly, if not chiefly, from the restraint of some <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> liberty, which ought to be <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> men, and is <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> them.  As by <span class="varspell" title="Physic">Physick</span> we learn in menstruous bodies, where <span class="varspell" title="nature's">natures</span> current hath been <span class="varspell" title="stopped">stopt</span>, that the suffocation and upward forcing of some lower part, affects the head and inward sense with dotage and idle fancies.  And on the other hand, whether the rest of vulgar men not so religiously professing, do not give <span class="varspell" title="themselves">themselvs</span> much the more to whoredom and adulteries, loving the corrupt and venial discipline of <span class="varspell" title="clergy">clergie</span> Courts, but hating to hear of perfect reformation: when as they foresee that then fornication shall be austerely <span class="varspell" title="censured">censur'd</span>, adultery <span class="varspell" title="punished">punisht</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> the appointed refuge of nature, though it hap to be never so incongruous and displeasing, must yet of force be worn out, when it can be to no other purpose but of strife and hatred, a thing odious to God.  This may be worth the study of <span class="varspell" title="skillful">skilfull</span> men in Theology, and the reason of things:  and lastly to examine whether some undue and ill grounded <span class="varspell" title="strictness">strictnesse</span> upon the <span class="varspell" title="blameless">blamelesse</span> nature of man, be not the cause <a href="" id="places" class="annotBtn">in those places</a> where already reformation is, that the discipline of the Church so often and so unavoidably <span class="varspell" title="broken">brok'n</span>, is brought into contempt and derision.  And if it be thus, let those who are still bent to hold this obstinate <span class="mi">literality</span>, so prepare themselves as to share in the account for all these transgressions, when it shall be demanded at the last day by one who will scan and sift things with more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a <span class="varspell" title="literal">literall</span> <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisedom</span> of equity.  For if these reasons be duly <span class="varspell" title="pondered">ponder'd</span>, and that the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> is more jealous of laying on excessive burdens <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ever the Law was, lest the <span class="varspell" title="soul">soule</span> of a Christian which is inestimable, should be over-tempted and cast away, considering also that many properties of nature, which the power of regeneration it <span class="varspell" title="self">selfe</span> never alters, may cause dislike of conversing even between the most <span class="varspell" title="sanctified">sanctify'd</span>, which continually grating in harsh tune together may breed some <span class="varspell" title="jar">jarre</span> and discord, and that end in rancor and strife, a thing so opposite both to <span class="varspell" title="marriage">mariage</span> and to Christianity, it would perhaps be <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="scandal">schandall</span> to divorce a <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> disparity, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to link violently together an unchristian dissention, committing two ensnared <span class="varspell" title="souls">soules</span> inevitably to kindle one another, not with the fire of love, but with a hatred <a href="" id="rareword" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">inconcileable</span></a>,  who were they dissevered, would be straight friends in any other relation.  But if an <a href="" id="alphabetical" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="alphabetical">alphabeticall</span></a> servility must be still urged, it may so fall out, that the true Church may unwittingly use as much cruelty in forbidding to divorce, as the Church of Antichrist doth wilfully in forbidding to marry.</p>
