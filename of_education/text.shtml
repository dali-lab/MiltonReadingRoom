<p class="first">
<span class="minitial">I</span> am long since <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span>, that to say, or do ought worth memory and imitation, no purpose or respect should sooner move us, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> simply the love of God, and of mankind. Nevertheless to write now the reforming of Education, though it be one of the greatest and noblest designs that can be thought on, and for the want whereof this Nation perishes, I had not yet at this time been <span class="varspell" title="induced">induc't</span>, but by your earnest entreaties, and serious conjurements; as having my mind for the present half diverted in the pursuance of some other assertions, the knowledge and the use of which, cannot but be a great furtherance both to the enlargement of truth, and honest living, with much more peace. Nor should the laws of any private friendship have <span class="varspell" title="prevailed">prevail'd</span> with me to divide thus, or transpose my former thoughts, but that I see those aims, those actions which have won you with me the esteem of a person sent hither by some good providence from a <a href="" id="far" class="annotBtn">far country</a> to be the occasion and the incitement of great good to this Island. And, as I hear, you have <span class="varspell" title="obtained">obtain'd</span> the same repute with men of most approved wisdom, and som of the highest authority among us.  Not to mention the learned correspondence which you hold in forreign parts, and the extraordinary pains and diligence which you have <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> in this matter both here, and beyond the Seas; either by the definite will of God so ruling, or the peculiar sway of nature, which also is <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> working. Neither can I think that so reputed, and so <span class="varspell" title="valued">valu'd</span> as you are, you would to the forfeit of your own discerning ability, impose upon me an unfit and over-ponderous argument, but that the satisfaction which you profess to have <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span> from those incidental Discourses which we have <span class="varspel" title="wandered">wander'd</span> into, hath <span class="varspell" title="pressed">prest</span> and almost <span class="varspell" title="constrained">constrain'd</span> you into a <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span>, that what you require from me in this point, I neither ought nor can in conscience <span class="varspell" title="defer">deferre</span> beyond this time both of so much need at once, and so much opportunity to try what God hath <span class="varspell" title="determined">determin'd</span>. I will not resist therefore, whatever it is either of divine, or <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> obligement that you lay upon me; but will forthwith set down in writing, as you request me, that <a href="" id="voluntary" class="annotBtn">voluntary</a> <a href="" id="idea" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Idea</span></a>, which hath long in silence presented it self to me, of a better Education, in extent and comprehension far more large, and yet of time far shorter, and of attainment far more certain, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> hath been yet in practice. Brief I shall <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> to be; for that which I have to say, assuredly this Nation hath <span class="varspell" title="extreme">extream</span> need should be done sooner <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> spoken. To tell you therefore what I have benefited herein among old renowned Authors, I shall spare; and to search what many modern <a href="" id="januas" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Januas">Janua's</span></span> and <span class="booktitle">Didactics</span></a> more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ever I shall read, have projected, my inclination leads me not. But if you can accept of these few observations which have <a href="" id="flowrd" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="flowered">flowr'd</span> off</a>, and are, as it were, the burnishing of many studious and contemplative years altogether spent in the search of religious and civil knowledge, and such as <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> you so well in the relating, I here give you them to dispose of.</p>

<p>
<a id="ruines" name="ruines"></a>The end then of Learning is to repair the <a href="" id="ruins" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="ruins">ruines</span> of our first Parents</a> by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love him, to imitate him, to be like him, as we may the <span class="varspell" title="nearest">neerest</span> by possessing our souls of true <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, which being united to the heavenly grace of faith makes up the highest perfection. But because our understanding cannot in this body found it self but on sensible things, nor arrive so clearly to the knowledge of God and things invisible, as by orderly <a href="" id="conning" class="annotBtn">conning over</a> the visible and inferior creature, the same method is necessarily to be <span class="varspell" title="followed">follow'd</span> in all discreet teaching. And seeing every Nation affords not experience and tradition enough for all kind of Learning, therefore we are chiefly taught the Languages of those people who have at any time been most industrious after Wisdom; so that Language is but the Instrument conveying to us things <span class="varspell" title="useful">usefull</span> to be known. And though a Linguist should pride himself to have all the Tongues that <span class="mi">Babel</span> cleft the world into, yet, if he have not studied the solid things in them as well as the Words &amp; Lexicons, he were nothing so much to be <span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteem'd</span> a learned man, as any Yeoman or Tradesman competently wise in his Mother Dialect only. Hence appear the many mistakes which have made Learning generally so unpleasing and so unsuccessful; first, we do amiss to spend seven or eight years meerly in scraping together so much miserable <span class="varspell" title="Latin">Latine</span> and Greek, as might be <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span> otherwise easily and delightfully in one year. And that which casts our proficiency therein so much behind, is our time lost partly in too oft idle <a href="" id="vacancies" class="annotBtn">vacancies</a> given both to Schools and Universities, partly in a <a href="" id="preposterous" class="annotBtn">preposterous exaction,</a> forcing the empty wits of Children to compose <span class="varpell" title="Themes">Theams</span>, Verses and Orations, which are the acts of ripest judgment and the final work of a head <span class="varspell" title="filled">fill'd</span> by long reading and observing, with elegant maxims, and <a href="" id="copious" class="annotBtn">copious invention</a>. These are not matters to be wrung from poor striplings, like blood out of the Nose, or the plucking of untimely fruit: besides the ill habit which they get of wretched <a href="" id="barbarizing" class="annotBtn">barbarizing</a> against the Latin and Greek <span class="mi">idiom</span>, with their <span class="varspell" title="untutored">untutor'd</span> <a href="" id="anglicisms" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Anglicisms</span></a>, odious to be read, yet not to be avoided without a well <span class="varspell" title="continued">continu'd</span> and <a href="" id="judicious" class="annotBtn">judicious conversing</a> among pure Authors digested, which they scarce taste, whereas, if after some preparatory grounds of speech by their certain forms got into memory, they were led to the <a href="" id="praxis" class="annotBtn">praxis</a> thereof in some chosen short book <span class="varspell" title="lessoned">lesson'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span> to them, they might then forthwith proceed to learn the substance of good things, and <a href="" id="arts" class="annotBtn">Arts</a> in due order, which would bring the whole language quickly into their power. This I take to be the most rational and most profitable way of learning Languages, and whereby we may best hope to give account to God of our youth spent herein: And for the usual method of teaching Arts, I deem it to be an old <span class="varspell" title="error">errour</span> of Universities not yet well <span class="varspell" title="recovered">recover'd</span> from the <span class="varspell" title="Scholastic">Scholastick</span> grossness of barbarous ages, that in stead of beginning with Arts most <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span>, and those be such as are most obvious to the <span class="varspell" title="sense">sence</span>, they present their young <a href="" id="unmatriculated" class="annotBtn">unmatriculated</a> Novices at first <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> with the most intellective abstractions of <a href="" id="logick" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Logic">Logick</span></a> and <a href="" id="metapysicks" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Metaphysics">Metapysicks</span></a>: So that they having but newly left those <span class="varspell" title="Grammatic">Grammatick</span> flats and shallows where they stuck unreasonably to learn a few words with lamentable construction, and now on the sudden transported under another climate to be <span class="varspell" title="tossed">tost</span> and <span class="varspell" title="turmoiled">turmoil'd</span> with their unballasted wits in <span class="varspell" title="fathomless">fadomless</span> and unquiet deeps of <a href="" id="controversie" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span></a>, do for the most part grow into hatred and contempt of Learning, <span class="varspell" title="mocked">mockt</span> and deluded all this while with ragged Notions and <a href="" id="babblements" class="annotBtn">Babblements,</a> while they expected worthy and delightful knowledge; till poverty or youthful years call them importunately their several <span class="varspell" title="ways">wayes</span> and hasten them with the sway of friends either to an ambitious and mercenary, or ignorantly zealous <a href="" id="divinity" class="annotBtn">Divinity</a>; Some <span class="varspell" title="allured">allur'd</span> to the trade of Law, grounding their purposes not on the prudent and heavenly contemplation of justice and equity which was never taught them, but on the promising and pleasing thoughts of <a href="" id="litigious" class="annotBtn">litigious terms,</a> fat contentions, and flowing fees; others betake them to State affairs, with souls so <span class="varspell" title="unprincipled">unprincipl'd</span> in <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, and true generous breeding, that flattery, and Court <a href="" id="shifts" class="annotBtn">shifts</a> and <a href="" id="tyrannous" class="annotBtn">tyrannous Aphorisms</a> appear to them the highest points of wisdom; instilling their barren hearts with a conscientious slavery, if, as I rather think, it be not <span class="varspell" title="feined">fain'd</span>.  Others lastly of a more <a href="" id="delicious" class="annotBtn">delicious</a> and <a href="" id="airie" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="airy">airie</span></a> spirit, retire themselves knowing no better, to the enjoyments of ease and luxury, living out their <span class="varspell" title="days">daies</span> in feast and jollity; which indeed is the wisest and the safest course of all these, unless they were with more integrity undertaken. And these are the fruits of mispending our prime youth at the Schools and Universities as we do, either in learning <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> words or such things chiefly, as were better <span class="varspell" title="unlearned">unlearnt</span>.
</p>
<p>
I shall detain you no longer in the demonstration of what we should not do, but <span class="varspell" title="straight">strait</span> conduct ye to a hill side, where I will point ye out the right path of a <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> and noble Education; laborious indeed at the first ascent, but else so smooth, so green, so full of goodly prospect, and melodious sounds on every side, that the Harp of <a href="" id="orpheus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Orpheus</span></a> was not more charming. I doubt not but ye shall have more <span class="varspell" title="ado">adoe</span> to drive our dullest and laziest youth, our <a href="" id="stocks" class="annotBtn">stocks and stubbs</a> from the infinite desire of such a happy nurture, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> we have now to <a href="" id="hale" class="annotBtn">hale</a> and drag our <span class="varspell" title="choicest">choisest</span> and hopefullest Wits to that asinine feast of <a href="" id="sowthistles" class="annotBtn">sowthistles</a> and brambles which is commonly set before them, as all the food and entertainment of their tenderest and most docible age. I call therefore a <span class="varspell" title="complete">compleat</span> and generous Education that which fits a man to perform justly, skilfully and magnanimously all the offices both private and <span class="varspell" title="piblic">publick</span> of Peace and <a href="" id="war" class="annotBtn">War</a>. And how all this may be done between twelve, and one and twenty, less time <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> is now <span class="varspell" title="bestowed">bestow'd</span> in pure trifling at Grammar and <span class="mi">Sophistry</span>, is to be thus <span class="varspell" title="ordered">order'd</span>.
</p>
<p>
First, to find out a <span class="varspell" title="spacious">spatious</span> house and ground about it fit for an <span class="mi">Academy</span>, and big enough to lodge a hundred and fifty persons, whereof twenty or thereabout may be attendants, all under the government of one, who shall be thought of desert sufficient, and ability either to do all, or wisely to direct, and oversee it done. This place should be at once both School and University, not needing a remove to any other house of <span class="varspell" title="Scholarship">Schollership</span>, except it be some <a href="" id="peculiar" class="annotBtn">peculiar</a> <span class="varspell" title="College">Colledge</span> of Law, or <a href="" id="physick" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Physic">Physick</span></a>, where they mean to be practitioners; but as for those general studies which take up all our time from <a href="" id="lilly" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Lilly</span></a> to the commencing, as they term it, Master of Art, it should be <a href="" id="absolute" class="annotBtn">absolute</a>. After this pattern, as many Edifices may be converted to this use, as shall be needful in every City throughout this Land, which would tend much to the encrease of Learning and <a href="" id="civility" class="annotBtn">Civility</a> every where. This number, less or more thus collected, to the <a href="" id="convenience" class="annotBtn">convenience of</a> a <a href="" id="foot" class="annotBtn">foot Company,</a> or interchangeably two Troops of Cavalry, should divide their daies work into three parts, as it lies orderly. Their Studies, their Exercise, and their Diet.
</p>
<p>
For their Studies, First they should begin with the chief and necessary rules of some good Grammar, either that now <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, or any better: and while this is doing, their speech is to be <span class="varspell" title="fashioned">fashion'd</span> to a distinct and clear <span class="varspell" title="pronunciation">pronuntiation</span>, as near as may be to the <a href="" id="italian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Italian</span></a>, especially in the Vowels. For we <span class="mi">Englishmen</span> being far Northerly, do not open our mouths in the cold air, wide enough to grace a Southern Tongue; but are <span class="varspell" title="observed">observ'd</span> by all other Nations to speak exceeding close and inward: So that to <a href="" id="smatter" class="annotBtn">smatter</a> <span class="varspell" title="Latin">Latine</span> with an English mouth, is as ill a hearing as <a href="" id="lawfrench" class="annotBtn">Law-French</a>. Next to make them expert in the usefullest points of Grammar, and withall to season them, and win them early to the love of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> and true <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span>, ere any flattering seducement, or vain principle <span class="varspell" title="seize">seise</span> them wandering, some <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> and delightful Book of Education would be read to them; whereof the Greeks have store, as <a href="" id="cebes" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Cebes</span></a>, <span class="mi">Plutarch</span>, and other <a href="" id="socratic" class="annotBtn">Socratic</a> discourses. But in Latin we have none of classic authority extant, except the two or three first Books of <a href="" id="quintilian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Quintilian</span></a>, and some select pieces elsewhere. But here the main skill and groundwork will be, to <a href="" id="temper" class="annotBtn">temper</a> them such Lectures and Explanations upon every opportunity, as may lead and draw them in willing obedience, <span class="varspell" title="inflamed">enflam'd</span> with the <a href="" id="study" class="annotBtn">study</a> of Learning, and the admiration of <span class="varspell" title="Virtue">Vertue</span>; <span class="varspell" title="stirred">stirr'd</span> up with high hopes of living to be brave men, and worthy Patriots, dear to God, and famous to all ages. That they may despise and scorn all their childish, and ill-taught qualities, to delight in manly, and <a href="" id="liberall" class="annotBtn">liberall</a> Exercises: which he who hath the Art, and proper Eloquence to catch them with, what with mild and effectual perswasions, and what with the intimation of some fear, if need be, but chiefly by his own example, might in a short space gain them to an incredible diligence and courage: infusing into their young <span class="varspell" title="breasts">brests</span> such an ingenuous and noble ardor, as would not fail to make many of them renowned and matchless men. At the same time, some other hour of the day, might be taught them the rules of <span class="varspell" title="Arithmetic">Arithmetick</span>, and soon after the Elements of Geometry even playing, as the old manner was. After evening repast, till bed-time their thoughts will be best taken up in the <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> grounds of Religion, and the story of Scripture. The next step would be to the <a href="" id="agriculture" class="annotBtn">Authors of <span class="mi">Agriculture</span></a>, <span class="mi">Cato</span>, <span class="mi">Varro</span>, and <span class="mi">Columella</span>, for the matter is most <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span>, and if the language be difficult, so much the better, it is not a difficulty above their years. And here will be an occasion of inciting and <span class="varspell" title="enabling">inabling</span> them hereafter to improve the tillage of their Country, to recover the bad Soil, and to remedy the waste that is made of good: for this was one of <a href="" id="hercules" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Hercules's">Hercules</span></span></a> praises. Ere half these Authors be read (which will soon be with plying hard, and daily) they cannot <span class="varspell" title="choose">chuse</span> but be masters of any ordinary prose. So that it will be then seasonable for them to learn in any modern Author, the use of the Globes, and all the Maps; first with the old names, and then with the new: or they might be then capable to read any compendious method of <a href="" id="natural_philosophy" class="annotBtn">natural Philosophy</a>. And at the same time might be <span class="varspell" title="entering">entring</span> into the Greek tongue, after the same manner as was before <span class="varspell" title="prescribed">prescrib'd</span> in the Latin; whereby the difficulties of Grammar being soon overcome, all the <a href="" id="historical_physiology" class="annotBtn">Historical Physiology of <span class="mi">Aristotle</span></a> and <a href="" id="theophrastus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Theophrastus</span></a> are open before them, and as I may say, under contribution. The like access will be to <a href="" id="vitruvius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Vitruvius</span></a>, to <a href="" id="seneca" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Senecas</span> naturall questions,</a> to <a href="" id="mela" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Mela</span></a>, <a href="" id="celsus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Celsus</span></a>, <a href="" id="pliny" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Pliny</span></a>, or <a href="" id="solinus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Solinus</span></a>. And having thus <span class="varspell" title="passed">past</span> the principles of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Arithmetic">Arithmetick</span></span>, <span class="mi">Geometry</span>, <span class="mi">Astronomy</span>, and <span class="mi">Geography</span> with a general <a href="" id="compact" class="annotBtn">compact</a> of <span class="varspell" title="Physics">Physicks</span>, they may descend in <span class="mi">Mathematicks</span> to the instrumental science of <span class="mi">Trigonometry</span>, and from thence to Fortification, Architecture, <a href="" id="enginry" class="annotBtn">Enginry,</a> or Navigation. And in natural Philosophy they may proceed leisurely from the History of Meteors, Minerals, plants and living Creatures as far as Anatomy. Then also in course might be read to them out of some not tedious Writer the <a href="" id="physick" class="annotBtn">Institution of <span class="varspell" title="Physic">Physick</span></a>; that they may know <a href="" id="humors" class="annotBtn">the tempers, the <span class="varspell" title="humors">humours</span>, the seasons, </a>and how to manage a <a href="" id="crudity" class="annotBtn">crudity:</a> which he who can wisely and timely do, is not only a great <span class="varspell" title="Physician">Physitian</span> to himself, and to his friends, but also may at some time or other, save an Army by this frugal and expenseless means only; and not let the healthy and stout bodies of young men rot away under him for want of this discipline; which is a great pity, and no less a shame to the Commander. To set forward all these proceedings in Nature and <span class="mi">Mathematicks</span>, what hinders, but that they may procure, as oft as <span class="varspell" title="shall">shal</span> be needful, the helpful experiences of Hunters, Fowlers, Fishermen, Shepherds, Gardeners, Apothecaries; and in the other sciences, Architects, Engineers, Mariners, Anatomists; who doubtless would be ready some for reward, and some to <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> such a hopeful <a href="" id="seminary" class="annotBtn">Seminary</a>. And this will give them such a real tincture of natural knowledge, as they shall never forget, but daily augment with delight. Then also those Poets which are now counted most hard, will be both <span class="varspell" title="facile">facil</span> and pleasant, <a href="" id="orpheus2" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Orpheus</span></a>, <a href="" id="hesiod" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Hesiod</span></a>, <a href="" id="theocritus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Theocritus</span></a>, <a href="" id="aratus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Aratus</span></a>, <a href="" id="nicander" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Nicander</span></a>, <a href="" id="oppian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Oppian</span></a>, <a href="" id="dionysius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Dionysius</span></a>, and in Latin <a href="" id="lucretius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Lucretius</span></a>, <a href="" id="manilius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Manilius</span></a>, and the <a href="" id="rural_virgil" class="annotBtn">rural part of <span class="mi">Virgil</span></a>.
</p>
<p>
By this <a href="" id="time" class="annotBtn">time,</a> years and good general precepts will have <span class="varspell" title="furnished">furnisht</span> them more distinctly with that act of reason which in <span class="mi">Ethics</span> is <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> <a href="" id="proairesis" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Proairesis</span></a>: that they may with some judgement contemplate upon moral good and evil. Then will be <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> a special reinforcement of constant and sound <span class="varspell" title="indoctrinating">endoctrinating</span> to set them right and firm, instructing them more amply in the knowledge of <span class="varspell" title="Virtue">Vertue</span> and the hatred of Vice: while their young and pliant affections are led through all the <a href="" id="plato_xenophon" class="annotBtn">moral works of <span class="mi">Plato</span>, <span class="mi">Xenophon</span></a>, <span class="mi">Cicero</span>, <span class="mi">Plutarch</span>, <a href="" id="laertius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Laertius</span></a>, and those <a href="" id="locrian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Locrian</span> remnants</a>; but still to be <a href="" id="reduced" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="reduced">reduc't</span></a> in their nightward studies wherewith they close the <span class="varspell" title="day's">dayes</span> work, under the determinate sentence of <span class="mi">David</span> or <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Solomon">Salomon</span></span>, or the <span class="varspell" title="Evangelists">Evanges</span> and Apostolic Scriptures. Being perfect in the knowledge of personal duty, they may then begin the study of <a href="" id="economics" class="annotBtn">Economics</a>. And either now, or before this, they may have easily learnt at any odd hour the <span class="mi">Italian</span> Tongue. And soon after, but with wariness and good antidote, it would be <span class="varspell" title="wholesome">wholsome</span> enough to let them taste some choice Comedies, Greek, Latin, or <span class="mi">Italian</span>: Those Tragedies also that treat of <span class="varspell" title="Household">Houshold</span> matters, as <a href="" id="trachiniae" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Trachini&aelig;</span></a>, <a href="" id="alcestis" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Alcestis</span></a>, and the like. The next remove must be to the study of <span class="mi">Politicks</span>; to know the beginning, end, and reasons of Political Societies; that they may not in a dangerous fit of the <span class="varspell" title="Commonwealth">Common-wealth</span> be such poor, shaken, uncertain Reeds, of such a tottering Conscience, as many of our great Counsellers have lately <span class="varspell" title="shown">shewn</span> themselves, but <span class="varspell" title="steadfast">stedfast</span> pillars of the State. After this they are to dive into the grounds of Law, and legal Justice; <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliver'd</span> first, and with best warrant by <a href="" id="moses" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Moses</span></a>; and as far as <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> prudence can be trusted, in those <span class="varspell" title="extolled">extoll'd</span> remains of Grecian Law-givers, <a href="" id="lycurgus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Lycurgus">Licurgus</span></span></a>, <a href="" id="solon" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Solon</span></a>, <a href="" id="zaleucus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Zaleucus</span></a>, <a href="" id="charondas" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Charondas</span></a>, and thence to all the Roman <span class="mi">Edicts</span> and Tables with their <a href="" id="justinian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Justinian</span></a>; and so down to the <span class="mi">Saxon</span> and common Laws of <span class="mi">England</span>, and the Statutes. <span class="varspell" title="Sundays">Sundayes</span> also and every evening may be now understandingly spent in the highest matters of <span class="mi">Theology</span>, and Church History ancient and modern: and ere this time the Hebrew Tongue at a set hour might have been <span class="varspell" title="gained">gain'd</span>, that the Scriptures may be now read in their own original; whereto it would be no impossibility to add the <a href="" id="chaldee" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Chaldey</span></a>, and the <a href="" id="syrian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Syrian</span></a> Dialect. When all these employments are well <span class="varspell" title="conquered">conquer'd</span>, then will the <span class="varspell" title="choice">choise</span> Histories, <span class="mi">Heroic</span> <span class="mi">Poems</span>, and <a href="" id="attic" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Attic</span></a> Tragedies of stateliest and most regal argument, with all the famous Political Orations offer themselves; which if they were not only read; but some of them got by memory, and solemnly <span class="varspell" title="pronounced">pronounc't</span> with right accent, and grace, as might be taught, would endue them even with the spirit and vigor of <a href="" id="demosthenes" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Demosthenes</span></a> or <a href="" id="cicero" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Cicero</span></a>, <a href="" id="euripides" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Euripides</span></a>, or <a href="" id="sophocles" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Sophocles</span></a>. And now lastly will be the time to read with them those <a href="" id="organic_arts" class="annotBtn">organic arts</a> which <span class="varspell" title="enable">inable</span> men to discourse and write perspicuously, elegantly, and according to the <a href="" id="fitted" class="annotBtn">fitted</a> <span class="varspell" title="style">stile</span> of lofty, mean, or lowly. Logic therefore so much as is useful, is to be <span class="varspell" title="referred">referr'd</span> to this due place withall her <a href="" id="well_coucht" class="annotBtn">well <span class="varspell" title="couched">coucht</span> Heads</a> and <a href="" id="topics" class="annotBtn">Topics,</a> <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> it be time to open <a href="" id="palm" class="annotBtn">her contracted palm</a> into a <span class="varspell" title="graceful">gracefull</span> and ornate <span class="varspell" title="Rhetoric">Rhetorick</span> taught out of the rule of <a href="" id="plato" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Plato</span></a>, <a href="" id="aristotle" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Aristotle</span></a>, <a href="" id="phalereus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Phalereus</span></a>, <a href="" id="cicero2" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Cicero</span></a>, <a href="" id="hermogenes" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Hermogenes</span></a>, <a href="" id="longinus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Longinus</span></a>. To which Poetry would be made subsequent, or indeed rather precedent, as being <a href="" id="subtle" class="annotBtn">less <span class="varspell" title="subtle">suttle</span></a> and fine, but more simple, sensuous and passionate. I mean not here the prosody of a verse, which they could not but have hit on before among the rudiments of Grammar; but that sublime Art which in <a href="" id="poetics" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Aristotle's">Aristotles</span></span> <span class="mi">Poetics</span></a>, in <a href="" id="horace" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Horace</span></a>, and the <span class="mi">Italian</span> Commentaries of <a href="" id="castelvetro" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Castelvetro</span></a>, <a href="" id="tasso" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Tasso</span></a>, <a href="" id="mazzoni" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Mazzoni</span></a>, and others, teaches what the laws are of a true <span class="mi">Epic</span> Poem, what of a <span class="mi">Dramatic</span>, what of a <span class="mi">Lyric</span>, what <a href="" id="decorum" class="annotBtn">Decorum</a> is, which is the grand master-piece to observe. This would make them soon perceive what despicable creatures our <a href="" id="common" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="common">comm</span></a> Rimers and <a href="" id="play_writers" class="annotBtn">Play-writers</a> be, and <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> them, what religious, what glorious and magnificent use might be made of Poetry both in divine and <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> things. From hence and not till now will be the right season of forming them to be able Writers and Composers in every excellent matter, when they shall be thus <a href="" id="fraught" class="annotBtn">fraught</a> with an universal insight into things. Or whether they be to speak in Parliament or <span class="varspell" title="Council">Counsel</span>, <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> and attention would be waiting on their lips. There would then also appear in Pulpits other Visages, other gestures, and stuff otherwise wrought then what we now sit under, oft times to as great a trial of our patience as any other that they preach to us. These are the Studies wherein our noble and our gentle Youth ought to bestow their time in a disciplinary way from twelve to one and twenty; unless they rely more upon their ancestors dead, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> upon themselves living. In which methodical course it is so <span class="varspell" title="supposed">suppos'd</span> they must proceed by the <span class="varspell" title="steady">steddy</span> pace of learning onward, as at convenient times for <span class="varspell" title="memory's">memories</span> sake to retire back into the <a href="" id="middle_ward" class="annotBtn">middle ward,</a> and sometimes into the rear of what they have been taught, untill they have <span class="varspell" title="confimed">confirm'd</span>, and solidly united the whole body of their <a href="" id="perfeted" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="perfected">perfeted</span></a> knowledge, like the last <span class="varspell" title="embattling">embattelling</span> of a Roman Legion. Now will be worth the seeing what Exercises and Recreations may best agree, and become these Studies.

<br />
<h3 class="msubsubhead">Their Exercise.</h3>

<p class="first">
The course of Study hitherto briefly <span class="varspell" title="described">describ'd</span>, is, what I can guess by reading, likest to those ancient and famous <a href="" id="schools" class="annotBtn">Schools of <span class="mi">Pythagoras</span>, <span class="mi">Plato</span>, <span class="mi">Isocrates</span>, <span class="mi">Aristotle</span></a> and such others, out of which were bred up such a number of renowned Philosophers, Orators, Historians, Poets and Princes all over <span class="mi">Greece</span>, <span class="mi">Italy</span>, and <span class="mi">Asia</span>, besides the flourishing <a href="" id="studies" class="annotBtn">Studies of <span class="mi">Cyrene</span> and <span class="mi">Alexandria</span></a>. But herein it shall exceed them, and supply a defect as great as that which <a href="" id="sparta" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Plato</span> noted in the <span class="varspell" title="Commonwealth">Common-wealth</span> of <span class="mi">Sparta</span></a>; whereas that City <span class="varspell" title="trained">train'd</span> up their Youth most for War, and these in their Academies and <span class="mi">Lyc&aelig;um</span>, all for the Gown, this institution of breeding which I here delineate, shall be equally good both for Peace and War. Therefore about an hour and a half ere they eat at Noon should be <span class="varspell" title="allowed">allow'd</span> them for exercise and due rest afterwards: But the time for this may be <span class="varspell" title="enlarged">enlarg'd</span> at pleasure, according as their rising in the morning shall be early. The Exercise which I commend first, is the exact use of their <a href="" id="weapon" class="annotBtn">Weapon,</a> to guard and to strike safely with edge, or point; this will keep them healthy, nimble, strong, and well in breath, is also the likeliest means to make them grow large and tall, and to inspire them with a gallant and fearless courage, which being <span class="varspell" title="tempered">temper'd</span> with seasonable Lectures and Precepts to them of true Fortitude and Patience, will turn into a native and <span class="varspell" title="heroic">heroick</span> <span class="varspell" title="valor">valour</span>, and make them hate the <span class="varspell" title="cowardice">cowardise</span> of doing wrong. They must be also <span class="varspell" title="practiced">practiz'd</span> in all the Locks and <span class="varspell" title="grips">Gripes</span> of <span class="varspell" title="wrestling">Wrastling</span>, wherein English men were wont to <span class="varspell" title="excel">excell</span>, as need may often be in fight to <span class="varspell" title="tug">tugg</span> or grapple, and to close. And this perhaps will be enough, wherein to <a href="" id="prove_heat" class="annotBtn">prove and heat</a> their single strength. The interim of unsweating themselves regularly, and convenient rest before meat may both with profit and delight be taken up in recreating and composing their <span class="varspell" title="travailed">travail'd</span> spirits with the solemn and divine harmonies of <span class="varspell" title="Music">Musick</span> heard or <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span>; either while the <span class="varspell" title="skillful">skilful</span> <span class="mi">Organist</span> plies his grave and fancied descant, in lofty fugues, or the whole Symphony with artful and unimaginable touches adorn and grace the well studied chords of some choice Composer; sometimes the Lute, or soft Organ stop waiting on elegant Voices either to Religious, martial, or civil Ditties; which if wise men and Prophets be not <span class="varspell" title="extremely">extreamly</span> <a href="" id="out" class="annotBtn">out,</a> have a great power over dispositions and manners, to smooth and make them gentle from <span class="varspell" title="rustic">rustick</span> harshness and <span class="varspell" title="distempered">distemper'd</span> <a href="" id="passions" class="annotBtn">passions</a>. The like also would not be unexpedient after Meat to assist and cherish Nature in her first <a href="" id="concoction" class="annotBtn">concoction,</a> and send their minds back to study in good tune and satisfaction. Where having <span class="varspell" title="followed">follow'd</span> it close under vigilant eyes till about two hours before supper, they are by a sudden <span class="varspell" title="alarm">alarum</span> or watch word, to be <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> out to their military motions, under <a href="" id="skie" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="sky">skie</span> or covert,</a> according to the season, as was the Roman wont; first on foot, then as their age permits, on Horseback, to all the Art of Cavalry; That having in sport, but with much exactness, and <a href="" id="muster" class="annotBtn">daily muster</a>, <span class="varspell" title="served">serv'd</span> out the rudiments of their <span class="varspell" title="Soldiership">Souldiership</span> in all the skill of <a href="" id="embattelling" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Embattling">Embattelling</span></a>, Marching, Encamping, Fortifying, Besieging and Battering, with all the helps of ancient and modern stratagems, <span class="mi">Tacticks</span> and warlike maxims, they may as it were out of a long War come forth renowned and perfect Commanders in the service of their Country. They would not then, if they were trusted with fair and hopeful armies, suffer them for want of just and wise discipline to shed away from about them like <a href="" id="sick_feathers" class="annotBtn">sick feathers,</a> though they be never so oft <span class="varspell" title="supplied">suppli'd</span>: they would not suffer their empty and <a href="" id="unrecruitible" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="unrecruitable">unrecrutible</span></a> Colonels of twenty men in a Company to quaff out, or convey into secret hoards, the wages of a <a href="" id="delusive" class="annotBtn">delusive</a> list, and a miserable remnant: yet in the mean while to be <span class="varspell" title="overmastered">over-master'd</span> with a score or two of drunkards, the only <span class="varspell" title="soldiery">souldery</span> left about them, or else to comply with all rapines and violences. No certainly, if they knew ought of that knowledge that belongs to good men or good <span class="varspell" title="Governors">Governours</span>, they would not suffer these things. But to return to our own institute, besides these constant exercises at home, there is another opportunity of gaining experience to be won from pleasure it self abroad; In those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against nature not to go out, and see her riches, and partake in her <span class="varspell" title="rejoicing">rejoycing</span> with Heaven and Earth. I should not therefore be a <span class="varspell" title="persuader">perswader</span> to them of studying much then, after two or three year that they have well laid their grounds, but to ride out in Companies with prudent and staid Guides, to all the quarters of the Land: learning and observing all places of strength, all <a href="" id="commodities" class="annotBtn">commodities</a> of building and of soil, for Towns and Tillage, <span class="varspell" title="Harbors">Harbours</span> and Ports for Trade. Sometimes taking Sea as far as to our Navy, to learn there also what they can in the practical knowledge of sailing and of Sea-fight. These ways would try all their peculiar gifts of Nature, and if there were any secret excellence among them, would fetch it out, and give it fair opportunities to advance it self by, which could not but mightily redound to the good of this Nation, and bring into fashion again those old admired <span class="varspell" title="Virtues">Vertues</span> and Excellencies, with far more advantage now in this purity of Christian knowledge. Nor shall we then need the <a href="" id="paris" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Monsieurs</span> of <span class="mi">Paris</span></a> to take our <span class="varspell" title="hopeful">hopefull</span> Youth into their slight and prodigal custodies and send them over back again <span class="varspell" title="transformed">transform'd</span> into Mimicks, Apes, and <a href="" id="kickshoes" class="annotBtn">Kicshoes</a>. But if they desire to see other Countries at three or four and twenty years of age, not to learn Principles but to enlarge Experience, and make wise observation, they will by that time be such as shall deserve the regard and <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> of all men where they pass, and the society and friendship of those in all places who are best and most eminent. And perhaps then other Nations will be glad to visit us for their Breeding, or else to imitate us in their own Country.
</p>
<p>
Now lastly for their Diet there cannot be much to say, save only that it would be best in the same House; for much time else would be lost abroad, and many ill habits got; and that it should be plain, healthful, and moderate I suppose is out of <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span>. Thus Mr. <span class="mi">Hartlib</span>, you have a general view in writing, as your desire was, of that which at several times I had <span class="varspell" title="discoursed">discourst</span> with you concerning the best and Noblest way of Education; not beginning, as some have done from the Cradle, which yet might be worth many considerations, if brevity had not been my scope, many other circumstances also I could have <span class="varspell" title="mentioned">mention'd</span>, but this to such as have the worth in them to make trial, for light and direction may be enough. Only I believe that this is not a Bow for every man to shoot in that counts himself a Teacher; but will require sinews almost equal to those which <span class="mi">Homer</span> gave <a href="" id="ulysses" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ulysses</span></a>, yet I am withall <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> that it may prove much more <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> in the assay, then it now seems at distance, and much more illustrious: howbeit not more difficult <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> I imagine, and that imagination presents me with nothing but very happy and very possible according to best wishes; if God have so decreed, and this age have spirit and capacity enough to apprehend.
