<p class="first">




<span class="varspell" title="In"><span class="minitial">I</span></span>n


the publishing of <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span>, which for the most part <span class="varspell" title="aim">aime</span> not beyond the good of <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> society,
to set them barely forth to the people without reason or Preface, like a <span class="varspell" title="physical">physicall</span> <a href="" id="prescript" class="annotBtn">prescript</a>, or
only with <span class="varspell" title="threatenings">threatnings</span>, as it were a lordly command, in the <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> of <span
class="mi">Plato</span> was


thought to be done neither generously nor wisely. His advice was, seeing that


persuasion certainly is a more winning, and more manlike way to <span class="varspell" title="keep">keepe</span> men in


obedience <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span>, that to such <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span> as were of <span class="varspell" title="principal">principall</span> moment, there


should be <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> as an induction, some well <span class="varspell" title="tempered">temper'd</span> discourse, <span class="varspell" title="showing">shewing</span> how good,


how <span class="varspell" title="gainful">gainfull</span>, how happy it must needs be to live according to honesty and


justice, which being <span class="varspell" title="uttered">utter'd</span> with those native <span class="varspell" title="colors">colours</span> and graces of speech, as


true eloquence the daughter of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> can best bestow upon her <span class="varspell" title="mother's">mothers</span> praises,


would so incite, and in a manner, <span class="varspell" title="charm">charme</span> the multitude into the love of that


which is really good, as to <span class="varspell" title="embrace">imbrace</span> it ever after, not of <span class="varspell" title="custom">custome</span> and awe, which


most men do, but of choice and purpose, with true and constant delight. But this


practice we may learn, from a better &amp; more ancient authority, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any heathen


writer <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> to give us, and indeed being a point of so high <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> &amp; worth, how


could it be but we should find it in that book, within whose sacred context all


<span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> is <span class="varspell" title="enfolded">infolded</span>? <a name="moses"><span class="mi">Moses</span></a> therefore the only Lawgiver
that we can believe to have <span class="varspell" title="been">beene</span> visibly taught of God, knowing how <span class="varspell" title="vain">vaine</span> it was to write <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span> to


men whose hearts were not first <span class="varspell" title="seasoned">season'd</span> with the knowledge of God and of his


<span class="varspell" title="works">workes</span>, began from the book of Genesis, as a prologue to his <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span>; which


<span class="mi"><a href="" id="Josephus" class="annotBtn">Josephus</a></span> right well <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> noted. That the nation of the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span>, reading


therein the <span class="varspell" title="universal">universall</span> <span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnesse</span> of God to all creatures in the Creation, and his


peculiar <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> to them in his election of <span class="mi">Abraham</span> their ancestor, from


whom they could derive so many blessings upon themselves, might be <span class="varspell" title="moved">mov'd</span> to obey

sincerely by knowing so good a


reason of their obedience. If then in the administration of <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> justice, and


under the obscurity of <span class="varspell" title="Ceremonial">Ceremoniall</span> rites, such care was had by the wisest of the


heathen, and by <span class="mi">Moses</span> among the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span>, to instruct them at least in a


<span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> reason of that government to which their subjection was <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span>, how


much more ought the members of the Church under the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> <span class="varspell" title="seek">seeke</span> to <span class="varspell" title="inform"></span>


their understanding in the reason of that government which the Church <span class="varspell" title="claims">claimes</span> to


have over them: especially for that the Church <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> in her immediate cure those


inner parts and affections of the mind where the seat of reason is; having power


to examine our <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span> knowledge, and to demand from us in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> <span class="varspell" title="behalf">behalfe</span> a


service <span class="varspell" title="entirely">intirely</span> reasonable. But because about the manner and order of this


government, whether it ought to be <a href="" id="Presbyteriall" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Presbyterial">Presbyteriall</span></a>, or <a href="" id="Prelaticall" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Prelatical">Prelaticall</span></a>, such <span class="varspell" title="endless">endlesse</span>


question, or rather <span class="varspell" title="uproar">uproare</span> is arisen in this land, as may be justly <span class="varspell" title="termed">term'd</span>, what


the <span class="varspell" title="fever">feaver</span> is to the <span class="varspell" title="Physicians">Physitians</span>, the <span class="varspell" title="eternal">eternall</span> reproach of our Divines; <span class="varspell" title="whilst">whilest</span>


other profound Clerks of late greatly, as they conceive, to the advancement of


Prelaty, are so earnestly meting out the Lydian proconsular <a href="" id="Asia" class="annotBtn">Asia</a>, to


make good the prime metropolis of <a href="" id="Ephesus" class="annotBtn">Ephesus</a>, as if some of our Prelates in all


haste meant to change their <span class="varspell" title="soil">soile</span>, and become <span class="varspell" title="neighbors">neighbours</span> to the English Bishop of


<a href="" id="Chalcedon" class="annotBtn">Chalcedon</a>; and <span class="varspell" title="whilst">whilest</span> good <a href="" id="Breerwood" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Breerwood</span></a> as busily <span class="varspell" title="bestirs">bestirres</span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> in our


vulgar tongue to divide precisely the three <span class="varspell" title="Patriarchates">Patriarchats</span>, of Rome, Alexandria,


and Antioch, and whether to any of these England <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> belong, I shall in the


<span class="varspell" title="meanwhile">meane while</span> not cease to hope through the mercy and grace of Christ, the head and


husband of his <a href="" id="Church" class="annotBtn">Church</a>, that England shortly is to belong, neither to See


<span class="varspell" title="Patriarchal">Patriarchall</span>, nor See <span class="varspell" title="Prelatical">Prelaticall</span>, but to the <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> feeding and disciplining


of that <span class="varspell" title="ministerial">ministeriall</span> order, which the blessed Apostles constituted throughout the


Churches: and this I shall assay to prove can be no other, <span title="than">then</span> that of


Presbyters and Deacons. And if any man incline to <span class="varspell" title="think">thinke</span> I undertake a <span class="varspell" title="task">taske</span> too


difficult for <a href="" id="age" class="annotBtn">my <span class="varspell" title="years">yeares</span></a>, I trust through the supreme <span class="varspell" title="enlightening">inlightning</span> assistance <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span>


otherwise; for my <span class="varspell" title="years">yeares</span>, be they few or many, what <span class="varspell" title="emports">imports</span> it? So they bring


reason, let that be <span class="varspell" title="looked">lookt</span> on: and for the task, from hence that the question in


hand is so <span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span> to be known at this time chiefly by every meaner capacity,


and <span class="varspell" title="contains">containes</span> in it the explication of many admirable and heavenly privileges


<span class="varspell" title="reached">reacht</span> out to us by the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>, I conclude the task must be <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span>. God having to


this end <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span> his <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> to be the revelation of his power and <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> in


Christ Jesus. And this is one depth of his <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span>, that he could so plainly


<span class="varspell" title="reveal">reveale</span> so great a measure of it to the <span class="varspell" title="gross">grosse</span> distorted apprehension of <span class="varspell" title="decayed">decay'd</span>


<span class="varspell" title="mankind">mankinde</span>. Let others therefore dread and shun the Scriptures for their <span class="varspell" title="darkness">darknesse</span>,


I shall wish I may deserve to be <span class="varspell" title="reckoned">reckon'd</span> among those who admire and dwell upon


them for their <span class="varspell" title="clearness">clearnesse</span>. And this <span class="varspell" title="seems">seemes</span> to be the cause why in those places of


holy writ, wherein is treated of Church-government, the reasons thereof are not


formally, and <span class="varspell" title="professedly">profestly</span> set <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span>, because to him that heeds attentively the


drift and scope of Christian profession, they easily imply themselves, which


thing further to <span class="varspell" title="explain">explane</span>, having now <span class="varspell" title="prefaced">prefac'd</span> enough, I shall no longer <span class="varspell" title="defer">deferre</span>.

<span class="msummary">That Church-<span class="varspell" title="government">governement</span> is <span class="varspell" title="prescribed">prescrib'd</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>, and that to say
otherwise
is unsound.</span></p>


<p class="first">


<span class="varspell" title="The"><span class="minitial">T</span></span>he first and


greatest reason of Church-government, we may securely with the assent of many on


the adverse part, <span class="varspell" title="affirm">affirme</span> to be, because we <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> it so <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span> and set out to


us by the appointment of God in the Scriptures; but whether this be


<span class="varspell" title="Presbyterial">Presbyteriall</span>, or <span class="varspell" title="Prelatical">Prelaticall</span>, it cannot be brought to the <a href="" id="scanning" class="annotBtn">scanning</a>, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> I


have said what is meet to some who do not think it for the ease of their


inconsequent opinions, to grant that Church discipline is <span class="varspell" title="platformed">platform'd</span> in the


Bible, but that it is left to the discretion of men. To this conceit of theirs I


answer, that it is both unsound and untrue. For there is not that thing in the


world of more grave and urgent importance throughout the whole life of man, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>


is discipline. What need I instance? He that <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> read with <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span>, of


Nations and Commonwealths, of Cities and Camps, of peace and <span class="varspell" title="war">warre</span>, sea and land,


will readily agree that the flourishing and decaying of all <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> societies, all


the moments and turnings of <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> occasions are <span class="varspell" title="moved">mov'd</span> to and fro as upon the


axle of discipline. So that whatsoever power or sway in <span class="varspell" title="mortal">mortall</span> things weaker men


have attributed to fortune, I <span class="varspell" title="do">durst</span> with more confidence (the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> of divine


providence ever <span class="varspell" title="saved">sav'd</span>) ascribe either to the vigor, or the <span class="varspell" title="slackness">slacknesse</span> of


discipline. Nor is there any sociable perfection in this life <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> or sacred


that can be above discipline, but she is that which with her <span class="varspell" title="musical">musicall</span> cords


preserves and holds all the parts thereof together. Hence in those perfect armies


of <span class="mi">Cyrus</span> in <a href="" id="Xenophon" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Xenophon,</span></a> and <a href="" id="scipio" class="annotBtn"><span
class="mi">Scipio</span></a> in the Roman stories, the


excellence of military skill was <span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteem'd</span>, not by the not needing, but by the


readiest submitting to the edicts of their commander. And certainly discipline is


not only the <span class="varspell" title="removal">removall</span> of disorder, but if any visible shape can be given to


divine things, the very visible shape and image of <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, whereby she is not


only <span class="varspell" title="seen">seene</span> in the regular gestures and motions of her heavenly paces as she


<span class="varspell" title="walks">walkes</span>, but also makes the harmony of her voice audible to <span class="varspell" title="mortal">mortall</span> <span class="varspell" title="ears">eares</span>. Yea the


Angels themselves, in whom no disorder is <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, as the Apostle that saw them in


his rapture describes, are <span class="varspell" title="distinguished">distinguisht</span> and <a href="" id="quaterniond" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="quaternioned">quaterniond</span></a> into their <span class="varspell" title="celestial">celestiall</span>


<span class="varspell" title="Princedoms">Princedomes</span>, and <a href="" id="Satrapies" class="annotBtn">Satrapies</a>, according as God <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="written">writ</span> his <span class="varspell" title="imperial">imperiall</span>


decrees through the great provinces of <span class="varspell" title="heaven">heav'n</span>. The state also of the blessed in


Paradise, though never so perfect, is not therefore left without discipline,


whose golden <span class="varspell" title="surveying">survaying</span> reed marks out and measures every quarter and circuit of


new Jerusalem. Yet is it not to be <span class="varspell" title="conceived">conceiv'd</span> that those <span class="varspell" title="eternal">eternall</span> effluences of


sanctity and love in the glorified Saints should by this <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> be <span class="varspell" title="confined">confin'd</span> and


<span class="varspell" title="cloyed">cloy'd</span> with repetition of that which is <span class="varspell" title="prescribed">prescrib'd</span>, but that our <span class="varspell" title="happiness">happinesse</span> may


<a href="" id="orbe" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="orb">orbe</span></a> <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> into a thousand <a href="" id="vagancy" class="annotBtn">vagancies</a> of glory and delight, and with a <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of


<span class="varspell" title="eccentric">eccentricall</span> equation be as it were an invariable Planet of joy and felicity, how


much <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> can we believe that God would leave his <span class="varspell" title="frail">fraile</span> and feeble, though not


<span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> beloved Church here below to the <span class="varspell" title="perpetual">perpetuall</span> stumble of conjecture and


disturbance in this our <span class="varspell" title="dark">darke</span> voyage without the card and <span class="varspell" title="compass">compasse</span> of Discipline.


Which is so hard to be of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> making, that we may see even in the guidance of a


<span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> state to worldly <span class="varspell" title="happiness">happinesse</span>, it is not for every learned, or every wise


man, though many of them consult in common, to invent or frame a discipline, but


if it be at all the <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> of man, it must be of such a one as is a true knower of


<span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> in whom contemplation and practice, wit, prudence,


fortitude, and eloquence must be rarely met, both to comprehend the hidden causes


of things, and span in his thoughts all the various effects that passion or


complexion can <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> in <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> nature; and hereto must his hand be at defiance with


<span class="varspell" title="gain">gaine</span>, and his heart in all <span class="varspell" title="virtues">vertues</span> <span class="varspell" title="heroic">heroick</span>. So far is it from the <span class="varspell" title="ken">kenne</span> of these


wretched projectors of ours that <span class="varspell" title="bescrawl">bescraull</span> their <span class="varspell" title="Pamphlets">Pamflets</span> every day with new


<span class="varspell" title="forms">formes</span> of government for our Church. And therefore all the ancient lawgivers were


either truly <span class="varspell" title="inspired">inspir'd</span> as <span class="mi">Moses,</span> or were such men as with authority <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>


might give it out to be so, as <span class="mi"><a href="" id="Minos" class="annotBtn">Minos</a>, <a href="" id="Lycurgus" class="annotBtn">Lycurgus</a>, <a href="" id="Numa" class="annotBtn">Numa</a>,</span> because they wisely


forethought that men would never quietly submit to such a discipline as had not


more of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> hand in it <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span>. To come within the <span class="varspell" title="narrowness">narrownesse</span> of <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span>


government, observation will <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us many <span class="varspell" title="deep">deepe</span> <span class="varspell" title="counselors">counsellers</span> of state and judges


to demean themselves incorruptly in the <span class="varspell" title="settled">setl'd</span> course of <span class="varspell" title="affairs">affaires</span>, and many


worthy Preachers upright in their lives, <span class="varspell" title="powerful">powerfull</span> in their audience; but look


upon either of these men where they are left to their own disciplining at home,


and you shall <span class="varspell" title="soon">soone</span> perceive for all their single knowledge and <span class="varspell" title="uprightness">uprightnesse</span>, how


deficient they are in the regulating of their own family; not only in what may


<span class="varspell" title="concern">concerne</span> the <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> and decent composure of their minds in their <span class="varspell" title="several">severall</span>


places, but that which is of a lower and easier performance, the right possessing


of the outward <span class="varspell" title="vessel">vessell</span>, their body, in health or <span class="varspell" title="sickness">sicknesse</span>, rest or <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span>, diet,


or abstinence, whereby to render it more pliant to the <span title="soul" class="varspell">soule</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="useful">usefull</span> to the


<span class="varspell" title="Commonwealth">Common-wealth</span>: which if men were but as good to discipline themselves, as some are


to tutor their Horses and Hawks, it could not be so <span class="varspell" title="gross">grosse</span> in most <span class="varspell" title="households">housholds</span>. If


then it appear so hard and so little <span class="varspell" title="known">knowne</span>, how to <span class="varspell" title="govern">governe</span> a house well, which


is thought of so <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> discharge, and for every <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> undertaking, what skill of


man, what <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span>, what parts, can be sufficient to give <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span> &amp; ordinances to


the elect <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> of God? If we could imagine that he had left it at <span class="varspell" title="random">randome</span>


without his provident and gracious ordering, who is he so arrogant so


presumptuous that durst dispose and guide the living <span class="varspell" title="ark">arke</span> of the holy Ghost,


though he should <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> it <span class="varspell" title="wandering">wandring</span> in the field of <span class="mi"><a href="" id="Bethshemesh" class="annotBtn">Bethshemesh</a>,</span> without


the conscious warrant of some high calling. But no profane insolence can <span class="varspell" title="parallel">paralell</span>


that which our Prelates dare avouch, to drive <span class="varspell" title="outrageously">outragiously</span>, and shatter the holy


<span class="varspell" title="ark">arke</span> of the Church, not born upon their shoulders with pains and <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> in the


word, but <span class="varspell" title="drawn">drawne</span> with rude oxen their officials, and their <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> brute inventions.


Let them make <span class="varspell" title="shows">shewes</span> of reforming while they will, so long as the Church is

&amp;


set prescriptions of baths, &amp; odors, which may render her at last the more


amiable to his eye. For of any age or sex, most unfitly may a virgin be left to


an <span class="varspell" title="uncertain">uncertaine</span> and arbitrary education. Yea though she be well instructed, yet is


she still under a more strait tuition, especially if <span class="varspell" title="betrothed">betroth'd</span>. In like manner


the Church bearing the same resemblance, it were not reason to think she should


be left destitute of that care which is as necessary, and proper to her, as


instruction. For <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> preaching indeed is the gift of the Spirit working as


best <span class="varspell" title="seems">seemes</span> to his secret will, but discipline is the <span class="varspell" title="practical">practick</span> work of preaching


directed and <span class="varspell" title="applied">apply'd</span> as is most requisite to particular duty; without which it


were all one to the benefit of souls, as it would be to the cure of bodies, if


all the <span class="varspell" title="Physicians">Physitians</span> in London should get into the <span class="varspell" title="several">severall</span> Pulpits of the City,


and assembling all the diseased in every parish should begin a learned Lecture of


Pleurisies, Palsies, Lethargies, to which perhaps none there present were


<span class="varspell" title="inclined">inclin'd</span>, and so without so much as feeling one <span class="varspell" title="pulse">puls</span>, or giving the least order


to any <span class="varspell" title="skillful">skilfull</span> Apothecary, should <span class="varspell" title="dismiss">dismisse</span> <span class="varspell" title="them">'em</span> from time to time, some groaning,


some languishing, some expiring, with this only charge to look well to


themselves, and do as they <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span>. Of what excellence and necessity then


Church-discipline is, how beyond the faculty of man to frame, and how dangerous


to be left to <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> invention who would be every foot turning it to sinister ends,


how properly also it is the <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> of God as father, and of Christ as Husband of


the Church; we have by thus much heard.

the hearts of the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span> from their old law to expect a new and more perfect

And that this indeed God <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> done for us in the Gospel we shall see with open

erected then all the magnificence of Temple or Tabernacle, such a heavenly


structure of <span class="varspell" title="evangelic">evangelick</span> discipline so diffusive of knowledge and charity to the

elegant and <span class="varspell" title="artful">artfull</span> symmetry of the promised new temple in <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Ezekial">Ezekiel</span>,</span> and


all those sumptuous things under the Law were made to <span class="varspell" title="signify">signifie</span> the inward beauty


and splendor of the Christian Church thus <span class="varspell" title="governed">govern'd</span>. And whether this be commanded


let it now be <span class="varspell" title="judged">judg'd</span>. <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span> after his preface to <a href="" id="1timothy" class="annotBtn">the first of <span class="mi">Timothy</span></a> which <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> concludes in the 17 Verse with Amen, enters upon the


subject of his Epistle which is to establish the Church-government with a


command. This charge I commit to <span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span> son <span class="mi">Timothy:</span> according to the


prophecies which went before on <span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span>, that <span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span> by them <span class="varspell" title="might">might'st</span> war a good


warfare. Which is plain enough thus expounded. This charge I commit to <span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span>


wherein I now go about to instruct <span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span> how <span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span> <span class="varspell" title="shall">shalt</span> set up Church-discipline,


that <span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span> <span class="varspell" title="might">might'st</span> <span class="varspell" title="war">warre</span> a good warfare, bearing <span class="varspell" title="yourself">thy selfe</span> constantly and


faithfully in the <span class="varspell" title="Ministry">Ministery</span>, which in the I to the <a href="" id="Corinthians" class="annotBtn">Corinthians</a> is also <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> a


warfare: and so after a <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of Parenthesis concerning <a href="" id="hymenaeus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Hymen&aelig;us</span></a> he


<span class="varspell" title="returns">returnes</span> to his command though under the <span class="varspell" title="mild">milde</span> word of exhorting, <span title="Chapter" class="varspell">Cap</span>.2.v.I. I


exhort therefore. As if he had interrupted his former command by the <span class="varspell" title="occasional">occasionall</span>


mention of <span class="mi">Hymenaeus</span>. More beneath in the <a href="" id="verse14" class="annotBtn">14 <span class="varspell" title="Verse">V.</span> of the 3 <span class="varspell" title="Chapter">C.</span></a> when he <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span>
<span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliver'd</span> the duties of Bishops or Presbyters and Deacons not once naming any other order


in the Church, he thus <span class="varspell" title="adds">addes</span>. These things write I unto <span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span> hoping to come unto


<span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span> shortly (such necessity it seems there was) but if I tarry long, that <span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span>


<span class="varspell" title="mayest">mai'st</span> know how <span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span> <span class="varspell" title="ought">ought'st</span> to behave <span class="varspell" title="yourself">thy selfe</span> in the house of God. From this


place it may be justly <span class="varspell" title="asked">ask't</span>, whether <span class="mi">Timothy</span> by this here written might


know what was to be <span class="varspell" title="known">knowne</span> concerning the orders of Church <span class="varspell" title="governors">governours</span> or no? If


he might, then in such a <span class="varspell" title="clear">cleere</span> text as this may we know too without further <a href="" id="jangle" class="annotBtn">jangle</a>;


if he might not, then did <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span> write insufficiently, and moreover said


not true, for he <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> here he might know, and I <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> <span class="varspell" title="myself">my selfe</span> he did know


ere this was written, but that the Apostle had more regard to the instruction of


us, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to the informing of him. In the fifth <span class="varspell" title="Chapter">Chap.</span> after some other Church


precepts concerning discipline, mark what a <span class="varspell" title="dreadful">dreadfull</span> command <span class="varspell" title="follows">followes</span>, <a href="" id="21" class="annotBtn">Verse 21</a>.


I charge <span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span> before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that


<span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span> observe these things, and as if all were not yet sure <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, he closes up


the Epistle with an adjuring charge thus. I give <span class="varspell" title="you">thee</span> charge in the sight of God


who <span class="varspell" title="quickens">quickneth</span> all things, and before Christ Jesus, that <span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span> <span class="varspell" title="keep">keepe</span> this


<span class="varspell" title="commandment">commandement</span>: that is the whole <span class="varspell" title="commandment">commandement</span> concerning discipline, being the


<span class="varspell" title="main">maine</span> purpose of the Epistle: although <a href="" id="Hooker" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Hooker</span></a> would <span class="varspell" title="fain">faine</span> have this


denouncement <span class="varspell" title="referred"><span class="varspell" title="referred">referr'd</span></span> to the particular precept going before, because the word


<span class="varspell" title="Commandment">Commandement</span> is in the <a href="" id="singular" class="annotBtn">singular</a> number, not <span class="varspell" title="remembering">remembring</span> that even in the first


<span class="varspell" title="Chapter">Chapt.</span> of this Epistle, the word <span class="varspell" title="Commandment">Commandement</span> is <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> in a <span class="varspell" title="plural">plurall</span> sense, <a href="" id="verse5" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Verse">Vers.</span> 5.</span></a> Now the end of the <span class="varspell" title="Commandment">Commandement</span> is charity. And what more frequent <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in


like manner to say the Law of <span class="mi">Moses.</span> So that either to <span class="varspell" title="restrain">restraine</span> the


significance too much, or too much to <span class="varspell" title="enlarge">inlarg</span> it would make the <a href="" id="adjuration" class="annotBtn">adjuration</a> either


not so <span class="varspell" title="weighty">waighty</span>, or not so pertinent. And thus we find here that the rules of


Church-discipline are not only commanded, but <span class="varspell" title="hedged">hedg'd</span> about with such a terrible


<a href="" id="impalement" class="annotBtn">impalement</a> of commands, as he that will break through <span class="varspell" title="willfully">wilfully</span> to violate the


least of them, must hazard the wounding of his conscience even to death. Yet all


of this notwithstanding we shall <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> them broken <span class="varspell" title="well nigh">wellnigh</span> all by the <span class="varspell" title="fair">faire</span>


pretenders even of the next ages. No <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> to the contempt of him whom they fain


to be the <span class="varspell" title="arch-founder">archfounder</span> of prelaty <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Peter,</span> who by what he writes in the 5


<span class="varspell" title="Chapter">Chap.</span> of his first <a href="" id="Epistle" class="annotBtn">Epistle</a> should <span class="varspell" title="seem">seeme</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> another man <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> tradition


reports him: there he commits to the Presbyters only full authority both of


feeding the flock, and Episcopating: and commands that obedience be given to them


as to the mighty hand of God, <span class="varspell" title="which">w<sup>ch</sup></span> is his mighty ordinance. Yet all


this was as nothing to <span class="varspell" title="repel">repell</span> the <span class="varspell" title="venturous">ventrous</span> <span class="varspell" title="boldness">boldnesse</span> of innovation that <span class="varspell" title="ensued">ensu'd</span>,


changing the decrees of God that is immutable, as if they had been <span class="varspell" title="breathed">breath'd</span> by


man. <span class="varspell" title="Nevertheless">Neverthelesse</span> when Christ by those visions of <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">John</span> <span class="varspell" title="foreshows">foreshewes</span> the


reformation of his Church, he bids him take his <a href="" id="Reed" class="annotBtn">Reed</a> and <span class="varspell" title="mete">meet</span> it out <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span> after


the first <span class="varspell" title="pattern">patterne</span>, for he prescribes him no other. Arise, said the <span class="varspell" title="Angel">Angell</span>, and


measure the Temple of God and the Altar, and them that worship therein. What is


there in the world can measure men but discipline? Our word ruling imports no


<span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span>. Doctrine indeed is the measure, or at least the reason of the measure, <span class="varspell" title="its">tis</span>


true, but <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> the measure be <span class="varspell" title="applied">apply'd</span> to that which it is to measure, how can


it actually <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> <span class="varspell" title="it's">its</span> proper <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span>.  Whether therefore discipline be all one with


doctrine, or the particular application thereof to this or that person, we all


agree that doctrine must be such only as is commanded; or whether it be something


really differing from doctrine, yet was it only of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> appointment, as being the


most <span class="varspell" title="adequate">adequat</span> measure of the Church and her children, which is here the office of


a great Evangelist and the reed given him from heaven. But that part of the


Temple which is not thus <span class="varspell" title="measured">measur'd</span>, so <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> is it from being in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> tuition or


delight, that in the following verse he rejects it, however in <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> and


visibility it may <span class="varspell" title="seem">seeme</span> a part of his Church, yet in as much as it <span class="varspell" title="lies">lyes</span> thus


<span class="varspell" title="unmeasured">unmeasur'd</span> he leaves it to be <span class="varspell" title="trampled">trampl'd</span> by the Gentiles, that is to be polluted


with idolatrous and Gentilish rites and ceremonies. And that the <span class="varspell" title="principal">principall</span>


reformation here foretold is already come to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> as well in discipline as in


doctrine the state of our <a href="" id="neighbor" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="neighbor">neighbour</span></a> Churches afford us to behold. Thus through


all the periods and changes of the Church it <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">beene</span> <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> that God <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span>

must be the next dispute. Wherein this position is to be first <span class="varspell" title="laid">layd</span> down as

two, and none other is of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> ordaining, and if it be, that ordinance must be


evident in the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>. For the imperfect and obscure institution of the Law,


which the <a href="" id="themselves" class="annotBtn">Apostles themselves</a> doubt not oft-times to <span class="varspell" title="vilify">vilifie</span>, cannot give rules

the <span class="varspell" title="original">originall</span> of Episcopacy newly <span class="varspell" title="revised">revis'd</span> begins thus. The ground of Episcopacy


is <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetcht</span> partly from the pattern <span class="varspell" title="prescribed">prescrib'd</span> by God in the Old Testament, and


partly from the imitation thereof brought in by the Apostles. Herein I must


entreat to be <span class="varspell" title="excused">excus'd</span> of the desire I have to be <span class="varspell" title="satisfied">satisfi'd</span>, how for example the


ground of <span class="varspell" title="Episcopacy">Episcop.</span> is <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetch't</span> partly from the example of the old Testament, by


whom next, and by whose authority. Secondly, how the Church-government under the


<span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> can be rightly <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> an imitation of that in the old Testament? for that


the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> is the end and fulfilling of the Law, our liberty also from the


bondage of the Law I plainly <span class="varspell" title="read">reade</span>. How then the ripe age of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> should


be put to <span class="varspell" title="school">schoole</span> <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span>, and learn to <span class="varspell" title="govern">governe</span> <span class="varspell" title="herself">her selfe</span> from the infancy of the


Law, the stronger to imitate the weaker, the freeman to follow the captive, the


learned to be <span class="varspell" title="lessoned">lesson'd</span> by the rude, will be a hard undertaking to evince from any


of those principles which either art or inspiration <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> written. If <span class="varspell" title="anything">any thing</span>


done by the Apostles may be <span class="varspell" title="drawn">drawne</span> howsoever to a <span class="varspell" title="likeness">likenesse</span> of something


Mosaicall, if it cannot be <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> that it was done of purpose in imitation, as


having the right thereof grounded in nature, and not in ceremony or type, it will


little <span class="varspell" title="avail">availe</span> the matter. The whole <span class="varspell" title="Judaic">Judaick</span> law is either <span class="varspell" title="political">politicall</span>, and to take


pattern by that, no Christian nation ever thought <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> <span class="varspell" title="obliged">oblig'd</span> in conscience;


or <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span>, which <span class="varspell" title="contains">containes</span> in it the observation of whatsoever is substantially,


and perpetually true and good, either in religion, or course of life. That which


is thus <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span>, besides what we fetch from those unwritten <span class="varspell" title="laws">lawes</span> and Ideas which


nature <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="engraven">ingraven</span> in us, the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>, as stands with her dignity most,


lectures to us from her own <span class="varspell" title="authentic">authentick</span> <span class="varspell" title="handwriting">hand-writing</span> and command, not copies out


from the <span class="varspell" title="borrowed">borrow'd</span> manuscript of a subservient <span class="varspell" title="scroll">scrowl</span>, by way of imitating. As


well might she be said in her Sacrament of water to imitate the <span class="varspell" title="baptism">baptisme</span> of


<span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="John">Iohn</span>.</span> What though she <span class="varspell" title="retain">retaine</span> excommunication <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> in the Synagogue,


retain the morality of the Sabbath, she does not therefore imitate the law her


underling, but perfect her. All that was morally <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliver'd</span> from the law to the


<span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> in the office of the Priests and Levites, was that there should be a


<span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span> set <span class="varspell" title="apart">a part</span> to teach and discipline the Church, both which duties the


Apostles thought good to commit to the Presbyters. And if any distinction of


<span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> were to be made among them, they directed it should be to those not that


only rule well, but especially to those that <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> in the <a href="" id="1timothy58" class="annotBtn">word and doctrine</a>. 
By which we are taught that laborious teaching is the most <span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> Prelaty that


one Minister can have above another in the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>: if therefore the superiority


of Bishopship be grounded on the Priesthood as part of the <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> law, it cannot


be said to be an imitation; for it were ridiculous that morality should imitate


morality, which ever was the same thing. This very word of patterning or


imitating excludes Episcopacy from the solid and grave <span class="varspell" title="Ethical">Ethicall</span> law, and <span class="varspell" title="betrays">betraies</span>


it to be a <span class="varspell" title="mere">meere</span> <span class="varspell" title="child">childe</span> of ceremony, or likelier some misbegotten thing, that


having <span class="varspell" title="plucked">pluckt</span> the gay feathers of her <span class="varspell" title="obsolete">obsolet</span> bravery to hide her own deformed


<span class="varspell" title="bareness">barenesse</span>, now vaunts and glories in her <span class="varspell" title="stolen">stolne</span> plumes. In the <span class="varspell" title="meanwhile">meane while</span> what


danger there is against the very life of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> to make in <span class="varspell" title="anything">any thing</span> the


typical law her pattern, and how impossible in that which touches the Priestly


government, I shall use such light as I have <span class="varspell" title="received ">receav'd</span>, to lay open. It cannot be


<span class="varspell" title="unknown">unknowne</span> by what expressions the holy Apostle <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span> spares not to


<span class="varspell" title="explain">explane</span> to us the nature and condition of the law, calling those ordinances which


were the <span class="varspell" title="chief">chiefe</span> and <span class="varspell" title="essential">essentiall</span> offices of the Priests, the elements and rudiments


of the world both <span class="varspell" title="weak">weake</span> and beggarly. Now to breed, and bring up the children of


the promise, the heirs of liberty and grace under such a <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of government as


is <span class="varspell" title="professed">profest</span> to be but an imitation of that <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span> which <span class="varspell" title="engendered">engender'd</span> to bondage


the sons of <span class="mi">Agar,</span> how can this be but a foul injury and derogation, if not


a cancelling of that birth-right and immunity which Christ <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="purchased">purchas'd</span> for us


with his blood. For the ministration of the law consisting of <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> things,


drew to it such a <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span> as consisted of <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> respects, dignity,


precedence, and the like. And such a <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span> <span class="varspell" title="established">establish't</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>, as is


founded upon the points and <span class="varspell" title="terms">termes</span> of superiority, and nests <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> in worldly


<span class="varspell" title="honors">honours</span>, will draw to it, and we see it <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span>, such a religion as <span class="varspell" title="runs">runnes</span> back


<span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span> to the old <span class="varspell" title="pomp">pompe</span> and glory of the flesh. For <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span> there is a


<span class="varspell" title="certain">certaine</span> attraction and <span class="varspell" title="magnetic">magnetick</span> force <span class="varspell" title="between">betwixt</span> the religion and the <span class="varspell" title="ministerial">ministeriall</span>


<span class="varspell" title="form">forme</span> thereof. If the religion be pure, <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span>, simple, and lowly, as the


Gospel most truly is, such must the face of the <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span> be. And in like manner


if the <span class="varspell" title="form">forme</span> of the <span class="varspell" title="Ministry">Ministery</span> be grounded in the worldly degrees of <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>,


<span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span>, <span class="varspell" title="temporal">temporall</span> jurisdiction, we see it with our eyes it will <span class="varspell" title="turn">turne</span> the inward


power and purity of the Gospel into the outward carnality of the law; evaporating


and exhaling the <span class="varspell" title="internal">internall</span> worship into empty conformities, and gay <span class="varspell" title="shows">shewes</span>. And


what remains then but that <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> should <span class="varspell" title="run">runne</span> into as dangerous and deadly <span class="varspell" title="apostasy">apostacy</span>


as our lamented <span class="varspell" title="neighbors">neighbours</span> the Papists, who by this very snare and pitfall of


imitating the ceremonial law, <span class="varspell" title="fell">fel</span> into that irrecoverable superstition, as must

<span class="msummary">That it is impossible to make the Priesthood of Aaron a pattern

<p class="first">


<span class="varspell" title="That"><span class="minitial">T</span></span>hat which was <span class="varspell" title="promised">promis'd</span>
next, is to declare the impossibility of grounding <span class="varspell" title="Evangelic">Evangelick</span> government in the imitation of the Jewish


Priesthood: which will be done by considering both the quality of the persons,


and the office <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span>. <span class="mi">Aaron</span> and his <span class="varspell" title="sons">sonnes</span> were the Princes of their


Tribe before they were sanctified to the Priesthood: that <span class="varspell" title="personal">personall</span> eminence


which they held above the other <span class="mi">Levites</span>, they <span class="varspell" title="received ">receav'd</span> not only from their


office, but partly brought it into their office: and so from that time forward


the Priests were not chosen out of the whole number of the Levites, as our


Bishops, but were <span class="varspell" title="born">borne</span> inheritors of the dignity. Therefore <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> we shall


choose our <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> only out of the Nobility, and let them <span class="varspell" title="run">runne</span> in a blood, there


can be no possible imitation of Lording over their brethren in regard of their


persons altogether unlike. As for the office <span class="varspell" title="which">w<sup>ch</sup></span> was a representation


of <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> own person more immediately in the high Priest, &amp; of his whole


priestly office in all the other; to the <span class="varspell" title="performance">performanoe</span> of <span class="varspell" title="which">w<sup>ch</sup></span> the <span class="varspell" title="Levites">Levits</span>


were but as servitors &amp; Deacons, it was necessary there should be a distinction


of dignity <span class="varspell" title="between">betweene</span> two functions of so great <span class="varspell" title="odds">ods</span>. But there being no such


difference among our Ministers, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> it be in reference to the Deacons, it is


impossible to found a Prelaty upon the imitation of this Priesthood. For wherein,


or in what <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> is the office of a <span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span> excellent above that of a Pastor? in


ordination <span class="varspell" title="you'll">you'l</span> say; but flatly against Scripture, for there we know


<span class="mi">Timothy</span> <span class="varspell" title="received ">receav'd</span> ordination by the <a href="" id="hands" class="annotBtn">hands of the Presbytery</a>,


notwithstanding all the <span class="varspell" title="vain">vaine</span> delusions that are <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> to evade that testimony,


and <span class="varspell" title="maintain">maintaine</span> an unwarrantable usurpation. But wherefore should ordination be a


cause of setting up a superior degree in the Church? is not that whereby Christ


became our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span> a higher and greater <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that whereby he did <span class="varspell" title="ordain">ordaine</span>


messengers to preach and publish him our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>? Every Minister sustains the


person of Christ in his highest work of communicating to us the mysteries of our


salvation, and <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> the power of binding and absolving, how should he need a


higher dignity to represent or execute that which is an inferior work in Christ?


why should the performance of ordination which is a lower office exalt a <span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span>,


and not the <span class="varspell" title="seldom">seldome</span> discharge of a higher and more noble office <span class="varspell" title="which">w<sup>ch</sup></span>


is preaching and <span class="varspell" title="administering">administring</span> much rather <span class="varspell" title="depress">depresse</span> him? Verily neither the


nature, nor the example of ordination <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> any way require an imparity <span class="varspell" title="between">betweene</span>


the ordainer and the ordained. For what more <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> every like to produce


his like, man to beget man, fire to propagate fire, and in examples of highest

<span class="varspell" title="It"><span class="minitial">I</span></span>t <span class="varspell" title="follows">followes</span>


here to attend to <span class="varspell" title="certain">certaine</span> objections in <a href="" id="cbt" class="annotBtn">a little treatise</a> lately printed among


others of like sort at <span class="mi">Oxford,</span> and in the title said to be out of the <a href="" id="rude" class="annotBtn">rude

so much that it is <span class="varspell" title="marvel">marvell</span> to think what his friends meant to let come abroad


such shallow reasonings with the name of a man so much bruited for learning. In


<a href="" id="pages" class="annotBtn">the 12 and 23 pages</a> he <span class="varspell" title="seems">seemes</span> most notoriously inconstant to <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>; for in the


former place he <span class="varspell" title="tells">tels</span> us he <span class="varspell" title="forbears">forbeares</span> to take any argument of Prelaty from


<span class="mi">Aaron,</span> as being the type of Christ. In the latter he can <span class="varspell" title="forbear">forbeare</span> no


longer, but repents him of his rash gratuity, affirming, that to say, Christ


being come in the flesh, his figure in the high Priest <span class="varspell" title="ceased">ceaseth</span>, is the shift of


an Anabaptist; and stiffly argues that Christ being as well King as Priest, was


as well fore-resembled by the Kings then, as by the high Priest. So that if his


<span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> take away the one type, it must also the other. <span class="varspell" title="marvelous">Marvellous</span> piece of


divinity! and well worth that the land should pay six thousand pound a <span class="varspell" title="year">yeare</span> for,

the <span class="varspell" title="Socratic">Socratick</span>


<span class="varspell" title="school">schoole</span> famously refuted <span class="varspell" title="without">with out</span> hire. Here we have the type of the King <a href="" id="tippet" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="sewed">sow'd</span> to

<p class="first">


But where, O Bishop, <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> the purpose of the law set forth Christ to us as a


King? That which never was intended in the Law, can never be <span class="varspell" title="abolished">abolish't</span> as part


thereof. When the Law was made, there was no King: if before the law, or under


the law God by a <span class="varspell" title="special">speciall</span> type in any King would <span class="varspell" title="foresignify">foresignifie</span> the future <span class="varspell" title="kingdom">kingdome</span>


of Christ, which is not yet visibly come, what was that to the law? The whole


<span class="varspell" title="ceremonial">ceremoniall</span> law, and types can be in no law else, comprehends nothing but the


propitiatory office of <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> Priesthood, which being in substance <span class="varspell" title="accomplished">accomplisht</span>,


both law and Priesthood fades away of <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span>, and passes into <span class="varspell" title="air">aire</span> like a


transitory vision, and the right of Kings neither stands by any type nor falls.


We acknowledge that the <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> magistrate <span class="varspell" title="wears">weares</span> an <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> giving, and


ought to be <span class="varspell" title="obeyed">obey'd</span> as his vicegerent. But to make a King a type, we say is an


abusive and <span class="varspell" title="unskillful">unskilfull</span> speech, and of a <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> solidity makes it <span class="varspell" title="seem">seeme</span> a


<span class="varspell" title="ceremonial">ceremoniall</span> shadow. Therefore your typical <span class="varspell" title="chain">chaine</span> of King and Priest must unlink.


But is not the type of Priest taken away by <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span>? no <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> this famous


<a href="" id="andrews2" class="annotBtn">Protestant Bishop of Winchester</a>; it is not, and he that <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> it is, is an


Anabaptist. What think <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> Readers, do <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> not understand him? What can be <span class="varspell" title="gathered">gather'd</span>


hence but that the <span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span> would still sacrifice? <span class="varspell" title="conceive">conceave</span> him readers, he would


<a href="" id="missificate" class="annotBtn">missificate</a>. Their altars indeed were in a fair <span class="varspell" title="forwardness">forwardnesse</span>; and by such


arguments as these they were setting up the molten <span class="varspell" title="Calf">Calfe</span> of their <span class="varspell" title="Mass">Masse</span> <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span>,


and of their great Hierarch the Pope. For if the type of Priest be not taken


away, then neither of the high Priest, it were a strange beheading; and high


Priest more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> one there cannot be, and that one can be no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a Pope.


And this <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span> was the bent of his career, though never so covertly. Yea but


there was something else in the high Priest besides the figure, as is plain by <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span>


<span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paul's">Pauls</span></span> acknowledging him. <span class="varspell" title="Its">Tis</span> true that in the <a href="" id="deut17" class="annotBtn">17 of <span
class="mi">Deut.</span></a> whence


this <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> arises to the Priest in matters too hard for the secular judges, as


must needs be many in the occasions of those times <span class="varspell" title="involved">involv'd</span> so with <span class="varspell" title="ceremonial">ceremoniall</span>


niceties, no wonder though it be commanded to <span class="varspell" title="inquire">enquire</span> at the mouth of the


Priests, who besides the Magistrates their <span class="varspell" title="colleagues">collegues</span> had the <a href="" id="urim" class="annotBtn">Oracle of Urim</a> to


consult with. And whether the high Priest <a href="" id="ananias" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ananias</span></a> had not <span class="varspell" title="encroached">incroach't</span>


beyond the limits of his Priestly <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>, or whether <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> it rightly, was no


time then for <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span> to contest about. But if this instance be able to


assert any right of jurisdiction to the Clergy, it must impart it in common to


all Ministers, since it were a great folly to <span class="varspell" title="seek">seeke</span> for <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> in a hard


<span class="varspell" title="intricate">intricat</span> scruple from a <a href="" id="dunce" class="annotBtn">Dunce</a> <span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span>, when there might be found a speedier


solution from a grave and learned Minister, whom God <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> gifted with the


<span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> of Urim more amply oft-times then all the Prelates together; and now in


the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> granted the privilege of this <a href="" id="ephod" class="annotBtn">oraculous Ephod</a> alike to all his


Ministers. The reason therefore of imparity in the Priests, being now as is


aforesaid, really <span class="varspell" title="annulled">annull'd</span> both in their person, and in their representative


office, what right of jurisdiction soever can be from this place <a href="" id="levitically" class="annotBtn">Levitically


<span class="varspell" title="bequeathed">bequeath'd</span></a>, must descend upon the Ministers of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> equally, as it <span class="varspell" title="finds">findes</span>


them in all other points <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span>. Well then he is finally content to <a href="" id="aaron" class="annotBtn">let


<span class="mi">Aaron</span> go.</a> <a href="" id="eleazar" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Eleazar</span></a> will serve his <span class="varspell" title="turn">turne</span>, as being a

superiors, and yet no type of Christ in <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Aaron's">Aarons</span></span> <span class="varspell" title="lifetime">life time</span>. O <span class="varspell" title="you">thou</span> that

crooks &amp; emendations; <span class="varspell" title="Hear">Heare</span> then; the type of Christ in some one particular, as


of <span class="varspell" title="entering">entring</span> yearly into the Holy of holies and such like, rested upon the High


Priest only as more immediately personating our <span class="varspell" title="Savior">Saviour</span>: but to resemble his


whole satisfactory office all the lineage of <span class="mi">Aaron</span> was no more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>


sufficient. And all, or any of the Priests, <span class="varspell" title="considered">consider'd</span> separately without


relation to the highest, are but as a <span class="varspell" title="lifeless">livelesse</span> trunk and <span class="varspell" title="signify">signfie</span> nothing. And


this <span class="varspell" title="shows">shewes</span> the excellence of <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> sacrifice, who at once and in one person


<span class="varspell" title="fulfilled">fulfill'd</span> that which many <span class="varspell" title="hundreds">hunderds</span> of Priests many times repeating had <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to


<span class="varspell" title="forshow">forshew</span>. What other imparity there was among themselves, we may safely suppose


it depended on the dignity of their birth and family, together with the


circumstances of a <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> service, which might afford many priorities. And this


I take to be the <span class="varspell" title="sum">summe</span> of what the Bishop <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> laid together to make plea for


Prelaty by imitation of the Law. Though indeed, if it may stand, it will <span class="varspell" title="infer">inferre</span>


<span class="varspell" title="Popedom">Popedome</span> all as well. Many other courses he tries, enforcing <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> with much


ostentation of <a href="" id="genealogies" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="endless">endlesse</span> genealogies</a>, as if he were the man that <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span>


<span class="varspell" title="forewarns">forewarnes</span> us of <a href="" id="warns" class="annotBtn">in <span class="mi">Timothy,</span></a> but so unvigorously, that I do not <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> his


winning of many to his cause, but such as doting upon great names are either


over-<span class="varspell" title="weak">weake</span>, or over sudden of faith. I shall not refuse therefore to <span class="varspell" title="learn">learne</span> so


much prudence as I <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> in the <a href="" id="soldier" class="annotBtn">Roman <span class="varspell" title="Soldier">Souldier</span></a> that attended the <span class="varspell" title="cross">crosse</span>, not to


stand breaking of legs, when the breath is quite out of the body, but <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> to


that which follows. The <span class="varspell" title="Primate">Primat</span> of <span class="mi">Armagh</span> at the <a href="" id="tractate" class="annotBtn">beginning of his <span class="varspell" title="tractate">tractat</span></a>


seeks to <span class="varspell" title="avail">availe</span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> of that place in the <a href="" id="isaiah66" class="annotBtn">66 of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Isaiah">Esaiah</span>,</span></a> I will take of


them for Priests and Levites, <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> the Lord; to uphold hereby such a <span class="varspell" title="form">forme</span> of


superiority among the ministers of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> succeeding those in the law, as


the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> day did the Sabbath. But certain if this method may be admitted of


interpreting those <span class="varspell" title="prophetical">propheticall</span> passages concerning Christian times in a


<span class="varspell" title="punctual">punctuall</span> correspondence, it may with <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> probability be <span class="varspell" title="urged">urg'd</span> upon us,


that we are bound to observe some monthly solemnity answerable to the new moons,


as well as the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> day which we <span class="varspell" title="keep">keepe</span> in lieu of the Sabbath: for in <a href="" id="isaiah23" class="annotBtn">the 23 <span class="varspell" title="verse">v.</span></a>


the Prophet <span class="varspell" title="joins">joynes</span> them in the same manner together, as before he did the Priests


and Levites, thus. And it shall come to <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> that from one new <span class="varspell" title="moon">moone</span> to another,


and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith


the Lord. Undoubtedly with as good consequence may it be <span class="varspell" title="alleged">alledg'd</span> from hence,


that we are to solemnize some religious monthly meeting different from the


Sabbath, as from the other any distinct formality of <span class="varspell" title="Ecclesiastical">Ecclesiasticall</span> orders may


be <span class="varspell" title="inferred">inferr'd</span>. This rather will <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> to be the <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> and <span class="varspell" title="unconstrained">unconstrain'd</span> sense


of the text, that God in taking of them for Priests and Levites, will not <span class="varspell" title="esteem">esteeme</span>


them unworthy though <a href="" id="gentiles" class="annotBtn">Gentiles</a>, to <span class="varspell" title="undergo">undergoe</span> any function in the Church, but will


make of them a full and perfect <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span>, as was that of the Priests and Levites


in their <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span>. And Bishop <span class="mi">Andrews</span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> to end the <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span>, sends


us a candid exposition of this quoted verse from <a href="" id="page24" class="annotBtn">the 24 page</a> of his said book,


plainly deciding that God by those <span class="varspell" title="legal">legall</span> names there of Priests and Levites


means our Presbyters, and Deacons, for which either ingenuous confession, or slip


of his pen we give him thanks, and <span class="varspell" title="withal">withall</span> to him that brought these treatises


into one volume, who setting the contradictions of two learned men so <span class="varspell" title="near">neere</span>


together, did not foresee. What other deducements or analogies are cited out of


<span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span> to prove a <span class="varspell" title="likeness">likenesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="between">betweene</span> the Ministers of the Old and New


Testament, having <span class="varspell" title="tried">tri'd</span> their <span class="varspell" title="sinews">sinewes</span> I judge they may <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> without <span class="varspell" title="harm">harme</span> doing


to our cause. We may remember then that Prelaty neither <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> nor can have


foundation in the law, nor yet in the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>, which assertion as being for the


<span class="varspell" title="plainness">plainnesse</span> thereof a matter of eye sight, rather <span class="varspell" to="than">then</span> of disquisition I


voluntarily <span class="varspell" title="omit">omitt</span>, not forgetting to <span class="varspell" title="specify">specifie</span> this note <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span>, that the earnest


desire which the Prelates have to build their Hierarchy upon the sandy <span class="varspell" title="bottom">bottome</span> of


the law, gives us to see abundantly the little assurance which they <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> to


<span class="varspell" title="rear">reare</span> up their high roofs by the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>, <span class="varspell" title="repulsed">repulst</span> as it were from


the writings of the Apostles, and driven to take sanctuary among the <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span>. Hence


that open confession of the <span class="varspell" title="Primate">Primat</span> before <span class="varspell" title="mentioned">mention'd</span>. Episcopacy is <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetcht</span> partly


from the <span class="varspell" title="pattern">patterne</span> of the Old Testament, &amp; partly from the New as an imitation of


the Old, though nothing can be more rotten in Divinity <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> such a position as


this, and is all one as to say Episcopacy is partly of divine institution, and


partly of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> own carving. For who gave the <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> to fetch more from the


<span class="varspell" title="pattern">patterne</span> of the law <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> what the Apostles had already <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetcht</span>, if they <span class="varspell" title="fetched">fetcht </span> <span class="varspell" title="anything">any


thing</span> at all, as <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">beene</span> <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> they did not. So was <a href="" id="jereboam" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jereboam's">Jereboams</span></span>


Episcopacy</a> partly from the <span class="varspell" title="pattern">patterne</span> of the law, and partly from the <span class="varspell" title="pattern">patterne</span> of


his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> carnality; a parti-<span class="varspell" title="colored">colour'd</span> and a parti-<span class="varspell" title="membered">member'd</span> Episcopacy, and what


can this be <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a monstrous? Others therefore among the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> perhaps


not so well able to brook, or rather to <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> this <span class="varspell" title="foul">foule</span> relapsing to the old


law, have <span class="varspell" title="condescended">condiscended</span> at last to a <span class="varspell" title="plain">plaine</span> confessing that both the names and


offices of Bishops and Presbyters at first were the same, and in the Scriptures


<span class="varspell" title="nowhere">no where</span> <span class="varspell" title="distinguished">distinguisht</span>. This grants <a href="" id="hall" class="annotBtn">the remonstrant</a> in the <span class="varspell" title="fifth">fift</span> Section of his


<span class="varspell" title="defense">defence</span>, and in the Preface to his last short answer. But what need respect be


had whether he grant or grant it not, when as through all antiquity, and even in


the loftiest times of Prelaty we find it granted. <a href="" id="jerome" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Jerome</span></a> the <span class="varspell" title="learnedest">learned'st</span> of


the Fathers hides not his opinion, that <span class="varspell" title="custom">custome</span> only, which the <span class="varspell" title="Proverb">Proverbe</span> <span class="varspell" title="calls">cals</span> a


tyrant, was the maker of Prelaty; before his audacious workmanship the Churches


were <span class="varspell" title="ruled">rul'd</span> in common by the Presbyters. and such a <span class="varspell" title="certain">certaine</span> truth this was


<span class="varspell" title="esteemed">esteem'd</span>, that it became a decree among the <span class="varspell" title="Papal">Papall</span> Canons <span class="varspell" title="compiled">compil'd</span> by


<a href="" id="gratian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Gratian</span></a>. <a href="" id="anselm" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Anselme</span></a> also of Canturbury, who to uphold
the points of his Prelatisme made <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> a <span class="varspell" title="traitor">traytor</span> to his country, yet commenting the


Epistles to <span class="mi">Titus</span> and the <span class="mi">Philippians</span> acknowledges
from the <span class="varspell" title="clearness">cleernesse</span> of the text, what <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Jerome">Ierome</span></span> and the Church Rubrick <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> before


<span class="varspell" title="acknowledged">acknowledg'd</span>. He little <span class="varspell" title="dreamed">dreamt</span> then that the weeding-hook of reformation would


after two ages pluck up his glorious poppy from insulting over the <a href="" id="corn" class="annotBtn">good <span class="varspell" title="corn">corne</span></a>.


Though since some of our <span class="varspell" title="British">Brittish</span> Prelates seeing themselves <span class="varspell" title="pressed">prest</span> to produce


Scripture, try all their cunning, if the New Testament will not help them, to


frame of their own heads as it were with wax a kind of <span class="varspell" title="Mimic">Mimick</span> Bishop <span class="varspell" title="limbed">limm'd</span> out


to the life of a dead Priesthood. Or else they would <span class="varspell" title="strain">straine</span> us out a <span class="varspell" title="certain">certaine</span>


figurative <span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span>, by wringing the collective allegory of those <a href="" id="angels" class="annotBtn">seven Angels</a> into


seven single <a href="" id="rochets" class="annotBtn">Rochets</a>. Howsoever since it thus <span class="varspell" title="appears">appeares</span> that <span class="varspell" title="custom">custome</span> was the


creator of Prelaty being <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> ancient <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the government of Presbyters, it is


an extreme folly to give them the hearing that tell us of Bishops through so many


ages: and if against their tedious muster of citations, Sees, and successions, it


be <span class="varspell" title="replied">reply'd</span> that wagers and Church antiquities, such as are repugnant to the


<span class="varspell" title="plain">plaine</span> <span class="varspell" title="dictate">dictat</span> of Scripture are both alike the arguments of <span class="varspell" title="fools">fooles</span>, they have


their answer. We rather are to cite all those ages to an arraignment before the


word of God, wherefore, and what pretending, how presuming they durst alter that


divine institution of Presbyters, which the Apostles who were no various and


inconstant men surely had set up in the Churches, and why they choose to live by


<span class="varspell" title="custom">custome</span> and catalogue, or as <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span> <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> by sight and visibility, <a href="" id="faith" class="annotBtn">rather


<span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by faith</a>? But first I conclude from their <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> <span class="varspell" title="mouths">mouthes</span> that <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> command in


Scripture, which <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span> ought to be the first and greatest reason of


Church-government, is wanting to Prelaty. And certainly we have plenteous warrant


in the doctrine of Christ to determine that the want of this reason is of <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> sufficient to confute all other presences that may be brought in <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> of


it.</p>

though writing to them to lay aside <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, in the least word advise them to


change the <span class="varspell" title="Presbyterial">Presbyteriall</span> government into Prelaty. And therefore if God afterward


gave, or permitted this insurrection of Episcopacy, it is to be <span class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span> he did it


in his wrath, as he <a href="" id="king" class="annotBtn">gave the Israelites a King</a>. With so good a will <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> he use

<span class="varspell" title="success">successe</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> fleshly <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> not counseling with God is wont to have. So <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span>


was it from removing <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, that if <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> parted the congregations before,


now it rent and <span class="varspell" title="mangled">mangl'd</span>, now it <span class="varspell" title="raged">rag'd</span>. <span class="varspell" title="Heresy">Heresie</span> begat <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> with a <span class="varspell" title="certain">certaine</span>


monstrous haste of pregnancy in her birth, at once <span class="varspell" title="born">borne</span> and bringing forth.


Contentions before brotherly were now hostile. Men went to choose their Bishop as


they went to a <span class="varspell" title="pitched">pitcht</span> field, and the day of his election was like the sacking of


a City, sometimes ended with the blood of thousands. Nor this among <span class="varspell" title="heretics">hereticks</span>


only, but men of the same <span class="varspell" title="belief">beliefe</span>, yea confessors, and that with such odious


ambition, that <a href="" id="eusebius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Eusebius</span> in his eighth book</a> testifies he <span class="varspell" title="abhorred">abhorr'd</span> to write.


And the reason is not obscure, for the <span class="varspell" title="poor">poore</span> dignity or rather burden of a


Parochial Presbyter could not <span class="varspell" title="engage">ingage</span> any great party, nor that to any deadly


feud: but Prelaty was a power of that extent, and sway, that if her election were


popular, it was <span class="varspell" title="seldom">seldome</span> not the cause of some faction or broil in the Church. But


if her dignity came by <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> of some Prince, she was from that time his


creature, and obnoxious to comply with his ends in state were they right or


wrong. So that <span class="varspell" title="instead">in stead</span> of finding Prelaty an impeacher of <span class="varspell" title="Schism">Schisme</span> or faction,


the more I search, the more I grow into all <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> to think rather that


faction and she as with a <span class="varspell" title="spousal">spousall</span> ring are wedded together, never to be <span class="varspell" title="divorced">divorc't</span>.


But here let every one behold the just, and <span class="varspell" title="dreadful">dreadfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> of God meeting


with the audacious pride of man that durst offer to mend the ordinances of


heaven. God out of the strife of men brought forth by his Apostles to the Church


that beneficent and ever distributing office of Deacons, the stewards and


Ministers of holy <span class="varspell" title="alms">almes</span>, man out of the pretended care of peace &amp; unity being


caught in the snare of his impious <span class="varspell" title="boldness">boldnesse</span> to correct the will of Christ,


brought forth to <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> upon the Church that <span class="varspell" title="irreconcilable">irreconcileable</span> <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> of


perdition and Apostasy, the Roman Antichrist: for that the exaltation of the Pope


arose out of the reason of Prelaty it cannot be <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span>. And as I noted before


that the <span class="varspell" title="pattern">patterne</span> of the High Priest pleaded for in the Gospel (for take away the


head Priest the rest are but a <span class="varspell" title="carcass">carcasse</span>) sets up with better reason a Pope, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>


an Archbishop, for if Prelaty must still rise and rise till it come to a <span class="varspell" title="Primate">Primat</span>,


why should it stay there? when as the <span class="varspell" title="catholic">catholick</span> government is not to follow the


division of <span class="varspell" title="kingdoms">kingdomes</span>, the temple best representing the <span class="varspell" title="universal">universall</span> Church, and


the High Priest the <span class="varspell" title="universal">universall</span> head; so I observe here, that if to quiet <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>


there must be one head of Prelaty in a land or Monarchy rising from a <span class="varspell" title="Provincial">Provinciall</span>


to a <span class="vaarspell" title="national">nationall</span> Primacy, there may upon better grounds of repressing <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> be


set up one <span class="varspell" title="catholic">catholick</span> head over the <span class="varspell" title="catholic">catholick</span> Church. For the peace and good of


the Church is not terminated in the <span class="varspell" title="schismless">schismelesse</span> estate of one or two <span class="varspell" title="kingdoms">kingdomes</span>,


but should be provided for by the <span class="varspell" title="joint">joynt</span> consultation of all reformed


<span class="varspell" title="Christendom">Christendome</span>: that all <span class="varspell" title="controversy">controversie</span> may end in the <span class="varspell" title="final">finall</span> pronounce or canon of


one <span class="varspell" title="Arch-primate">Arch-primat</span>, or Protestant Pope. Although by this <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> for ought I see, all


the diameters of <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> may as well meet and be knit up in the center of one


grand <span class="varspell" title="falsehood">falshood</span>. Now let all <span class="varspell" title="impartial">impartiall</span> men arbitrate what goodly inference these


two <span class="varspell" title="main">maine</span> reasons of the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> have, that by a <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> league of consequence


make more for the Pope <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> for themselves. Yea to say more home are the very


<span class="varspell" title="womb">wombe</span> for a new subantichrist to breed in; if it be not rather the old force and


power of the same man of sin counterfeiting protestant. It was not the prevention


of <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, but it was <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span>, and the <span class="varspell" title="hateful">hatefull</span> thirst of Lording in


the Church that first <span class="varspell" title="bestowed">bestow'd</span> a being upon Prelaty; this was the true cause, but


the pretence is <span class="varspell" title="still">stil</span> the same. The Prelates, as they would have it thought, are


the only <span class="varspell" title="mauls">mawls</span> of <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>. Forsooth if they be put <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span>, a deluge of innumerable


sects will follow; we shall be all <a href="" id="brownists" class="annotBtn">Brownists, Familists, Anabaptists</a>. For the


word Puritan <span class="varspell" title="seems">seemes</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="quashed">quasht</span>, and all that heretofore were counted such, are


now Brownists. And thus <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> they raise an <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> report upon the expected


reforming grace that God <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> bid us hope for, like those <span class="varspell" title="faithless">faithlesse</span> spies, whose


carcasses shall perish in the <span class="varspell" title="wilderness">wildernesse</span> of their <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> confused ignorance, and


never taste the good of reformation. <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> they keep away <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>? if to bring a


<span class="varspell" title="numb">num</span> and <span class="varspell" title="chill">chil</span> stupidity of soul, an unactive <span class="varspell" title="blindness">blindnesse</span> of <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> upon the people


by their leaden doctrine, or no doctrine at all, if to persecute all knowing and


zealous Christians by the violence of their courts, be to keep away <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, they


keep away <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> indeed; and by this kind of discipline all <span class="mi">Italy</span> and


<span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Spain">Spaine</span></span> is as purely and <span class="varspell" title="politically">politickly</span> kept from <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> as <span
class="mi">England</span> <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span>


<span class="varspell" title="been">beene</span> by them. With as good a plea might the dead <span class="varspell" title="palsy">palsie</span> boast to a man, tis I


that free you from stitches and <span class="varspell" title="pains">paines</span>, and the troublesome feeling of cold &amp;


heat, of wounds and stroke; if I were gone, all these would molest you. The


Winter might as well vaunt <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> against the Spring, I destroy all <span class="varspell" title="noisome">noysome</span> and


rank weeds, I <span class="varspell" title="keep">keepe</span> <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span> all pestilent <span class="varspell" title="vapors">vapours</span>. Yes and all wholesome herbs, and


all fresh dews, by your violent &amp; hidebound frost; but when the gentle west winds


shall open the <span class="varspell" title="fruitful">fruitfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="bosom">bosome</span> of the earth thus over-girded by your


imprisonment, then the flowers put forth and spring, and then the <span class="varspell" title="Sun">Sunne</span> shall


scatter the mists, and the manuring hand of the Tiller shall root up all that


burdens the <span class="varspell" title="soil">soile</span> without thank to your bondage. But <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any frozen


captivity is the bondage of Prelates, for that other, if it keep down <span class="varspell" title="anything">any thing</span>


which is good, within the earth, so <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> it likewise that which is ill, but these


let out freely the ill, and keep down the good, or else <span class="varspell" title="keep">keepe</span> <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span> the lesser


ill, and let out the greatest. Be <span class="varspell" title="ashamed">asham'd</span> at last to tell the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> <span class="varspell" title="curb">curbe</span>


<span class="varspell" title="Schismatics">Schismaticks</span>, when as they know <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> cherish and side with Papists, and are now as


it were one party with them, and tis said they <span class="varspell" title="help">helpe</span> to petition for <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span>. Can we


believe that your government strains in good earnest at the petty gnats of


<span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, when as we see it makes nothing to swallow the Camel <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> of


<span class="mi">Rome;</span> but that indeed your throats are of the right Pharisaical <span class="varspell" title="strain">straine</span>.


Where are those <span class="varspell" title="schismatics">schismaticks</span> with whom the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> hold such hot skirmish? <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span>


us your acts, those glorious annals which your Courts of loathed memory lately


<span class="varspell" title="deceased">deceas'd</span> have left us? those <span class="varspell" title="schismatics">schismaticks</span> I doubt me <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> be found the most of


them such as whose only <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> was to have spoke the truth against your high


abominations and cruelties in the Church; this is the <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> hate most, the


<span class="varspell" title="removal">removall</span> of your criminous Hierarchy. A <span class="varspell" title="politic">politick</span> government of yours, and of a


pleasant conceit, set up to remove those as a pretended <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, that would


remove you as a palpable <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> in government. If the <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> would pardon <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span>


that, she might go <span class="varspell" title="jagged">jagg'd</span> in as many cuts and slashes as she <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleas'd</span> for you. As


for the rending of the Church, we have many reasons to <span class="varspell" title="think">thinke</span> it is not that


which <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> to prevent so much as the rending of your <span class="varspell" title="pontifical">pontificall</span> sleeves:


that <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> would be the sorest <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> to you, that would be <span class="varspell" title="Brownism">Brownisme</span> and


<span class="varspell" title="Anabaptism">Anabaptisme</span> indeed. If we go <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span>, say you, as if <a href="" id="hadrian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"> <span class="varspell" title="Hadrian's">Adrians</span> </span> wall</a> were
broke, a


flood of sects will rush in. What sects? What are their opinions? give us the


Inventory; it will <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> both by your former prosecutions and your present


instances, that they are only such to <span class="varspell" title="speak">speake</span> of as are offended with your


<span class="varspell" title="lawless">lawlesse</span> government, your ceremonies, your Liturgy, <a href="" id="massbook" class="annotBtn">an extract of the <span class="varspell" title="Mass">Masse</span> book</a>


translated. But that they should be <span class="varspell" title="condemners">contemners</span> of <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> prayer, and Churches


<span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> without superstition, I trust God will manifest it ere long to be as false a


slander, as your former <a href="" id="scots" class="annotBtn">slanders against the Scots</a>. Noise it till <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> be hoarse;


that a rabble of Sects will come in, it will be <span class="varspell" title="answered">answer'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span>, no rabble sir


Priest, but a unanimous multitude of good Protestants will then <span class="varspell" title="join">joyne</span> to the


Church, which now because of you stand separated. This will be the <span class="varspell" title="dreadful">dreadfull</span>


consequence of your <span class="varspell" title="removal">removall</span>. As for those terrible names of Sectaries and


<span class="varspell" title="Schismatics">Schismaticks</span> which <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> have got together, we know your manner of fight, when the


quiver of your arguments which is ever thin, and weakly <span class="varspell" title="stored">stor'd</span>, after the first


brunt is quite empty, your course is to betake <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> to your other quiver of


slander, wherein <span class="varspell" title="lies">lyes</span> your best archery. And whom <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> could not move by


<span class="varspell" title="sophistical">sophisticall</span> arguing, them you <span class="varspell" title="think">thinke</span> to confute by scandalous misnaming. Thereby


inciting the blinder sort of people to mislike and deride sound doctrine and good


christianity under two or three vile and <span class="varspell" title="hateful">hatefull</span> terms. But if we could easily


<span class="varspell" title="endure">indure</span> and dissolve your doubtiest reasons in argument, we shall more easily


<span class="varspell" title="bear">beare</span> the worst of your <span class="varspell" title="unreasonableness">unreasonablenesse</span> in calumny and false report. Especially


being <a href="" id="foretold" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="foretold">fortold</span> by Christ</a>, that if he our Master were by your predecessors <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span>


Samaritan and <span class="varspell" title="Beelzebub">Belzebub</span>, we must not think it strange if his best Disciples in the


reformation, as at first by those of your tribe they were <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> <a href="" id="lollards" class="annotBtn">Lollards and


Hussites</a>, so now by you be <span class="varspell" title="termed">term'd</span> Puritans, and Brownists. But my hope is that


the people of England will not suffer themselves to be <span class="varspell" title="juggled">juggl'd</span> thus out of their


faith and religion by a mist of names cast before their eyes, but will search


wisely by the Scriptures, and look quite through this fraudulent aspersion of a


<span class="varspell" title="disgraceful">disgracefull</span> name into the things themselves: knowing that the Primitive


Christians in their times were accounted such as are now <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> Familists and


<a href="" id="adamites" class="annotBtn">Adamites</a>, or worse. And many on the <span class="varspell" title="Prelatic side">Prelatickside</span> like the <a href="" id="sardis" class="annotBtn">Church of <span class="mi">Sardis</span></a> have a name to live, and yet are dead; to be Protestants, and are


indeed Papists in most of their principles. Thus <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span>, this your old fallacy


<span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> shall <span class="varspell" title="soon">soone</span> unmask, and quickly apprehend how you prevent <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, and who


are your <span class="varspell" title="schismatics">schismaticks</span>. But what if <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> prevent, and hinder all good means of


preventing <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>? that way which the Apostles <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>, was to call a <span class="varspell" title="council">councell</span>;


from which by <span class="varspell" title="anything">any thing</span> that can be <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span> from the <a href="" id="acts15" class="annotBtn">fifteenth of the <span class="mi">Acts,</span></a>


no <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> Christian was <span class="varspell" title="debarred">debarr'd</span>, to whom knowledge and piety might give


entrance. Of such a <span class="varspell" title="council">councell</span> as this every <span class="varspell" title="parochial">parochiall</span> Consistory is a right


homogeneous and constituting part being in <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> as it were a little Synod,


and towards a <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> assembly moving upon her own basis in an even and <span class="varspell" title="firm">firme</span>


progression, as those smaller squares in <span class="varspell" title="battle">battell</span> unite in one great cube, the


main phalanx, an <span class="varspell" title="emblem">embleme</span> of truth and <span class="varspell" title="steadfastness">stedfastnesse</span>. Whereas on the other side


Prelaty ascending by a <span class="varspell" title="gradual">graduall</span> monarchy from Bishop to Arch-bishop, from thence


to <span class="varspell" title="Primate">Primat</span>, and from thence, for there can be no reason <span class="varspell" title="yielded">yeilded</span> neither in nature,


nor in religion, wherefore, if it have lawfully mounted thus high, it should not


be a Lordly <span class="varspell" title="ascendant">ascendent</span> in the horoscope of the Church, from Primate to Patriarch,


and so to Pope. I say Prelaty thus ascending in a <span class="varspell" title="continual">continuall</span> pyramid upon


pretence to perfect the <span class="varspell" title="Church's">Churches</span> unity, if notwithstanding it be found most


<span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span>, yea the utmost <span class="varspell" title="help">helpe</span> to <span class="varspell" title="darn">dearn</span> up the rents of <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> by calling a


<span class="varspell" title="council">councell</span>, what does it but teach us that Prelaty is of no force to effect this


work which she boasts to be her <span class="varspell" title="masterpiece">maister-peice</span>; and that her pyramid aspires and


sharpens to ambition, not to perfection, or unity. This we know, that as often as


any great <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> disparts the Church, and <span class="varspell" title="Synods">Synonds</span> be <span class="varspell" title="proclaimed">proclam'd</span>, the Presbyters


have as great right there, and as free vote of old, as the Bishops, which the


Canon law conceals not. So that Prelaty if she will seek to close up divisions in


the Church, must be <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span> to dissolve, and unmake her own pyramidal figure,


which she <span class="varspell" title="affirms">affirmes</span> to be of such uniting power, when as indeed it is the most


dividing and <span class="varspell" title="schismatical">schismaticall</span> <span class="varspell" title="form">forme</span> that Geometricians know of, and must be <span class="varspell" title="fain">faine</span> to


<span class="varspell" title="englobe">inglobe</span>, or <span class="varspell" title="encube">incube</span> <span class="varspell" title="herself">her selfe</span> among the Presbyters; which she hating to do, sends


her haughty Prelates from all parts with their <a href="" id="miters" class="annotBtn">forked Miters</a>, the badge of


<span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> or the <span class="varspell" title="stamp">stampe</span> of his cloven foot whom they serve I think, who according


to their hierarchies acuminating still higher and higher in a cone of Prelaty, <span class="varspell" title="instead">in


stead</span> of healing up the gashes of the Church, as it happens in such pointed


bodies meeting, fall to gore one another with their <span class="varspell" title="sharp">sharpe</span> spires for upper


place, and precedence, till the <span class="varspell" title="council">councell</span> <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> prove the greatest <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> of


all. And thus they are so <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> from <span class="varspell" title="hindering">hindring</span> dissension, that they have made


unprofitable, and even <span class="varspell" title="noisome">noysome</span> the chiefest remedy we have to keep Christendom at


one, which is by <span class="varspell" title="councils">councels</span>: and these if <span class="varspell" title="we">wee</span> rightly consider <span class="varspell" title="Apostolic">Apostolick</span> example,


are nothing else but <span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> Presbyteries. This <span class="varspell" title="seemed">seem'd</span> so <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> from the


Apostles to think much of, as if hereby their dignity were <span class="varspell" title="impaired">impair'd</span>, that, as we


may gather by those <a href="" id="epistles" class="annotBtn">Epistles of <span class="mi">Peter</span> and <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="John">Iohn</span></span></a>,
which are likely to


be latest written when the Church grew to a <span class="varspell" title="settling">setling</span>, like those <span class="varspell" title="heroic">heroick</span>


patricians of Rome (if we may use such comparison) hasting to lay <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span> their


<a href="" id="dictatorship" class="annotBtn">dictatorship</a>, they <span class="varspell" title="rejoiced">rejoys't</span> to call themselves and to be as fellow Elders among


their brethren. Knowing that their high office was but as the scaffolding of the


Church yet unbuilt, and would be but a troublesome disfigurement, so <span class="varspell" title="soon">soone</span> as the


building was <span class="varspell" title="finished">finisht</span>. But the lofty minds of an age or two after, such was their


small discerning, thought it a <span class="varspell" title="poor">poore</span> indignity, that the high <span class="varspell" title="reared">rear'd</span> government


of the Church should so on a sudden, as it <span class="varspell" title="seemed">seem'd</span> to them, squat into a


Presbytery. Next or rather before <span class="varspell" title="councils">councels</span> the timeliest prevention of <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> is


to preach the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> abundantly and powerfully throughout all the land, to


instruct the youth religiously, to <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> how the Scriptures may be easiest


understood by all men; to all which the proceedings of these men have been on set


purpose contrary. But how O <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> should you remove <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, and how should you


not remove and oppose all the <span class="varspell" title="means">meanes</span> of removing schism? when Prelaty is a


<span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> from the most reformed and most flourishing of our <span class="varspell" title="neighbor">neighbour</span>


Churches abroad, and a sad subject of discord and <span class="varspell" title="offense">offence</span> to the whole nation at


home. The remedy which you <span class="varspell" title="allege">alledge</span> is the very disease we groan under; and never


can be to us a remedy but by removing <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span>. Your predecessors were <span class="varspell" title="believed">believ'd</span>


to assume this preeminence above their brethren only that they might appease


dissention. Now God and the Church <span class="varspell" title="calls">cals</span> upon you, for the same reason to lay it


down, as being to thousands of good men offensive, burdensome, intolerable.


Surrender that pledge which <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> you <span class="varspell" title="foully">fowlely</span> <span class="varspell" title="usurped">usurpt</span> it, the Church gave you,


and now <span class="varspell" title="claims">claimes</span> it <span class="varspell" title="again">againe</span>, for the reason she first lent it. Discharge the trust


committed to you, prevent <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span>, and that <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> can never do, but by discharging


<span class="varspell" title="yourselves">your selves</span>. That government which <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> hold, we <span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span> prevents much, hinders


much, removes much; but what? the schisms and grievances of the Church? no, but


all the peace and unity, all the welfare not of the Church alone, but of the


whole <span class="varspell" title="kingdom">kingdome</span>. And if it be still permitted <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> to hold, will cause the most sad


I know not whether separation be enough to say, but such a wide <span class="varspell" title="gulf">gulph</span> of


distraction in this land as will never close her <span class="varspell" title="dismal">dismall</span> gap, <span class="varspell" title="until">untill</span> <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> be <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc't</span>


(for of <span class="varspell" title="yourselves">your selvs</span> <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> <span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> never do as that Roman <a href="" id="curtius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Curtius</span></a> nobly did) for


the <span class="varspell" title="Churches'">Churches</span> peace &amp; your countries, to leap into the midst, and be no more seen.


By this we <span class="varspell" title="shall">shal</span> know whether yours be that ancient Prelaty which you say was first


constituted for the reducement of quiet &amp; unanimity into the Church, for then you


<span class="varspell" title="will">wil</span> not delay to prefer that above your own preferment. If otherwise, we must be


confident that your Prelaty is nothing else but your ambition, an insolent


preferring of <span class="varspell" title="yourselves">your selves</span> above your brethren, and all your learned scraping in


antiquity even to <span class="varspell" title="disturb">disturbe</span> the bones of old <span class="mi">Aaron</span> and his <span class="varspell" title="sons">sonnes</span> in their
graves,


is but to maintain and set upon our necks a stately and severe dignity, which you


call sacred, and is nothing in very deed but a grave and reverent gluttony, a


sanctimonious avarice, in comparison of which, all the duties and dearnesses


which <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> owe to God or to his Church, to law, <span class="varspell" title="custom">custome</span>, or nature, <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> have


<span class="varspell" title="resolved">resolv'd</span> to set at <span class="varspell" title="naught">nought</span>. I could put you in mind what <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> <a href="" id="clement2" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Clement</span></a> a


fellow <span class="varspell" title="laborer">labourer</span> with the Apostles gave to the Presbyters of <span class="mi">Corinth,</span> whom
the


people though unjustly sought to remove. Who among you <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> he, is noble minded,


who is <span class="varspell" title="pitiful">pittifull</span>, who is charitable, let him say thus, if for me this sedition,


this enmity, these differences be, I willingly depart, I go my <span class="varspell" title="ways">wayes</span>, only let


the flock of Christ be at peace with the Presbyters that are set over it. He that


shall do this, <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> he, shall get him great <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> in the Lord, and all places

should depart rather from their just office, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by their stay, to <span class="varspell" title="ravel">ravle</span> out


the <span class="varspell" title="seamless">seamlesse</span> garment of concord in the Church. But I have better <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> to


give the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> more acceptable to their <span class="varspell" title="ears">eares</span>, this advice in my

<span class="msummary">That those many Sects and <span class="varspell" title="schisms">schismes</span> by some <span class="varspell" title="supposed">suppos'd</span> to be among us, and that


rebellion in </span> Ireland, <span class="mi"> ought not to be a hindrance, but a <span class="varspell" title="hastening">hastning</span> of
reformation. </span></p>




<p class="first">


<span class="varspell" title="As"><span class="minitial">A</span></span>s for those many Sects and
divisions <span class="varspell" title="rumored">rumor'd</span> abroad to be amongst us, it is not


hard to <span class="varspell" title="perceive">perceave</span> that they are partly the <span class="varspell" title="mere">meere</span> fictions and false <span class="varspell" title="alarms">alarmes</span> of the


Prelates, thereby to cast amazements and <span class="varspell" title="panic">panick</span> terrors into the hearts of weaker


Christians that they should not venture to change the present deformity of the


Church for fear of I know not what worse <span class="varspell" title="inconveniences">inconveniencies</span>. With the same objected


<span class="varspell" title="fears">feares</span> and suspicions, we know that <span class="varspell" title="subtle">suttle</span> <a href="" id="gardner" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Gardiner">Gardner</span></span></a> sought to divert
the


first reformation. It may suffice us to be taught by <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span class="mi">Paul</span> that there
<a href="" id="sects" class="annotBtn">must be sects</a> for the manifesting of those that are sound hearted. These are but winds


and flaws to try the <span class="varspell" title="floating">floting</span> <span class="varspell" title="vessel">vessell</span> of our faith whether it be stanch and


<span class="varspell" title="sail">sayl</span> well, whether our ballast be just, our anchorage and cable strong. By this


is <span class="varspell" title="seen">seene</span> who lives by faith and certain knowledge, and who by credulity and the


prevailing opinion of the age; whose <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> is of an unchangeable <span class="varspell" title="grain">graine</span>, and


whose of a slight wash. If God come to <span class="varspell" title="try">trie</span> our constancy we ought not to


shrink, or stand the <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> firmly for that, but <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> on with more <span class="varspell" title="steadfast">stedfast</span>


resolution to establish the truth though it were through a lane of sects and


heresies on each side. Other things men do to the glory of God: but sects and


errors it seems God suffers to be for the glory of good men, that the world may


know and reverence their true fortitude and undaunted constancy in the truth. Let


us not therefore make these things an <span class="varspell" title="encumbrance">incumbrance</span>, or an excuse of our delay in


reforming, which God sends us as an incitement to proceed with more <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> and


alacrity. For if there were no opposition where were the <span class="varspell" title="trial">triall</span> of an <span class="varspell" title="unfeigned">unfained</span>


<span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnesse</span> and magnanimity? <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span> that wavers is not <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, but vice revolted


from <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span>, and after <span class="varspell" title="awhile">a while</span> returning. The actions of just and pious men do


not darken in their middle course; but <a href="" id="solomon" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Solomon</span> <span class="varspell" title="tells">tels</span> us</a> they are as the
shining


light, that <span class="varspell" title="shines">shineth</span> more and more unto the <span class="varspell" title="perfect">perfet</span> day. But if we shall suffer the


trifling doubts and jealousies of future sects to <span class="varspell" title="over cloud">overcloud</span> the <span class="varspell" title="fair">faire</span> beginnings


of <span class="varspell" title="purposed">purpos'st</span> reformation, let us rather fear that <a href="" id="another" class="annotBtn">another proverb</a> of the same


Wiseman be not <span class="varspell" title="upbraided">upraided</span> to us, that the way of the wicked is as <span class="varspell" title="darkness">darknesse</span>, they


stumble at they know not what. If sects and <span class="varspell" title="schisms">schismes</span> be turbulent in the <span class="varspell" title="unsettled">unsetl'd</span> estate of a
Church, while it lies under the amending hand,


it best beseems our Christian courage to think they are but as the throws and


pangs that go before the birth of reformation, and that the work <span class="varspell" title="itself">it selfe</span> is now


in doing. For if we look but in the nature of <span class="varspell" title="elemental">elementall</span> and <span class="varspell" title="mixed">mixt</span> things, we


know they cannot suffer any change of one kind, or quality into another without


the <span class="varspell" title="struggle">struggl</span> of contrarieties. And in things <span class="varspell" title="artificial">artificiall</span>, <span class="varspell" title="seldom">seldome</span> any elegance is


wrought without a superfluous <span class="varspell" title="waste">wast</span> and refuse in the transaction. No Marble


statue can be politely <span class="varspell" title="carved">carv'd</span>, no fair edifice built without almost as much


rubbish and sweeping. Insomuch that even in the <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span> conflict of <span class="varspell" title="Saint">S.</span> <span
class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Paul's">Pauls</span></span>


conversion there fell <a href="" id="scales" class="annotBtn">scales from his eyes</a> that were not <span class="varspell" title="perceived">perceav'd</span> before. No


wonder then in the reforming of a Church which is never brought to effect without


the fierce encounter of truth and <span class="varspell" title="falsehood">falshood</span> together, if, as it were the


splinters and shares of so violent a jousting, there fall from between the


shock many fond errors and <span class="varspell" title="fanatic">fanatick</span> opinions, which when truth has the upper


hand, and the reformation shall be <span class="varspell" title="perfected">perfeted</span>, will easily be rid out of the way,


or kept so low, as that they shall be only the exercise of our knowledge, not the


disturbance, or interruption of our faith. As for that which<a href="" id="barclay" class="annotBtn"> <span class="mi">Barclay</span> ></a>in his


image of minds writes concerning the horrible and barbarous conceits of


Englishmen in their religion. I <span class="varspell" title="deem">deeme</span> it spoken like what <span class="varspell" title="he">hee</span> was, a fugitive


Papist traducing the <span class="varspell" title="Island">Iland</span> whence he sprung. It may be more judiciously <span class="varspell" title="gathered">gather'd</span>


from hence, that the Englishman of many other nations is least <span class="varspell" title="atheistic">atheisticall</span>, and


bears a <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> disposition of much reverence and awe towards the Deity; but in


his <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknesse</span> and want of better instruction, which among us too frequently is


neglected, especially by the meaner sort, turning the bent of his own wits with a


scrupulous and <span class="varspell" title="ceaseless">ceaselesse</span> care what he might do to <span class="varspell" title="inform">informe</span> <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> aright of God


and his worship, he may fall not unlikely sometimes as any otherland man into


an uncouth opinion. And verily if we look at his native <span class="varspell" title="towardliness">towardlinesse</span> in


the roughcast without breeding, some nation or other may haply be better


<span class="varspell" title="composed">compos'd</span> to a <span class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> civility, and right <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he. But if he get the


benefit once of a wise and well <span class="varspell" title="rectified">rectifi'd</span> nurture, which must first come in


<span class="varspell" title="general">generall</span> from the godly vigilance of the Church, I suppose that <span class="varspell" title="wherever">where ever</span>


mention is made of <span class="varspell" title="countries'">countries</span> manners, or men, the English people among the


first that shall be <span class="varspell" title="praised">prais'd</span>, may deserve to be accounted a right pious, right


honest, and right hardy nation. But thus while some stand dallying and deferring to


reform for fear of that which should mainly hasten them forward, lest schism and


error should <span class="varspell" title="increase">encrease</span>, we may now thank <span class="varspell" title="ourselves">our selves</span> and our <span class="varspell" title="delays">delayes</span> if instead of


schism a bloody and <span class="varspell" title="inhuman">inhumane</span> rebellion <span class="varspell" title="bestrikes">be strook</span> <span class="varspell" title="inbetween">in between</span> our slow movings.


Indeed against violent and <span class="varspell" title="powerful">powerfull</span> opposition there can be no just blame of a


<span class="varspell" title="lingering">lingring</span> dispatch. But this I urge against those that discourse it for a maxim,


as if the swift opportunities of establishing, or reforming religion, were to


attend upon the <a href="" id="fleam" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="phlegm">fleam</span></a> of state <span class="varspell" title="business">businesse</span>. In state many things at first are


crude and hard to digest, which only time and deliberation can <span class="varspell" title="supply">supple</span>, and


concoct. But in religion wherein is no immaturity, nothing out of season, it goes


<span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> otherwise. The <span class="varspell" title="door">doore</span> of grace <span class="varspell" title="turns">turnes</span> upon smooth hinges wide opening to send


out, but soon shutting to recall the precious offers of mercy to a nation: which


<span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="Watchfulness">Watchfulnesse</span> and <span class="varspell" title="Zeal">Zeale</span> two quick-sighted and ready-handed Virgins be


there in our <span class="varspell" title="behalf">behalfe</span> to <span class="varspell" title="receive">receave</span>, we <span class="varspell" title="lose">loose</span>: and still the ofter we <span class="varspell" title="lose">loose</span>, the


straiter the <span class="varspell" title="door">doore</span> opens, and the <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> is <span class="varspell" title="offered">offer'd</span>. This is all we get by


demurring in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> service. <span class="varspell" title="Tis">Tis</span> not rebellion that ought to be the hindrance of


reformation, but it is the want of this which is the cause of that. The <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>


which boast themselves the only bridlers of <span class="varspell" title="schism">schisme</span> God knows have been so cold


and backward both there and with us to <span class="varspell" title="repress">represse</span> <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> and idolatry, that


either through their <span class="varspell" title="carelessness">carelessenesse</span> or their craft all this <span class="varspell" title="mischief">mischiefe</span> is <span class="varspell" title="befallen">befaln</span>.


What can the <a href="" id="irish" class="annotBtn">Irish subject</a> do <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> just displeasure against us, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>


revenge upon English bodies the little care that our <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> have had of their


souls. Nor <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> their negligence been new in that <span class="varspell" title="Island">Iland</span> but ever notorious in


Queen <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Elizabeth's">Elizabeths</span></span> <span class="varspell" title="days">dayes</span>, as <a href="" id="camden" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Camden</span></a> their known
friend forbears not to complain.


Yet so little are they <span class="varspell" title="touched">toucht</span> with <span class="varspell" title="remorse">remorce</span> of these their cruelties, for these


cruelties are theirs, the bloody revenge of those souls which they have <span class="varspell" title="famished">famisht</span>, that whenas
against our brethren


the Scots, who by their upright and <span class="varspell" title="loyal">loyall</span> deeds have now bought themselves an


<span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> name to posterity, whatsoever malice by slander could invent, rage in


hostility attempt, they greedily attempted, toward these <span class="varspell" title="murderous">murdrous</span> Irish the


enemies of God and mankind, a cursed <span class="varspell" title="offspring">off-spring</span> of their own <span class="varspell" title="connivance">connivence</span>, no man


takes notice but that they <span class="varspell" title="seem">seeme</span> to be very <span class="varspell" title="calmly">calmely</span> and indifferently affected.


Where then should we begin to extinguish a rebellion that <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> his cause from the


mis-government of the Church, where? but at the <span class="varspell" title="Church's">Churches</span> reformation, and the


<span class="varspell" title="removal">removall</span> of that government which <span class="varspell" title="pursues">persues</span> and <span class="varspell" title="wars">warres</span> with all good Christians


under the name of <span class="varspell" title="schismatics">schismaticks</span>, but maintains and fosters all Papists and


Idolaters as tolerable Christians. And if the sacred Bible may be our light, we


are neither without example, nor the <span class="varspell" title="witness">witnesse</span> of God <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, that the corrupted


estate of the Church is both the cause of tumult, and <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span> <span class="varspell" title="wars">warres</span>, and that to


stint them, the peace of the Church must first be <span class="varspell" title="settled">setl'd</span>. <span class="mi">Now for a long
season,</span>


<span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> <a href="" id="azariah" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Azariah</span> to King <span class="mi">Asa,</span></a> <span class="mi">Israel
<span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">beene</span> without the true God, and without a


teaching Priest, and without law: and in those times there was no peace to him


that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the


inhabitants of the countries. And nation was <span class="varspell" title="destroyed">destroy'd</span> of nation, and City of


City, for God did vex them with all adversity. Be <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> strong therefore,</span> <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> he to


the reformers of that age, <span class="mi">and let not your hands be <span class="varspell" title="weak">weake</span>, for your <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> shall


<span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span> rewarded. </span>And in those Prophets that <span class="varspell" title="lived">liv'd</span> in the times of reformation after


the Captivity often <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> God <span class="varspell" title="stir">stirre</span> up the people to consider that while


establishment of Church matters was neglected, and put off, there was <span class="mi"><a href="" id="nopeace" class="annotBtn">no peace</a> to


him that went out or came in, for I</span>, <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> God, <span class="mi">had set all men every one
against


his <span class="varspell" title="neighbor">neighbour</span>.</span>  But from the very day forward that they went seriously, and


effectually about the welfare of the Church, <a href="" id="hetels" class="annotBtn">he <span class="varspell" title="tells">tels</span> them</a> that they themselves


might <span class="varspell" title="perceive">perceave</span> the sudden change of things into a prosperous and <span class="varspell" title="peaceful">peacefull</span>


condition. But it will here be said that the reformation is a long work, and the


miseries of <span class="mi">Ireland</span> are urgent of a speedy <span class="varspell" title="redress">redresse</span>. They be indeed; and
how


speedy we are, the <span class="varspell" title="poor">poore</span> afflicted remnant of our <span class="varspell" title="martyred">martyr'd</span> countrymen that sit


there on the <span class="varspell" title="Seashore">Sea-shore</span>, counting the <span class="varspell" title="hours">houres</span> of our delay with their sighs, and


the <span class="varspell" title="minutes">minuts</span> with their falling <span class="varspell" title="tears">teares</span>, perhaps with the <span class="varspell" title="distilling">destilling</span> of their bloody wounds, if they
have


not quite by this time cast off, and almost <span class="varspell" title="cursed">curst</span> the vain hope of our <span class="varspell" title="foundered">founder'd</span>


ships, and aids, can best judge how speedy we are to their <span class="varspell" title="relief">reliefe</span>. But let their


succors be hasted, as all need and reason is, and let not therefore the


reformation which is the chiefest cause of <span class="varspell" title="success">successe</span> and victory be still


procrastinated. They of the captivity in their greatest extremities could find


both <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> and hands <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> at once to build, and to expect the enemies


assault. And we for our parts a populous and mighty nation must needs be <span class="varspell" title="fallen">faln</span>


into a strange plight either of effeminacy, or confusion, if <span class="mi">Ireland</span> that
was


once the conquest of one single <span class="varspell" title="Earl">Earle</span> with his <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> forces, and the small


assistance of a <a href="" id="kernish" class="annotBtn">petty Kernish Prince</a>, should not take up all the <span class="varspell" title="wisdom">wisdome</span> and


<span class="varspell" title="prowess">prowesse</span> of this potent Monarchy to quell a barbarous crew of rebels, whom if we


take but the right course to subdue, that is beginning at the reformation of our


Church, their own horrid murders and rapes will so fight against them, that the


very <a href="" id="sutlers" class="annotBtn">sutlers</a> and horse <span class="varspell" title="boys">boyes</span> of the <span class="varspell" title="Camp">Campe</span> will be able to rout and chase them


without the staining of any Noble sword. To proceed by other method in this


<span class="varspell" title="enterprise">enterprize</span>, be our Captains and Commanders never so expert, will be as great an


error in the art of <span class="varspell" title="war">warre</span>, as any novice in <span class="varspell" title="soldiership">souldiership</span> ever committed.  And


thus I leave it as a declared truth, that neither the <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> of sects no nor


rebellion can be a fit plea to stay reformation, but rather to push it forward


with all possible diligence and speed.
