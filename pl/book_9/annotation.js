The idea that Eve could be sated with conjugal conversation, the purpose for which she was created (<a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#cling\" target=\"main\">4.440-49</a>), seems odd.  For his part, Adam said he could never get enough conversation with Raphael (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#raph_conversation\" target=\"main\">8.210-16</a>), for it made him feel \"in heaven\" (see <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Philippians+3&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Philippians 3</a>:20).</span>",

This means she has heard Raphael\'s parting warning to beware of passion\'s power over free will.  It seems less likely that we are meant to think she overheard Adam confess that the passion prompted by touching Eve\'s beauty makes him feel that Eve is superior to him (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#passion\" target=\"main\">8.530-559</a>), even though he knows she is not (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#eveinferior\" target=\"main\">8.540-546</a>), and she has heard Raphael\'s rebuke to Adam on this score (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#self_esteem\" target=\"main\">8.561-575</a>).

See <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#eveinferior\" target=\"main\">8.543-545</a> and Raphael\'s confirmation that Adam, not Eve, is the closest version of God\'s image.

"notreach":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>but could not reach</i>.  Birds, squirrels, and chipmunks are just a few animals that certainly could reach any fruit in a tree.  We may take this as evidence that the serpent is lying (he never did eat the fruit of that tree) and Eve should (shouldn\'t she?) notice the deceit.</span>",
"line599":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>to degree</i>.  Satan implies that the serpent first recieved a degree of mental reason, then the gift of speech.  Neither, of course, ever happened.  The serpent came by the appearance of reason and speech by, in a sense, swallowing Satan, not the fruit.</span>",

"line648":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Fruitless</i>.   An allusion to Spenser\'s similar pun on fruit and fruitless in  the <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/queene2.html#Cant.&nbsp;VII.\" target=\"Main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Faerie Queene</span> 2.7.55</a>.</span>",

"line680":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Science</i>.   Knowledge.</span>",
"line683":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>highest Agents</i>.   Perhaps a subtly ironic reference to Satan\'s own act of hubris. \"Highest Agents\" would be the highest angels or possibly God. This, especially followed by \"deem\'d however wise,\" would seem to highlight Satan\'s aspirations to godhead.  Satan here reminds one of the bombastic wizard in <span class=\"booktitle\">The Wizard of Oz,</span> with the addition of malice.</span>",

"removes":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>removes the feare</i>.  Serpentine logic.  The poem has a poor opinion of Eve\'s intellectual acuity, since she falls for this, combined with flattery that she detects but hardly resists.  See below: \"too easie entrance won\" (<a href=\"text.shtml#easie\" target=\"main\">735-39</a>).</span>",
"line711":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Internal Man</i>.  Satan implies that the serpent has become man internally but his physical features remain unchanged.  This is, of course, untrue.</span>",
"godfood":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>participating God-like food</i>.  This is, as Raphael suggested (<a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#discursive\" target=\"main\">5.496-501</a>), sort of true, but only if they remain \"obedient.\"  Eve cannot do that and eat from this tree.</span>",
"line722":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>If they</i>.  \"Produced\" is understood.</span>",

There is a pun here on the etymological meaning of sapience, \"taste\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#orgel\" target=\"main\">Orgel &amp; Goldberg</a>).  Eve now addresses the tree in language once reserved for addressing Adam or God.</span>",

"line825":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>inferior who is free?</i>   This line makes an interesting contrast to <a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#free\" target=\"main\"> 5.792-793</a>.  Again Milton puts familiar early feminist discourse into the mouth of a fallen being.</span>",

"agonie":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>agonie of love</i>.   Milton anticipates Eve\'s punishment.  According to <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+3&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 3</a>: 16, Eve\'s punishment is twofold: pain in childbirth and simultaneously to desire her husband.</span>",

"line864":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i> tasted</i>.   \"If\" is understood.</span>",
"line867":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>tasted</i>.   Proven by tasting.</span>",

"tedious":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Tedious, unshar\'d with thee</i>.   Eve apparently experiences the characteristically masculine desire for company for the first time.  See Adam\'s description of this lack in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#adamlack\" target=\"main\">8.363-366</a>.  In <span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span>, Milton tries to argue that Adam\'s desire for companionship is a desire for specifically female companionship, though not principally for sex (<a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#austin\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span> Genesis places</a>).</span>",
"last2":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>last and best</i>.  Human beings are the \"last and best\" creation; Adam may refer here  to Eve\'s loss of humanness, the loss of the image of God in her.  If we also hear him endorsing the early feminist notion that Eve was superior because created last, then he and the narrator are at odds; see <a href=\"#second\" target=\"notes\">above</a> and Milton\'s opinion on the matter in <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#himnotthem\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span></a>.</span>",
"line901":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>devote</i>.   Doomed.</span>",
"line914":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>bliss or woe</i>.  Echoes marriage vows: for better or for worse.   Milton makes the point clearly that Adam was not deceived, but instead made a choice in favor of Eve. Augustine outlined this distinction in (<span class=\"booktitle\">City of God</span> 12.11).  See also <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=1+Timothy+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">1 Timothy 2</a>: 14.</span>",

"oblige":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>oblige</i>.   Keeps its Latin force of \"involve in guilt.\" </span>",
"fact":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fact</i>.   Deed, crime.</span>",
"compliance":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>compliance bad</i>.  The narrator\'s condemnation of Adam\'s actions here seems clear, though many seasoned readers refuse to see it.  Admiring Adam for his love and devotion here is not an inaccurate response, but it is quite beside the point of the poem.</span>",
"line999":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Line 999</i>.  This line sums up  Adam\'s fall.  He understands reason but turns away from it in favor of the desires of the body, desires that Eve tries to ennoble with a discourse of sacrificial love.  What was earlier described as \"mysterious\" rites (<a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">4.741</a>), Adam now refers to as the \"Link\" or \"Bond of Nature\" (above <a href=\"text.shtml#naturelink\" target=\"main\">914</a> and <a href=\"text.shtml#naturebond\" target=\"main\">956</a>).  What was once a spiritual bond is now merely carnal: \"Flesh of flesh\" without mystery.   Milton is not known as a numerologist, but he depicts Adam\'s fall at line 999, an inversion of 666, the line in book 2 at which Milton introduces the character, Death--<a href=\"../book_2/text.shtml#othershape\" target=\"main\">2.666</a>.</span>",
"Lust":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>in Lust they burne</i>.  As opposed to the rational burning Milton defined in <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#rationalburn\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span> 1.4</a> and imagined in <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">4.742-49</a>.  </span>",

"line1037":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Lines 1037-1045</i>.   Similar to the scene between Zeus and Hera in <a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.270\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Iliad</span> 14.292-353</a>.</span>",

"line1050":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>unkindly</i>.   Unnatural.</span>",
"conscious":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>conscious</i>.   Guilty; conscious of error and sin.</span>",
"line1058":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>hee cover\'d</i>.   Echoes <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Psalms+6&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Psalm 6:10</a>: \"Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame.\"  See also <a href=\"../../samson/drama/text.shtml#shame\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> 841-42</a>.</span>",
"line1059":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Danite</i>.   Samson (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Judges+16&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Judges 16</a>) was a Danite who was betrayed by his Philistine lover Delilah when she cut off his hair, the secret source of his strength, and then delivered him to the Philistines.  The Samson simile at first invites us to think of Adam as a Samson figure, but the \"They\" of line 1062 makes both Adam and Eve appear Samson-like as they rise from post-coital sleep.  In his tragic drama <a href=\"../../samson/drama/text.shtml\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span></a> (1671), Milton imagines Dalila and Samson as wife and husband.</span>",
"line1092":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Line 1092</i>.   1674 switches the \"for\" of this line with the \"from\" of the next line; I have switched them back.</span>",
"obnoxious":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>obnoxious, and unseemliest</i>.  What now seem obnoxious and unseemly were once decribed as \"mysterious parts\" (<a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#parts\" target=\"main\">4.312</a>). This shift is in perfect analogy to their conjugal conversation, which was once \"Rites mysterious\" (<a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">4.743</a>) and now is \"Flesh of flesh.\"</span>",
"line1098":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Line 1098</i>.   1674 misprints a comma at the end of this line; I have changed it to a period.</span>",
"ficus":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>not that kind for Fruit</i>.   The lines appear to describe a banyan tree, but banyan leaves are not nearly large enough to be compared to Amazonian shields as in line 1111.  Perhaps banyan gets confused with banana?</span>",
"targe":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Amazonian Targe</i>.   Amazons\' shields.</span>",
"girt":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>th\' American so girt</i>.   Milton quite expectedly challenges the notion gaining popularity in his day that the New World natives are innocent like Adam in Eden, or noble upright savages.  Milton explicitly compares them to the newly-fallen, lust-driven, shameful Adam.</span>",
"sovran":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Usurping over sovran Reason</i>.  Milton reckons that this interior usurpation accounts for all tyrannous usurpations that follow throughout history.

"line1183":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Women</i>.   The accusatory tone makes this otherwise orthodox antifeminist remark sound mean and cruel, verging on the popular misogynist claim that women first brought sin into the world.  When Adam tries a similar line of talk in God\'s presence, he is rebuked by the more orthodox antifeminism of Milton\'s God (<a href=\"../book_10/text.shtml#thygod\" target=\"main\">10.146-156</a>).  Adam repeats an even stronger, more clearly misogynistic, version of this remark in conversation with the archangel Michael in book 11 and Michael takes care to distinguish the antifeminist principle of female inferiority from the misogynist slur that blames women in general for the advent of sin (<a href=\"../book_11/text.shtml#line630\" target=\"main\">11.632-36</a>). I use the word antifeminist here to mean \"a person who is hostile to sexual equality or to the advocacy of women\'s rights\" (<span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span>) even though it may appear to some an anachronistic usage.</p></div></body> </html> </span>"}
