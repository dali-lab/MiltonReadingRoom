var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i> Sonnet 14 was composed in memory of the death of Catherine Thomason, the  wife of the bookseller and collector <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=74062\" target=\"main\">George Thomason</a>.   Thomason collected more than 22,000 books and pamphlets printed between 1640 and 1660.  This collection is preserved in the British Library and known as the Thomason Tracts.  Milton intended the poem to comfort George Thomason and his eight children.  Milton assures the reader that those who truly believe in God will enjoy eternal salvation.  To illustrate this point, he evokes  images from the Book of Revelation.  When Milton published Sonnet 14 in 1673, readers could not identify the subject from the context of the poem.  However, in the Trinity Manuscript the scratched out title reads:</p><blockquote class=\"mcenter\">On y<span class=\"msuper\">e</span> religious memorie of M<span class=\"msuper\">rs</span> Catharine Thomason<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my christian freind deceas\'d 16 Decem.  1646</blockquote><p><span class=\"author\">Collin O\'Mara and Amar Dhand</span></span>",
