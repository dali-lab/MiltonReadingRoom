<p class="poemTitle">Introduction</p>

<p> John Milton composed "At a Vacation Exercise in the Colledge" to conclude his presentation
at Christ's College, Cambridge of <span class="booktitle">Prolusion VI</span>, a
formal oration in Latin supporting the proposition that "Sportive Exercises on
Occasion are not inconsistent with philosophical Studies." <span
class="booktitle">Prolusion VI</span> may have fulfilled Milton's BA graduation
requirement to participate in two disputations in the last two years of undergraduate
study or his later MA requirement to participate in three (<a href="../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#campbell_corns" target="main">Campbell and
Corns, <span class="booktitle">John Milton: Life, Work, and Thought</span> 35</a>).
The poem&mdash;an unorthodox apostrophe in English&mdash;would have concluded the traditional
Latin "Oratio" and the "Prolusio," a ludicrous lampoon of the College and its
students. </p>

<p class="next">Until 2008 most scholars accepted 1628 as the date of composition. 
The 1673 edition of <span class="booktitle">Poems &amp;c. Upon Several
Occasions</span> includes the preface "Anno Aetatis 19" and Milton was nineteen in
July 1628, the start of the summer vacation. This early date suggests a highly
precocious and advanced undergraduate. <a
href="../bibliography/i-k/text.shtml#william_kerrigan" target="main">William Kerrigan, John
Rumrich and Stephen Fallon</a> praise Milton for being "serious enough to be drafting
at age nineteen a life plan dedicated to . . . a noble epic subject, an answerable
style, a unique access to the divine secrets of the universe, and an enraptured
audience" (11). <a href="../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#barbara_lewalski"
target="main">Barbara Lewalski</a> calls the prolusion "remarkably advanced" (31).
</p>

<p class="next">Recently, Gordon Campbell and Thomas N. Corns, in their 2008
biography <a href="../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#campbell_corns"
target="main"><span class="booktitle">John Milton: Life, Work and Thought</span></a>
argue convincingly for a later date&mdash;the summer of 1631, when Milton was a
postgraduate student pursuing an M.A. (58-9). This later date is not certain but it
does promise to solve a few nagging problems. First, it is difficult to reconcile
Milton's "starring role" as "Father" of the vacation exercise with undergraduate
status. <a href="../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#shawcross_form">John T.
Shawcross</a> supports Campbell and Corns' dating by proposing that the line "all of
us Sophisters," which would require the poem's date be 1628, when Milton was a
sophister, has been mistranslated and should read "all our Sophisters." This
alternate translation thus "does not include him but calls upon many participants in
the exercise and in his audience. He is the 'Dictator' on this occasion, placing him,
it seems likely, in a superior position" (182 n1). Milton's appointment to this
starring role, Shawcross intimates, most likely results from a postgraduate
status.</p>

<p class="next">Campbell and Corns tread new territory, however, in their
investigations into the content of the prolusion itself. At the beginning, Milton
notes that the exercises had not been held the previous year, and Cambell and Corns
have found records only indicate the exercises were cancelled in 1630&mdash;due to the
plague. With regard to the prolusion's catalog of bird titles, moreover, the pair
investigated allusions to names of contemporary students, concluding that "the birds
only begin to flock in large numbers if the date of the prolusion is 1631" (59). </p>

<p class="next">Finally, <span class="booktitle">Prolusion VI</span>'s assertion that
Milton was appointed "Father" due to the abrupt departure of the original "leader and
commander of the Sophisters" can situate the poem within Milton's postgraduate career
at Cambridge. Suggesting that the leader was removed from his position due to his
participation in a prank, the prolusion describes a stunt in which fifty students
destroy an aqueduct, "laying siege to the town" and holding Barwell Field ransom with
thirst. Unable to find a corresponding record, Campbell and Corns conjecture that the
prolusion cites a drunken encounter of five students with the authorities of
Chesterton, a town near to Barwell Field, in April 1631 (59). Within this framework,
the aqueduct's destruction equates to a drunken tumble into King's Ditch and
urination in the river. Though their analysis mines profoundly for evidence, the
pair's finding have produced the only satisfactory historical foundation for the
story to date. </p>

<p class="next">The most recent analysis of "At a Vacation Exercise" is M.K.
Sugimura's 2009 book <a href="../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#n.k._sugimura"
target="main"><span class="booktitle">Matter of Glorious Trial: Spiritual and
Material Substance in Paradise Lost</span></a>, which favors Campbell and Corn's 1631
date. Given this contemporary critical inclination and Campbell and Corn's
persuasively detailed argument, we will assume Milton composed and delivered the poem
on 8 July 1631. </p>

<p class="next"><a href="../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#shawcross_form"
target="main">John T. Shawcross</a> supports Campbell and Corns' dating by proposing
that the line with which the pair most struggles&mdash;"all of us Sophisters," which would
require the poem's date be 1628, when Milton was a sophister&mdash;has been mistranslated
from the Latin and should read "all our Sophisters." This alternate translation thus
"does not include him but calls upon many participants in the exercise and in his
audience. He is the 'Dictator' on this occasion, placing him, it seems likely, in a
superior position" (182 n1). Milton's appointment to this high position, Shawcress
intimates, most likely results from a postgraduate station. </p>

<p class="next">Milton employed the power conferred upon him by his "Father" role to
embed an unlikely English poem into a pre-established "salting" tradition, which
ultimately portrays "At a Vacation Exercise" as a calculated act of self-promotion&mdash;a
promise for future attainment of new poetic heights. Preceding and accompanying "At a
Vacation Exercise," <span class="booktitle">Prolusion VI</span> would have adhered to
the tradition of the "salting" genre of oration, in which an undergraduate delivered
a speech subject to judgment by his classmates. "Salting" ruled that if the oratory
pleased its audience, the speaker earned a cup of spiced gruel; if it disappointed,
he would be presented a "salted" and unsavory drink. By the 1620s, Cambridge
University had developed its own particular salting practices, in which "a master of
ceremonies pretended to be a college tutor, and so became the 'father' of his 'sons,'
the new students" (Campbell and Corns, 60). A dialogue between "Father" and "son" of
a lewd and mildly insulting nature, Cambridge's salting humorously envisioned a mode
of interaction forbidden students and tutors by decorum and provided an unlikely
context for the eruption of claims to future poetic eminence that "At a Vacation
Exercise" entails. </p>

<p class="next">Resembling past and subsequent outbursts of augury, however, the
textual context in which "At a Vacation Exercise" anticipates Milton's future depicts
his evolving strategy for introducing himself as an English epic poet. As early as
1629 with <a href="../elegiarum/elegy_1/text.shtml" target="main"><span
class="booktitle">Elegy VI</span></a>, Milton aired his intention to become England's
"bardic Poet-Priest" (Lewalski, 38). Written in Latin and closely adhering to the
form of Latin elegies, Elegy VI adheres to the verse epistle format while expressing
desire to transcend the elegy's typical subjects and "sing the heaven-descended
king." We see signs of this ambition also in <a href="../nativity/text.shtml"
target="main"><span class="booktitle">On the Morning of Christ's Nativity</span></a>,
which Shawcross notes "cannot in its form be considered epical, though its substance
could be" (Shawcross, 339). </p>

<p class="next">Coming just two years after <span class="booktitle">On the Morning of
Christ's Nativity</span> according to the 1631 dating, "At a Vacation Exercise"
deviates radically from Latin poetic heritage to claim Milton's place for epic
canonization. Milton's intention that the poem prophesize his poetic destiny is
exemplified by its isolation as a singular work in Milton's second collection of
published work, the 1673 <span class="booktitle">Poems</span>. Within the collection,
"At a Vacation Exercise" is seemingly liberated from the Latin speaking exercise
bonds of its origin: the 1673 <span class="booktitle">Poems</span> places Milton's
English work before its Latin counterparts without apology. At this point in Milton's
career, "The poet of Paradise Lost needs and wants no introduction," Lewalski wryly
notes (505). Moreover, the collection foregrounds Milton's juvenile work, most of
which, like "At a Vacation Exercise," originated as a school exercise. Anthologizing
these early exercises in craft, the 1673 <span class="booktitle">Poems</span> appear
to proclaim the emancipation of these works from their original context, and to allow
them reflection as individual pieces deserving of further consideration.</p>

<p class="next">Within the 1673 <span class="booktitle">Poems</span>, "At a Vacation
Exercise" is placed between an English translation of <a
href="../fifth_ode/text.shtml" target="main">Book 1 of the Fifth Ode of Horace</a>
and <a href="../conscience/text.shtml" target="main">"On the New Forcers of
Conscience under the Long Parliament (1646)"</a>&mdash;both new in 1673. However, the
text's <span class="booktitle">Errata</span> notes that the "Vacation Exercise" was
misplaced and "should have come in" between <a href="../fair_infant/text.shtml"
target="main">"On the Death of a Fair Infant dying of a Cough"</a> and <a
href="../the_passion/index.shtml" target="main">"The Passion."</a> So organized, the
1673 <span class="booktitle">Poems</span> bolster Milton's projections of his future
as England's "bardic Poet-Priest" within "At a Vacation Exercise." The preceding
poem, "On the Death of a Fair Infant"&mdash;also first published in 1673 and probably
written in 1627-1628 (Campbell and Corns 27)&mdash;represents Milton's first attempt at a
classical Pindaric ode in English, according to <a
href="../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#revard_tangles" target="main">Stella Revard</a>.
"The Passion," which would have followed "At a Vacation Exercise," actualizes
authorial identity from an unfinished work. Accompanied by a note expressing Milton's
frustration over his inability to conclude his assignment&mdash;"This Subject the Author
finding to be above the yeers he had, when he wrote it, and nothing satisfi'd with
what was begun, left it unfinisht"&mdash;the poem is far from a gesture of humility.
Indeed, "The Passion" materializes the author so thoroughly that it transforms the
poem into a meditation on Milton's writing process, "a poem about Milton trying to
work up the proper emotions to write a Passion poem" (Revard 38). Placing "At a
Vacation Exercise" between poems that fashion Milton's identity as a fundamentally
English poet, the 1673 <span class="booktitle">Poems</span>' original formation
weaves the poem into a narrative of a national poet coming into his full powers. </p>

<p class="next">Like <span class="booktitle">Elegy VI</span> strategically bursts
with epic intent inside a non-epic genre, "At a Vacation Exercise" further expands
upon the initial prophecy of the verse epistle by addressing a larger audience.
Milton's sudden eruption into "At a Vacation Exercise"&mdash;which proclaims he has "some
naked thoughts that rove about / And loudly knock to have their passage out" (<a
href="../vacation/text.shtml#line20" target="text">23-24</a>)&mdash;uses the prolusion's
opportunity to address a large group of collegiate peers. One only wonders what
Milton's peers must have made of his bold entry into English beginning with the
apostrophe "Hail Native language" after having listened to lewd farting and sex jokes
from the "Prolusio." Milton's syntax produces this departure in English as a brief
moment of frank communication between author and listener. After representing the
English language as a wardrobe in an extended metaphor in the first stanza, Milton
strips his language of poetic devices in the middle of the poem and admits, "Yet had
I rather, if I were to chuse, / Thy service in some graver subject use" (<a
href="../vacation/text.shtml#line25" target="text">28-30</a>). England's native
tongue, the poet suggests, is full of sartorial treasures or "richest Robes" that can
be employed to greater ends perhaps even than in Latin (<a
href="../vacation/text.shtml#line20" target="text">21</a>). Milton turns the
"salting" exercise on itself, using the opportunity it allows him to address his
acaemic audience to mock the scholastic tradition: instead of making a "graver
subject" of their own language, English schoolboys insult each other in Latin.
However much the preceding Prolusion may have amused its Cambridge audience, "At a
Vacation Exercise" reveals the rhetorical wealth and potential of the English
language, as much as it does Milton himself. </p>

<p class="next">"At a Vacation Exercise" prepares England, then, for Milton's later,
grand announcement of his resolution to be his country's epic poet in <a
href="../reason/book_1/text.shtml" target="main"><span class="booktitle">Reason of
Church Government Urg'd against Prelaty</span></a>. Presumed to have been written in
1641&mdash;though its allusion to imprisonment of bishops may situate its composition in
1642, the year it was published (Campbell and Corns, 146)&mdash;<span
class="booktitle">Reason of Church Government</span> would have been available for
mass purchase and its syntax accordingly is "aimed at the general reader, not the
expert" (<a href="../bibliography/a-b/text.shtml#douglas_bush" target="main">Douglas Bush</a>, 739). Milton used the opportunity to include a "personal digression"
in the Preface to Book II that projects his destiny to craft epics "adorning my
native tongue" for the common Englishman he addresses.</p>

<p class="next">Ultimately, <span class="booktitle">Paradise Lost</span> can be seen
to conclude Milton's narrative of self-presentation and realize the yearning for
poetic purpose proposed by "At a Vacation Exercise." In "At a Vacation Exercise,"
Donald Friedman sees a promise fulfilled in Book 1 of <span
class="booktitle">Paradise Lost</span>. Friedman writes, </p>

<blockquote>In one sense, then, the beginning of Paradise Lost announces the end of a
very long phase of Milton's education.&hellip; As always in Milton, the end of wisdom
is action; the ultimate and only fitting result of the long maturation, the
victory over 'the perpetuall stumble and conjecture and disturbance in this
oure dark voyage,' is something done, in the service 'intirely reasonable'
enjoined upon the poet by God and by his own awareness of his singular skills
and observations.<br />(<a href="../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#donald_friedman"
target="main">"Harmony and the Poet's Voice in Some of Milton's Early Poems"
524</a>)</blockquote>

<p> In "At a Vacation Exercise," Milton seeks a topic worthy of the
"action" he deems a suitable dénouement to his canonization. Remarkably, by
inscribing his desire to "at Heav'ns dore / Look in, and see each blissful Deitie"
(<a href="../vacation/text.shtml#line30" target="text">34-35</a>) and to "sing of
secret things that came to pass
/ When Beldam Nature in her cradle was" (<a
href="../vacation/text.shtml#line45" target="text">45-46</a>), "At a Vacation
Exercise" acts as a belated preface to the poetic explorations of the 1667 <span
class="booktitle">Paradise Lost</span>.</p>

<p class="next">"At a Vacation Exercise" depicts Milton's early awareness of his
skills and calling, and, as a result, proposes a challenge he will rise to meet. "At
a Vacation Exercise" therefore consciously instills narrative within the history of
Milton's development as a poet, and ultimately defines its conclusion in <span
class="booktitle">Paradise Lost</span> as "the end of wisdom" (Friedman, 524). </p>
