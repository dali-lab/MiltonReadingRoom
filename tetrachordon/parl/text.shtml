<b>To the PARLAMENT</b></br>

<p>
That which I knew to be the part of a good Magistrate, 
aiming at true liberty through the right information 
of religious and civil life, and that which I saw, and 
was partaker, of your Vows and <a href="" id="Covenants" class="annotBtn">solemne Cov'nants</a>, 
<span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> of England, your actions also manifestly 
tending to exalt the truth, and to depress the 
tyranny of error, and ill custome, with more  
constancy and prowesse then ever yet any, since that 
 <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> which put the first Scepter of this  
Kingdom into his hand whom God and extraordinary  
vertue made thir Monarch, were the causes that  
mov'd me, one else not placing much in the eminence 
 of a dedication, to present your high notice with a 
 Discourse, conscious to it self of nothing more then 
of  
diligence, and firm affection to the publick good.  And 
that ye took it so as wise and impartial men,  
obtaining so great power and dignitie, are wont to  
accept, in matters both doubtfull and important, what 
they think offer'd them well meant, and from a  
rational ability, I had no lesse then to perswade me. 
And on that perswasion am return'd, as to a famous  
and free Port, my self also bound by more then a  
<i>maritime</i> Law, to expose as freely what fraughtage I 
conceave to bring of no trifles.  For although it be 
generally known, how and by whom ye have been  
instigated to a hard censure of that former book  
entitl'd, The Doctrine, and Discipline of Divorce, an 
opinion held by some of the best among reformed  
Writers without scandal or confutement, though now  
thought new and dangerous by some of our severe
<a href="" id="Gnostics" class="annotBtn"><i>Gnostics</i></a>, whose little reading, and less meditating 
holds ever with hardest obstinacy that which it took 
up with easiest credulity, I do not find yet that  
ought, for the furious incitements which have been  
us'd, hath issu'd by your appointment, that might  
give the least interruption or disrepute either to the 
Author, or to the Book.  Which he who will be better 
advis'd then to call your neglect, or connivance at 
a  
thing imagin'd so perilous, can attribute it to nothing 
more justly, then to the deep and quiet stream of  
your direct and calme deliberations; that gave not  
way either to the fervent rashnesse, or the  
immaterial gravity of those who ceas'd not to  
exasperate without cause.  For which uprightnesse  
and incorrupt refusall of what ye were incens'd to,  
Lords and Commons, (though it were don to justice, 
not to me, and was a peculiar demonstration how farre 
your waies are different from the rash vulgar)  
besides those allegiances of oath and duty, which are 
my public debt to your public labours, I have yet a 
store of gratitude laid up, which cannot be  
exhausted; and such thanks perhaps they may live to 
be, as shall more then whisper to the next ages.  Yet 
that the Author may be known to ground himself  
upon his own innocence, and the merit of his cause, 
not upon the favour of a diversion, or a delay to any 
just censure, but wishes rather he might see those  
<a name="palmer">his detracters</a> at any fair meeting, as learned  
debatements are privileg'd with a due freedom under 
equal Moderators, I shall here briefly single <a href="" id="palmer" class="annotBtn">one of them</a> (because he hath oblig'd me to it) who I  
perswade me having scarse read the book, nor  
knowing him who writ it, or at least faining the  
latter, hath not forborn to scandalize him,  
unconferr'd with, unadmonisht, undealt with by  
any Pastorly or brotherly convincement, in the most 
open and invective manner, and at the most bitter  
opportunity that drift or set design could have  
invented.  And this, when as the Canon Law, though  
commonly most favouring the boldnesse of their  
Priests, punishes the naming or traducing of any  
person in the Pulpit, was by him made no scruple.  If 
I shall therfore take licence by the right of nature, 
and that liberty wherin I was born, to defend my self 
publicly against a printed Calumny, and do willingly 
appeal to those Judges to whom I am accus'd, it can 
be no immoderate, or unallowable course of seeking  
so just and needful reparations.  Which I had don  
long since, had not these employments, which are  
now visible, deferr'd  me.  It was preacht before ye, 
Lords and Commons, in August  last upon a special  
day of humiliation, that <i>there was a wicked Book  
abroad</i>, and ye were taxt of sin that it was yet  
<i>uncensur'd, the book deserving to be burnt</i>, and  
<i>impudence</i> also was charg'd upon the Author, who  
durst <i>set his name to it, and dedicate it to your  
selves</i>.  First, Lords and Commons, I pray to that God, 
before whom ye then were prostrate, so to forgive ye 
those omissions and trespasses, which ye desire most 
should find forgiveness, as I shall soon shew to the 
world how easily ye absolve your selves of that  
which this man calls your sin, and is indeed your  
wisdom, and your Noblenesse, wherof to this day ye  
have don well not to repent.  He terms it <i>a wicked 
book</i>, and why but <i>for allowing other causes of  
Divorce, then Christ and his Apostles mention</i>; and  
with the same censure condemns of wickedness not  
onely <i>Martin Bucer</i> that elect Instrument of  
Reformation, highly honour'd and had in reverence  
by <i>Edward</i> the sixth, and his whole <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, whom  
also I had published in English by a good providence, 
about a week before this calumnious digression was  
preach'd; so that if he knew not <i>Bucer</i> then, as he  
ought to have known, he might at least have known  
him some months after, ere the Sermon came in  
print, wherin notwithstanding he persists in his  
former sentence, and condemnes again of wickedness,  
either ignorantly or wilfully, not onely <i>Martin Bucer</i>, 
and all the choisest and holiest of our Reformers, but 
the whole <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> and Church of England in those  
best and purest times of <i>Edward</i> the sixth.  All which 
I shall prove with good evidence, at the end of those 
Explanations.  And then let it be judg'd and seriously 
consider'd with what hope the affairs of our Religion 
are committed to one among others, who hath now  
onely left him which of the twain he will choose,  
whether this shall be his palpable ignorance, or the 
same wickedness of his own book, which he so  
lavishly imputes to the writings of other men: and  
whether this of his, that thus peremptorily defames 
and attaints of wickedness unspotted Churches,  
unblemisht <span class="varspell" title="Parliaments">Parlaments</span>, and the most eminent  
restorers of Christian Doctrine, deserve not to be  
burnt first.  And if his heat had burst out onely  
against the opinion, his wonted passion had no doubt 
bin silently born with wonted patience.  But since, 
against the charity of that solemne place and meeting, 
it serv'd him furder to inveigh opprobriously  
against the person, branding him with no lesse then  
impudence, onely for setting his name to what he had 
writt'n; I must be excus'd not to be so wanting to the 
defence of an honest name, or to the reputation of  
those good Men who afford me their society, but to be 
sensible of such a foule endeavour'd disgrace: not  
knowing ought either in mine own deserts, or the  
Laws of this Land, why I should be subject, in such 
a  
notorious and illegal manner, to the intemperancies  
of this mans preaching choler.  And indeed to be so 
prompt and ready in the midst of his humblenesse, to 
tosse reproaches of this bulk and size, argues as if 
they were the weapons of his exercise, I am sure not 
of his Ministry, or of that dayes work.  Certainly to 
subscribe my name at what I was to own, was what  
the State had order'd and requires.  And he who lists 
not to be malicious, would call it ingenuity, cleer 
conscience, willingness to avouch what might be  
question'd, or to be better instructed.  And if God 
were so displeas'd with those, <a href="" id="verse4" class="annotBtn"><i>Isa</i>. 58.</a>  who <i>on the  
solemne fast were wont to smite with the fist of  
wickednesse</i>, it could be no sign of his own humiliation 
accepted, which dispos'd him to smite so keenly with 
a reviling tongue.  But if onely to have writ my name 
must be counted impudence, how doth this but  
justifie another, who might affirm with as good  
warrant, that the late Discourse of <i>Scripture and  
Reason</i>, which is certain to be chiefly his own  
draught, was publisht without a name, out of base  
fear, and the sly avoidance of what might follow to 
his detriment, if the party at Court should hap to  
reach him. And I, to have set my name, where he  
accuses me to have set it, am so far from recanting, 
that I offer my hand also if need be, to make good the 
same opinion which I there maintain, by inevitable  
consequences drawn parallel from his own principal  
arguments in that of <i>Scripture and Reason</i>: which I  
shall pardon him, if he can deny, without shaking his 
own composition to peeces.  The <i>impudence</i> therfore, 
since he waigh'd so little what a grosse revile that 
was  
to give his equall, I send him back again for a  
<i>phylactery</i> to stitch upon his arrogance, that  
censures not onely before conviction so bitterly  
without so much as one reason giv'n, but censures  
the Congregation of his Governors to their faces, for 
not being so hasty as himself to censure.
</p>

<p>And wheras my other crime is, that I address'd  
the Dedication of what I had studied, to the  
<span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, how could I better declare the loyalty  
which I owe to that supreme and majestick Tribunal,  
and the opinion which I have of the high-entrusted  
judgment, and personall worth assembl'd in that  
place.  With the same affections therfore, and the  
same addicted fidelity, <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> of England, I here 
 
again have brought to your perusal on the same  
argument these following Expositions of Scripture.  
 
The former book, as pleas'd some to think, who were 
 
thought judicious, had of reason in it to a sufficiencie; 
 
what they requir'd, was that the Scriptures there  
alleg'd might be discuss'd more fully.  To their  
desires, thus much furder hath been labour'd in the 
 
Scriptures.  Another sort also who wanted more  
autorities, and citations, have not been here  
unthought of.  If all this attain not to satisfie them, 
as  
I am confident that none of those our great  
controversies at this day, hath had a more  
demonstrative explaining, I must confesse to admire  
what it is; for doubtlesse it is not reason now adayes 
 
that satisfies, or suborns the common credence of  
men, to yeeld so easily, and grow so vehement in  
matters much more disputable, and farre lesse  
conducing to the daily good and peace of life.  Some 
 
whose necessary shifts have long enur'd them to  
cloak the defects of their unstudied yeers, and  
hatred now to learn, under the appearance of a  
grave solidity, which estimation they have gain'd  
among weak perceivers, find the ease of slighting  
what they cannot refute, and are determin'd, as I  
hear, to hold it not worth the answering.  In which 
 
number I must be forc'd to reck'n <a href="" id="Doctor" class="annotBtn">that Doctor</a>, who  
in a late equivocating Treatise plausibly set afloat 
 
against the <i>Dippers</i>, diving the while himself with a 
 
more deep prelatical malignance against the present 
 
state, &amp; Church-government, mentions with  
ignominy <i>the Tractate of Divorce</i>; yet answers  
nothing, but instead therof (for which I do not  
commend his marshalling) sets <i>Moses</i> also among the  
crew of his Anabaptists, as one who to a holy Nation, 
 
the Commonwealth of Israel, gave Laws <i>breaking the  
bonds of mariage to inordinate lust</i>.  These are no 
 
mean surges of blasphemy, not onely <i>dipping Moses</i>  
the divine Lawgiver, but dashing with a high hand  
against the justice and purity of God himself; as  
these ensuing Scriptures plainly and freely handl'd 
 
shall verifie to the launcing of that old <a href="" id="apostemated" class="annotBtn"><i>apostemated</i></a>  
 
error.  Him therefore I leave now to his repentance.</p>

  <p>Others, which is their courtesie, confesse that wit  
and parts may do much to make that seem true  
which is not (as was objected to <i>Socrates</i> by them  
who could not resist his efficacy, that he ever made 
 
the worse cause seem the better) and thus thinking  
themselves discharg'd of the difficulty, love not to 
 
wade furder into the fear of a convincement.  These 
 
will be their excuses to decline the full examining 
of  
this serious point.  So much the more I presse it and 
 
repeat it, Lords and Commons, that ye beware while  
time is, ere this grand secret, and onely art of  
ignorance affecting tyrany, grow powerful, and rule 
 
among us.  For if sound argument and reason shall be 
 
thus put off, either by an undervaluing silence, or 
 
the maisterly censure of a rayling word or two in the 
 
Pulpit, or by rejecting the force of truth, as the meer 
 
cunning of eloquence and Sophistry, what can be the 
 
end of this, but that all good learning and knowledge 
 
will suddenly decay:  Ignorance, and illiterate  
presumption, which is yet but our disease, will turn 
 
at length into our very constitution, and prove the  
<i>hectic</i> evill of this age: worse to be fear'd, if it get 
 
once to reign over us, then any <a href="" id="fifth" class="annotBtn">fift Monarchy</a>.  If 
 
this shall be the course, that what was wont to be a 
 
chief commendation, and the ground of other mens  
confidence in an Author, his diligence, his learning, 
 
his elocution whether by right, or by ill meaning  
granted him, shall be turn'd now to a disadvantage  
and suspicion against him, that what he writes,  
though unconfuted, must therfore be mistrusted,  
therfore not receiv'd for the industry, the exactnesse, 
 
the labour in it, confess'd to be more then ordnary; 
 
as if wisdome had now forsak'n the thirstie and  
laborious inquirer to dwell against her nature with 
 
the arrogant and shallow babler, to what purpose all 
 
those pains and that continual searching requir'd of 
 
us by <i>Solomon</i> to the attainment of understanding;  
why are men bred up with such care and expence to  
a life of perpetual studies, why do your selves with 
 
such endeavour seek to wipe off the imputation of  
intending to discourage the progresse and advance of 
 
learning?  He therfore whose heart can bear him to  
the high pitch of your noble enterprises, may easily 
 
assure himself that the prudence and farre-judging  
circumspectnesse of so grave a Magistracy sitting in 
 
<span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, who have before them the prepar'd and  
purpos'd Act of their most religious predecessors to 
 
imitate in this question, cannot reject the cleerness 
 
of these reasons, and these allegations both here and 
 
formerly offer'd them; nor can over-look the  
necessity of ordaining more wholesomly and more  
humanly in the casualties of Divorce, then our Laws 
 
have yet establisht: if the most urgent and  
excessive grievances hapning in domestick life, be  
worth the laying to heart, which, unlesss Charity be 
 
farre from us, cannot be neglected.  And that these  
things both in the right constitution, and in the right 
 
reformation of a Common-wealth call for speediest  
redresse, and ought to be the first consider'd, anough 
 
was urg'd in what was prefac'd to that monument of  
<i>Bucer</i> which I brought to your remembrance, and  
the other time before.  Henceforth, except new cause 
 
be giv'n, I shall say lesse and lesse.  For if the Law 
 
make not timely provision, let the Law, as reason is, 
 
bear the censure of those consequences, which her  
own default now more evidently produces.  And if  
men want manlinesse to expostulate the right of their 
 
due ransom, and to second their own occasions, they 
 
may sit hereafter and bemoan themselves to have  
neglected through faintnesse the only remedy of their 
 
sufferings, which a seasonable and well-grounded  
speaking might have purchas'd them.  And perhaps  
in time to come, others will know how to esteem what 
 
is not every day put into their hands, when they  
have markt events, and better weigh'd how hurtfull  
and unwise it is, to hide a secret and pernicious  
rupture under the ill counsell of a bashful silence.  But 
 
who would distrust ought, or not be ample in his  
hopes of your wise and Christian determinations?  
who have the prudence to consider, and should have  
the goodnesse <a href="" id="Gods" class="annotBtn">like gods, as ye are call'd</a>, to find out 
 
readily, and by just Law to administer those  
redresses which have of old, not without God  
ordaining, bin granted to the adversities of  
mankind, ere they who needed, were put to ask.   
Certainly, if any other have enlarg'd his thoughts to 
 
expect from this Government so justly undertak'n,  
and by frequent assistances from heaven so  
apparently upheld, glorious changes and renovations 
 
both in Church and State, he among the formost  
might be nam'd, who prays that the fate of England  
may tarry for no other Deliverers.</p>

John Milton.
