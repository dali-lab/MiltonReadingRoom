"samson":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>M D C L X X I.</i>  <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> appeared in 1671, published in the same book with with <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span>.  The title page of <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span> reads in part \"<span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span> . . . to which is added <span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span>.\"  Arguments about the date of composition tend recently to favor a later date, close to the publication, though like <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regained</span>, the poem may have been started much earlier. <span lang=\"la\">Agonistes</span> means both an actor and a combatant or struggler.  The story is based on the biblical narrative of Samson in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Judges+13&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Judges 13-16</a>.</p></div></body> </html> </span>"}
