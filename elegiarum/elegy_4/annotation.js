"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>.  Thomas Young was Milton\'s private tutor from as early as 1618 when he first came to London and probably continued as such while Milton attended St. Paul\'s school until about 1620.  He was born at Luncarty in Perthshire, Scotland in 1588, and educated at Perth Grammar School and the University of St. Andrews, proceeding M.A. in 1606.  A Scottish Puritan, he pastored a congregation of English merchants in Hamburg from about 1620 until 1628 when he returned to England to pastor the church at Stowmarket in Suffolk.</p><p class=\"next\">In 1639 Young published <span class=\"booktitle\">Dies Dominica</span> in defence of Puritan views on Sabbath observance.  In 1642 he was a member of the Westminster Assembly; when Cambridge was purged of royalists and Laudians in 1644, he was appointed Master of Jesus College, a post he held until the restoration of royalists in 1660.  He died in Stowmarket in 1665.</p><p class=\"next\">Young was part of the group of Puritan divine who composed <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/63410\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">An Answer to a Book Entitled \"An Humble Remonstrance\"</span></a> (1641) under the pseudonym of <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=1281\" target=\"main\">Smectymnuus</a>. His name is represented by the \"ty\"; the others were Steven Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Matthew Newcomen, and William Spurstowe.  This pamphlet replied energetically to Bishop Hall\'s defence of episcopacy.  Milton later weighed in on the side of his friend and tutor with his <span class=\"booktitle\">Animadversions upon the Remonstrant\'s Defence against Smectymnuus</span> (1641), and <span class=\"booktitle\">An Apology for Smectymnuus</span> (1642).</p><p class=\"next\">The date of this poem has prompted quite a bit of dispute.

If the sun has passed through the sign of the Ram (Aires March 21-April 20) three times since Thomas Young left England, and Milton is writing in the early spring of 1627 (Chloris has sown only twice and Auster harvested only twice), then the poem indicates that Young left England for Hamburg in the fall or winter of 1624-25.  However, Young probably moved to Hamburg as early as 1622.  Perhaps Milton is simply referring to the date he left St. Paul\'s school for Cambridge, rather than the date Young actually departed England.</span>",
