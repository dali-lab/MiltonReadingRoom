var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i> In Sonnet 2, we learn the name of lady described in several of Milton\'s Italian sonnets: Emilia. There is some debate over whether Emilia is actually Italian or an English friend of Milton and Charles Diodati, who, like Diodati, had an Italian parent. However, from Sonnet 4 we learn that she posseses an exotic, dark beauty, and speaks a foreign tongue, most likely Italian. Whereas Sonnet 4 praises Emilia\'s beauty in anti-Petrarchan terms (dark beauty rather than fair skin and rosy cheeks), Sonnet 2 praises Emilia in ways much more typical of sixteenth-century love lyrics. Milton uses common imagery and allusions, such as Emilia\'s eyes bearing the power of Cupid\'s bow, and her irresistibly beautiful voice posing a danger to men. This sonnet and Sonnet 6 finish with a pair of tercets, having the rhyme scheme of cdc, dce. Another poet well known for using tercets this way was Petrarch, who has an obvious influence on this sonnet as well as on Milton\'s  other five Italian lyrics in this group. <span class=\"author\">Meredith Russo and Thomas H.
