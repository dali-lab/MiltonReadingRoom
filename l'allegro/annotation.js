var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction.</i> It is nearly impossible to understand and appreciate John Milton\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">L\'Allegro</span> without also having read its companion piece, <span class=\"booktitle\">Il Penseroso</span>.  Whereas l\'allegro is \"the happy person\" who spends an idealized day in the country and a festive evening in the city, il penseroso is \"the thoughtful person\" whose night is filled with meditative walking in the woods and hours of study in a \"lonely Towr.\"  First published in <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/60223/22\" target=\"main\">1645</a>, the two poems complement each other structurally and contain images which are in specific dialogue with one another.</p><p class=\"next\">In 1983, Gerard H. Cox wrote that \"it is obvious that <span class=\"booktitle\">L\'Allegro</span> and <span class=\"booktitle\">Il Penseroso</span> are companion poems, but precisely how and why they are related remains an open question\" (<a href=\"../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#gerard_cox\" target=\"main\">Cox</a> 45).  Over the years, scholars have suggested a wide range of connections between the two.  To some, the poems represent a battle between Day and Night/Mirth and Melancholy (<a href=\"../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#tillyard_setting\" target=\"main\">Tillyard</a> 1); to others, opposing paths (of pleasure and wisdom) toward complete union with God (<a href=\"../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#gerard_cox\" target=\"main\">Cox</a> 58); and to still others, Milton\'s own struggle to become a \"whole\" man and a truly great poet (<a href=\"../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#zacharias\" target=\"main\">Zacharias</a> 6).  Roy Flannagan even suggests that L\'Allegro is the light-hearted Charles Diodati and Il Penseroso is the studious Milton (<a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#Flannagan\" target=\"main\">Flannagan</a> 65).  Certainly, there is evidence of this in Milton\'s letter to his dear friend when he writes:</p><blockquote>it is in my favor that your habit of studying permits you to pause frequently, visit friends, write much, and sometimes make a journey.  But my temperament allows no delay, no rest, no anxiety &mdash; or at least thought &mdash; about scarcely anything to distract me, until I attain my object and complete some great period, as it were, of my studies. (<a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#Flannagan\" target=\"main\">Flannagan</a> 1051)</blockquote><p class=\"next\">Almost every critic agrees, however, that  \"[w]hat one poem twists, the other untwists\" in an unending cycle of what might be called \"dissonant companionship\" (<a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#finch\" target=\"main\">Finch and Bowen</a> 18).  Abandoning Latin for simple  English in these twinned poems, Milton borrows greatly from such English poets as Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson, and he looks directly to Edmund Spenser\'s <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/fqintro.html\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Faerie Queene</span></a> and William Shakespeare\'s <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Shakespeare/midsummer/index.html\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A Midsummer Night\'s Dream</span></a> for pastoral descriptions of hobgoblins and fairies.  The pair of poems should be read aloud in order  fully to appreciate their complementary sounds; <span class=\"booktitle\">L\'Allegro</span>\'s lilting pitch and images of crowing roosters and singing larks deeply contrasts with <span class=\"booktitle\">Il Penseroso\'s</span> somber tone and \"Belmans drousie charm.\"</p><p class=\"next\">The copytext for this edition of <span class=\"booktitle\">L\'Allegro</span> is a copy of Milton\'s 1645 <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span> owned by Rauner Library at Dartmouth College (Hickmott 172).<br />  <span class=\"author\">Jennifer Hickey</span></span>",

"euphrosyne":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Euphrosyne.</i> The Goddess of Mirth. As one of the three graces &mdash; Euphrosyne (Mirth), Aglaia (Brightness) and Thalia (Bloom) &mdash; she is typically thought of as the daughter of Zeus and Eurynome (<a href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:901\" target=\"main\">Hesoid\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Theogony</span> 907-11</a>). Here, however, Milton makes her the daughter of Venus (goddess of love and beauty) and Bacchus (god of wine), technically making Mirth Comus\'s half-sister (<a href=\"../comus/text.shtml#bacchus\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask</span> 46-58</a>).

"zephirwithaurora":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Zephir with Aurora.</i> This alternate ancestry of Euphrosyne makes her the daughter of the west wind and the dawn. As Roy Flannagan suggests, Milton may be saying that accurately tracing Mirth\'s origin is not important: \"getting there is all the fun, in the sense that the begetting of Mirth must be joyful and guilt-free\" (<a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#Flannagan\" target=\"main\">Flannagan</a> 66).</span>",
"filldher":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Fill\'d her.</i> Begot, as if he were breathing wind into her. Gerald Cox connects this act with poetic inspiration and writes, \"Euphrosyne affords man the inspiration to transform himself and so reach a higher level of being\" (<a href=\"../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#gerard_cox\" target=\"main\">Cox</a> 48) In other words, Mirth will awaken man to his joyful potential.</span>",

"trip":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>trip...toe.</i> Here, \"trip\" means to step or dance full of life and vigor; \"fantastic,\" fancifully imagined.

(<a href=\"../penseroso/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">31-32</a>, <a href=\"../penseroso/text.shtml#line35\" target=\"main\">37-8</a>)</blockquote><p>Many scholars point out the resemblance to Ariel\'s words in Shakespeare\'s <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Shakespeare/tempest/tempest.4.1.html\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Tempest</span> 4.1</a>.44-47.</span>",

"lark":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Lark.</i> The counterpart to <span class=\"booktitle\">Il Penseroso</span>\'s nightingale; traditionally the first bird to sing in the morning. Gerald H. <a href=\"../bibliography/c-e/text.shtml#gerard_cox\" target=\"main\">Cox</a> notes that in his <span class=\"booktitle\">Second Prolusion</span> Milton writes:</p><blockquote>Why, it is quite credible that the lark herself soars up into the clouds at dawn and that the nightingale passes the night in solitary trilling in order to harmonize their songs with that heavenly music to which they studiously listen.</blockquote><p></span>",
"bidgoodmorrow":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Bid good morrow.</i> There has been some disagreement over who comes to the window to \"bid good morrow.\" While critics have suggested Mirth, the Lark, and the Dawn, most editorial opinion supports L\'Allegro himself.

The fact that <span class=\"booktitle\">L\'Allegro</span> and <span class=\"booktitle\">Il Penseroso</span> are in dialogue (conversation) with each other furthers this theme, as Milton believed the chief purpose of marriage was conversation (<a href=\"../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#conversation\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span> 1.2</a>).</span>",

Graves believed the lines belonged after line 114, which would make the action clearer. Fish, however, strongly disagrees and insists that Milton purposely did not want a clear plot line (<a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#fish_allegro\" target=\"main\">Fish</a> 119).
