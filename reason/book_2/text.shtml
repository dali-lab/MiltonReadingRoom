<p class="first"> <span class="varspell" title="How"><span class="minitial">H</span>ow</span> happy
were it for this frail, and as it may be truly <span class="varspell"
title="called">call'd</span>,<span class="varspell" title="mortal"> mortall</span> life of man,
since all earthly things which have the name of good and convenient in our daily use, are withall so
cumbersome and full of trouble if knowledge yet which is the best and lightsomest possession of the
mind, were as the common saying is, no burden, and that what it wanted of being a load to any part
of the body, it did not with a <span class="varspell" title="heavy">heavie</span> advantage overlay
upon the spirit. For not to speak of that knowledge that rests in the contemplation of <span
class="varspell" title="natural">naturall</span> causes and dimensions, which must needs be a lower
wisdom, as the object is low, certain it is that he who hath <span class="varspell"
title="obtained">obtain'd</span> in more then the scantest measure to know any thing distinctly of
God, and of his true worship, and what is infallibly good and happy in the state of <span
class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> life, what in <span class="varspell" title="itself">it
selfe</span> evil and miserable, though vulgarly not so <span class="varspell"
title="esteemed">esteem'd</span>, he that hath <span class="varspell"
title="obtained">obtain'd</span> to know this, the only high valuable wisdom indeed, remembring also
that God even to a <span class="varspell" title="strictness">strictnesse</span> requires the <span
class="varspell" title="improvement">improvment</span> of these his <a href="" id="talents" class="annotBtn">entrusted gifts</a>, cannot but
sustain a sorer burden of mind, and more pressing then any supportable toil, or <span
class="varspell" title="weight">waight</span>, which the body can <span class="varspell"
title="labor">labour</span> under; how and in what manner he shall dispose and employ those <span
class="varspell" title="sums">summes</span> of knowledge and illumination, which God hath sent him
into this world <a href="" id="trade" class="annotBtn">to trade with</a>. And that which <span class="varspell"
title="aggravates">aggravats</span> the burden more, is, that having <span class="varspell"
title="received">receiv'd </span>amongst his allotted parcels certain <span class="varspell"
title="precious">pretious </span>truths of such an orient <span class="varspell"
title="luster">lustre</span> as no Diamond can <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span>,
which <span class="varspell" title="nevertheless">never the lesse</span> he has in charge to put off
at any cheap rate, yea for nothing to them that will, the great <span class="varspell"
title="Merchants">Marchants</span> of this world fearing that this <span class="varspell"
title="course">cours </span>would soon discover, and disgrace the <span class="varspell"
title="false">fals</span> glitter of their <span class="varspell"
title="deceitful">deceitfull</span> wares wherewith they abuse the people, like poor Indians with
beads and glasses, <span class="varspell" title="practice">practize</span> by all means how they may
<span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span> the venting of such rarities and such a
<span class="varspell" title="cheapness">cheapnes</span> as would <span class="varspell"
title="undo">undoe</span> them, and turn their trash upon their hands. Therefore by gratifying the
corrupt desires of men in fleshly doctrines, they <span class="varspell" title="stir">stirre</span>
them up to persecute with hatred and contempt all those that seek to bear themselves uprightly in
this their spiritual factory: which they foreseeing, though they cannot but testify of Truth and the
excellence of that heavenly <span class="varspell" title="traffic">traffick</span> which they bring
against what opposition, or danger soever, yet needs must it sit heavily upon their spirits, that
being in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> prime intention and their own, selected
heralds of peace, and dispensers of treasure inestimable without price to them that have no pence,
they <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> in the discharge of their <span
class="varspell" title="commission">commision</span> that they are made the greatest variance and
<span class="varspell" title="offense">offence</span>, a very sword and fire both in house and City
over the whole earth. This is that which the said Prophet <a href="" id="laments" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell"
title="Jeremiah">Ieremiah</span></span> laments</a>, <span class="mi"><span class="varspell"
title="Woe">Wo</span> is me my mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife, and
contention.</span> And although divine inspiration must certainly have been sweet to those ancient
<span class="varspell" title="prophets">profets</span>, yet the <span class="varspell"
title="irksomeness">irksomnesse</span> of that truth which they brought was so unpleasant to them
that <span class="varspell" title="everywhere">every where </span>they call it a <a href="" id="burden" class="annotBtn">burden</a>. Yea that <a href="" id="eatbook" class="annotBtn">mysterious book of Revelation</a> which the great Evangelist was bid to eat, as it
had been some eye-<span class="varspell" title="brightening">brightning</span> electuary of
knowledge, and foresight, though it were sweet in his mouth, and in the learning, it was bitter in
his belly; bitter in the denouncing. Nor was this hid from the wise Poet <span
class="mi">Sophocles,</span> who in <a href="" id="tiresias" class="annotBtn">that place of his Tragedy</a> where <span class="mi">Tiresias</span>
is <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> to resolve <span class="varspell" title="King">K.</span> <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Oedipus">Edipus</span></span>
in a matter which he knew would be grievous, brings him in bemoaning his lot, that he knew more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
other men. For surely to every good and peaceable man it must in nature needs be a <span
class="varspell" title="hateful">hatefull</span> thing to be the displeaser, and molester of
thousands; much better would it like him doubtlesse to be the messenger of <span class="varspell"
title="gladness">gladnes</span> and contentment, which is his chief intended busines, to all
mankind, but that they resist and oppose their own true <span class="varspell"
title="happiness">happinesse</span>. But <a href="" id="commands" class="annotBtn">when God commands</a> to take the trumpet and blow a dolorous
or a jarring blast, it lies not in <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> will what he
shall say, or what he shall conceal. If he shall think <a href="" id="silent" class="annotBtn">to be silent</a>, as <span class="mi"><span
class="varspell" title="Jeremiah">Ieremiah</span></span> did, because of the reproach and derision
he met with daily, and <span class="mi">all his familiar friends <span class="varspell"
title="watched">watcht </span>for his halting</span> to be <span class="varspell"
title="revenged">reveng'd</span> on him, for speaking the truth, he would be <span class="varspell"
title="forced">forc't</span> to <span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span> as he <span
class="varspell" title="confessed">confest</span>, <span class="mi">his word was in my heart as a
burning fire shut up in my bones, I was weary with forbearing, and could not stay.</span> Which might
teach these times not suddenly to condemn all things that are sharply spoken, or vehemently written,
as proceeding <a href="" id="stomach" class="annotBtn">out of stomach</a>, virulence and ill nature, but to consider rather that if the <span
class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> have <span class="varspell"
title="leave">leav</span> to say the worst that can be said, and <span class="varspell"
title="do">doe</span> the worst that can be <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, while
they strive to keep to themselves to their great pleasure and commodity those things which they
ought to render up, no man can be justly offended with him that shall <span class="varspell"
title="endeavor">endeavour</span> to impart and bestow without any gain to <span class="varspell"
title="himself">himselfe</span> those sharp, but saving words which would be a terror, and a torment
in him to keep back. For me I have <span class="varspell" title="determined">determin'd</span> to
lay up as the best treasure, and solace of a good old age, if God <span class="varspell"
title="vouchsafe">voutsafe</span> it me, the honest liberty of free speech from my youth, where I
shall think it available in so dear a concernment as the <span class="varspell"
title="Church's">Churches</span> good. For if I be either by disposition, or what other cause too
inquisitive, or <span class="varspell" title="suspicious">suspitious</span> of <span
class="varspell" title="myself">my self</span> and mine own doings, who can help it? but this I
foresee, that should the Church be brought under heavy oppression, and God have given me ability the
while to reason against that man that should be the author of so foul a deed, or should she by
blessing from above on the industry and courage of <span class="varspell"
title="faithful">faithfull</span> men change this her distracted estate into better <span
class="varspell" title="days">daies</span> without the <span class="varspell"
title="least">lest</span> furtherance or contribution of those few talents which God at that present
had lent me, I foresee what stories I should <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> within
<span class="varspell" title="myself">my selfe</span>, all my life after, of discourage and
reproach. Timorous and <span class="varspell" title="ungrateful">ingratefull</span>, the Church of
God is now again at the foot of her insulting enemies: and thou <span class="varspell"
title="bewailest">bewails't</span>, what matters it for thee or thy bewailing? when time was, thou
couldst not find a syllable of all that thou hadst read, or studied, to utter in her <span
class="varspell" title="behalf">behalfe</span>. Yet ease and <span class="varspell"
title="leisure">leasure</span> was given thee for thy retired thoughts out of the sweat of other
men. Thou hadst the diligence, the parts, the language of a man, if a vain subject were to be <span
class="varspell" title="adorned">adorn'd</span> or <span class="varspell"
title="beautified">beautifi'd</span>, but when the cause of God and his Church was to be pleaded,
for which purpose that tongue was given thee which thou hast, God <span class="varspell"
title="listened">listen'd</span> if he could <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> thy
voice among his zealous servants, but thou wert <span class="varspell" title="dumb">domb</span> as a
beast; from hence forward be that which thine own brutish silence hath made thee. Or else I should
have heard on the other <span class="varspell" title="ear">eare</span>, <span class="varspell"
title="slothful">slothfull</span>, and ever to be set light by, the Church hath now <span
class="varspell" title="overcome">overcom</span> her late distresses after the unwearied <span
class="varspell" title="labors">labours</span> of many her true servants that stood up in her <span
class="varspell" title="defense">defence</span>; thou also wouldst take upon thee to share amongst
them of their joy: but wherefore thou? where canst thou <span class="varspell"
title="show">shew</span> any word or deed of thine which might have <span class="varspell"
title="hastened">hasten'd</span> her peace; <span class="varspell" title="whatever">what ever</span>
thou dost now <span class="varspell" title="talk">talke</span>, or write, or look is the <span
class="varspell" title="alms">almes</span> of other <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span>
active prudence and <span class="varspell" title="zeal">zeale</span>. Dare not now to say, or <span
class="varspell" title="do">doe </span><span class="varspell" title="anything">any thing</span>
better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> thy former sloth and infancy, or if thou <span class="varspell"
title="darest">darst</span>, thou dost impudently to make a thrifty purchase of <span
class="varspell" title="boldness">boldnesse</span> to <span class="varspell" title="thyself">thy
selfe</span> out of the <span class="varspell" title="painful">painfull</span> merits of other men:
what before was thy sin, is now thy duty to be, abject, and <span class="varspell"
title="worthless">worthlesse</span>. These and such like lessons as these, I know would have been my
Matins duly, and my Even-song. But now by this <span class="varspell" title="little">litle</span> diligence, mark what a privilege I have <span
class="varspell" title="gained">gain'd</span>; with good men and Saints to <span class="varspell"
title="claim">clame</span> my right of lamenting the tribulations of the Church, if she should
suffer, when others that have <span class="varspell" title="ventured">ventur'd</span> nothing for
her sake, have not the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> to be admitted mourners.
But if she lift up her drooping head and prosper, among those that have something more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span
class="varspell" title="wished">wisht</span> her welfare, I have my charter and freehold of <span
class="varspell" title="rejoicing">rejoycing</span> to me and my <span class="varspell"
title="heiress">heires</span>.   Concerning therefore this wayward subject against prelaty, the
touching whereof is so <span class="varspell" title="distasteful">distastfull</span> and disquietous
to a number of men, as by what hath been said I may deserve of charitable readers to be credited,
that neither envy nor gall hath <span class="varspell" title="entered">enterd</span> me upon this
controversy, but the enforcement of conscience only, and a preventive fear <span class="varspell"
title="lest">least</span> the omitting of this duty should be against me when I would store up to
<span class="varspell" title="myself">my self</span> the good provision of peaceful hours, So lest
it should be still imputed to me, as I have found it hath <span class="varspell"
title="been">bin</span>, that some self-pleasing humor of vain-glory hath incited me to contest with
<a href="" id="famousmen" class="annotBtn">men of high estimation</a>, now while <a href="" id="greenyears" class="annotBtn">green <span class="varspell" title="years">yeers</span></a> are upon
my head, from this <span class="varspell" title="needless">needlesse</span> surmisall I shall hope
to <span class="varspell" title="dissuade">disswade</span> the intelligent and <a href="" id="equal" class="annotBtn">equal</a> auditor, if I
can but say <span class="varspell" title="successfully">succesfully</span> that which in this
exigent <span class="varspell" title="behooves">behoovs</span> me, although I would be heard only,
if it might be, by the <a name="elegantreader">elegant</a> &amp; learned reader, to whom
principally for a while I <span class="varspell" title="shall">shal</span> beg <span
class="varspell" title="leave">leav</span> I may <span class="varspell"
title="address">addresse</span> <span class="varspell" title="myself">my selfe</span>. To him it
will be no new thing though I tell him that if I hunted after praise by the ostentation of wit and
learning, I should not write thus out of mine own season, when I have neither yet <span
class="varspell" title="completed">compleated</span> to my <span class="varspell"
title="mind">minde</span> the full circle of <a href="" id="studies" class="annotBtn">my private studies</a>, although I complain not of any
insufficiency to the matter in hand, or were I ready to my wishes, it were a folly to commit any
thing elaborately <span class="varspell" title="composed">compos'd </span>to the <span
class="varspell" title="careless">carelesse</span> and interrupted listening of these tumultuous
times. Next if I were wise only to mine own ends, I would certainly take such a subject as of <span
class="varspell" title="itself">it self</span> might catch applause, whereas this hath all the
disadvantages on the contrary, and such a subject as the publishing whereof might be <span
class="varspell" title="delayed">delayd</span> at pleasure, and time enough to <span
class="varspell" title="pencil">pencill</span> it over with all the curious touches of art, even to
the perfection of a <span class="varspell" title="faultless">faultlesse</span> picture, whenas in
this argument the not deferring is of great moment to the good speeding, that if solidity have
leisure to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> her office, art cannot have much. Lastly, I
should not <span class="varspell" title="choose">chuse</span> this manner of writing <span
class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> knowing <span class="varspell" title="myself">my
self</span> inferior to <span class="varspell" title="myself">my self</span>, led by the genial
power of nature to another task, I have the use, as I may account it, but of my left hand. And
though I shall be foolish in saying more to this purpose, yet since it will be such a folly as
wisest men going about to commit, have only <span class="varspell" title="confessed">confest</span>
and so committed, I may trust with more reason, because with more folly to have courteous pardon.
For although a Poet soaring in the high region of his fancies with his garland and singing robes
about him might without apology speak more of himself <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> I mean to do, yet for me sitting here
below in the cool element of prose, a <span class="varspell" title="mortal">mortall</span> thing
among many readers of no <span class="varspell" title="Imperial">Empyreall</span> conceit, to
venture and divulge unusual things of <span class="varspell" title="myself">my selfe</span>, I shall
petition to the gentler sort, it may not be envy to me. I must say therefore that after I had from
my first <span class="varspell" title="years">yeeres</span> by the <span class="varspell"
title="ceaseless">ceaselesse</span> diligence and care of my father, whom God <span class="varspell"
title="recompense">recompence</span>, <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span
class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> to the tongues, and some sciences, as my age
would suffer, by <a href="" id="teachers" class="annotBtn">sundry masters and teachers</a> both at home and at the schools, it was found that
whether ought was <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> me by them that had the
overlooking, or <span class="varspell" title="betaken">betak'n</span> to of mine own <span
class="varspell" title="choice">choise</span> in English, or other tongue, prosing or versing, but
chiefly this latter, the <span class="varspell" title="style">stile</span> by certain vital <span
class="varspell" title="signs">signes</span> it had, was likely to live. But much <span
class="varspell" title="later">latelier</span> in the <span class="varspell"
title="private">privat</span> Academies of <span class="mi">Italy,</span> whither I was <span
class="varspell" title="favored">favor'd</span> to resort, perceiving that some trifles which I had
in memory, <span class="varspell" title="composed">compos'd</span> at under twenty or thereabout
(for the manner is that <span class="varspell" title="everyone">every one</span> must give some
proof of his wit and reading there) met with acceptance above what was <span class="varspell"
title="looked">lookt</span> for, and other things which I had shifted in scarcity of books and
conveniences to patch up amongst them, were <span class="varspell" title="received">receiv'd</span>
with <a href="" id="encomiums" class="annotBtn">written Encomiums</a>, which the Italian is not forward to bestow on men of this side the <span
class="mi">Alps,</span> I began this <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> to assent both
to them and divers of my friends here at home, and not <span class="varspell"
title="less">lesse</span> to an inward prompting which now grew daily upon me, that by <span
class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this
life) <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> with the strong propensity of nature, I
might perhaps leave something so written to aftertimes, as they should not willingly let it die.
These thoughts at once <span class="varspell" title="possessed">possest</span> me, and these other.
That if <span class="mi">I</span> were certain to write as men buy Leases, <a href="" id="three" class="annotBtn">for three lives</a> and
downward, there ought no regard be sooner had, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to <span class="varspell"
title="God's">Gods</span> glory by the <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> and
instruction of my country. For which cause, and not only for that I knew it would be hard to arrive
at the second rank among the <span class="varspell" title="Latins">Latines</span>, <span
class="mi">I</span> <span class="varspell" title="applied">apply'd</span> <span class="varspell"
title="myself">my selfe</span> to <a href="" id="resolution" class="annotBtn">that resolution</a> which <span class="mi">Ariosto</span> <span
class="varspell" title="followed">follow'd</span> against the <span class="varspell"
title="persuasions">perswasions</span> of<span class="mi"> Bembo,</span> to fix all the industry and
art I could unite to the adorning of my native tongue; not to make verbal curiosities the end, that
were a <span class="varspell" title="toilsome">toylsom</span> vanity, but to be an interpreter
&amp; relater of the best and sagest things among mine own Citizens throughout this <span
class="varspell" title="Island">Iland</span> in the mother dialect. <a id="choycest"
name="choycest">That</a> what the greatest and <span class="varspell"
title="choiciest">choycest</span> wits of <span class="mi">Athens, Rome,</span> or modern <span
class="mi">Italy,</span> and those Hebrews of old did for their country, I in my proportion with
this over and above of being a Christian, might <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> for
mine: not caring to be once <span class="varspell" title="named">nam'd</span> abroad, though perhaps
I could <span class="varspell" title="attain">attaine</span> to that, but content with these British
<span class="varspell" title="Islands">Ilands</span> as my world, whose fortune hath hitherto <span
class="varspell" title="been">bin</span>, that if the Athenians, as some say, made their small deeds
great and renowned by their eloquent writers, <span class="mi">England</span> hath had her noble
<span class="varspell" title="achievements">atchievments</span> made small by the <span

hardest attempting, whether that <span class="varspell" title="Epic">Epick</span> form whereof the

when all men offer their aid to help ease and lighten the difficult labours of the Church, to whose
service by the intentions of my parents and friends <span class="mi">I</span> was <a href="" id="destined" class="annotBtn"><span

remain that <span class="mi">I</span> should single out some other reason which might undertake for

finding none of like validity with these that have already sped according to their fortune, <span
class="mi">I</span> shall <span class="varspell" title="add">adde</span> one reason why it is not to
be thought a Church-government at all, but a Church-tyranny, and is at hostile terms with the end
and reason of <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> <span class="varspell"
title="Evangelic">Evangelick</span> <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span>. 
Albeit <span class="mi">I</span> Must <span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span> to be
half in doubt whether <span class="mi">I</span> should bring it forth or no, it being so contrary to
the eye of the world, and the world so potent in most <span class="varspell"
title="men's">mens</span> hearts, that <span class="mi">I</span> shall endanger either not to be
regarded, or not to be understood. For who is <span class="varspell" title="there">ther</span>
almost that measures <a href="" id="simplicity" class="annotBtn">wisdom by simplicity</a>, strength by suffering, dignity by <span class="varspell"
title="lowliness">lowlinesse</span>, who is there that counts it <a href="" id="first" class="annotBtn">first to be last</a>, <span
class="varspell" title="something">somthing</span> to be nothing, and reckons himself of great
command in <a href="" id="servant" class="annotBtn">that he is a servant</a>? yet God when he meant to subdue the world and hell at once, part of
that to salvation, and this <span class="varspell" title="wholly">wholy</span> to perdition, made
<span class="varspell" title="choice">chois</span> of no other weapons, or auxiliaries <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> these
whether to save, or to destroy.  It had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> a small <span
class="varspell" title="mastery">maistery</span> for him, to have drawn out his Legions into array
and <span class="varspell" title="flanked">flankt</span> them with his thunder; therefore he sent
<span class="varspell" title="foolishness">Foolishnes</span> to confute Wisdom, <span
class="varspell" title="Weakness">Weaknes</span> to bind Strength, <span class="varspell"
title="Despisedness">Despisednes</span> to vanquish Pride.  And this is the great <span
class="varspell" title="mystery">mistery</span> of the Gospel made good in Christ himself, who as he
testifies came not to be <span class="varspell" title="ministered">minister'd</span> to but to
minister; and must be <span class="varspell" title="fulfilled">fulfil'd</span> in all his ministers
till his second <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span>. To <span class="varspell"
title="go">goe</span> against these principles S. <span class="mi">Paul</span> so <span
class="varspell" title="feared">fear'd</span>, that if he should but affect the wisdom of words in
his preaching, he thought it would be laid to his charge, that he had made the <span
class="varspell" title="cross">crosse</span> of Christ to be <a href="" id="effect" class="annotBtn">of none effect</a>.

Whether then Prelaty do not make of none effect the <span class="varspell"
title="cross">crosse</span> of Christ by the principles it <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> so contrary to these, nullifying the power and end of the Gospel, it shall
not want due proof, if it want not due belief. Neither <span class="varspell"
title="shall">shal</span> <span class="mi">I</span> stand to trifle with one that will tell me of
quiddities and formalities, whether Prelaty or Prelateity in abstract notion be this or that, it
suffices me that <span class="mi">I</span> find it in his skin, so I find it inseparable, or not
<span class="varspell" title="oftener">oftner</span> otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a <span class="varspell"

title="faultiness">faultines</span> was but superficial to Prelaty at the beginning, is now by the
just judgment of God long since branded and inworn into the very essence <span class="varspell"
title="thereof">therof</span>.  First therefore, if to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span>
the work of the Gospel Christ our Lord took upon him the <a href="" id="form" class="annotBtn">form of a servant</a>, how can his servant in
this <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span> take upon him the form of a Lord?
<span class="mi">I</span> know <a href="" id="bilson" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Bilson</span></a> <span class="varspell"

could have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, but this must not so complement us out of
our right minds, as to be to learn that the form of a servant was a mean, laborious and vulgar life
aptest to teach; which form Christ thought fittest, that he might bring about his will according to
his own principles choosing the meaner things of this world that he might <a href="" id="high" class="annotBtn">put under the high</a>. Now
whether the pompous garb, the Lordly life, the wealth, the haughty distance of Prelaty be those
meaner things of the world, <span class="varspell" title="whereby">wherby</span> God in them would
manage the mystery of his Gospel, be it the <span class="varspell" title="verdict">verdit</span> of
common sense. For <a href="" id="lord" class="annotBtn">Christ <span class="varspell" title="said">saith</span> in S. <span

title="mystery">mistery</span> of the Gospel, is the pure simplicity of doctrine, accounted the
<span class="varspell" title="foolishness">foolishnes</span> of this world, yet crossing and
confounding the pride and wisdom of the flesh.  And wherein consists this fleshly wisdom and pride?
in being altogether ignorant of God and his worship? no surely, for men are naturally <span
class="varspell" title="ashamed">asham'd</span> of that. Where then? it consists in a bold
presumption of ordering the worship and service of God after <span class="varspell"
title="man's">mans</span> own will in <a href="" id="ceremonies" class="annotBtn">traditions and ceremonies</a>. Now if the pride and wisdom of the
flesh were to be defeated and confounded, no doubt, but in that very point <span class="varspell"
title="wherein">wherin</span> it was proudest and thought <span class="varspell" title="itself">it
self</span> wisest, that so the victory of the Gospel might be the more illustrious. But our <span
class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> instead of expressing the <span class="varspell"
title="spiritual">spirituall</span> power of their <span class="varspell"
title="ministry">ministery</span> by warring against this chief bulwark and strong hold of the
flesh, have <span class="varspell" title="entered">enter'd</span> into fast league with the <span

class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> the strength of fleshly pride and wisdom against the
pure <a href="" id="simplicity2" class="annotBtn">simplicity of saving truth</a>. First, mistrusting to find the <span class="varspell"
title="authority">autority</span> of their order in the <span class="varspell"
title="immediate">immediat</span> institution of Christ, or his Apostles by the <span
class="varspell" title="clear">cleer</span> evidence of Scripture, they fly to the carnal
supportment of tradition: when we appeal to the Bible, they to the <span class="varspell"
title="unwieldy">unweildy</span> volumes of tradition. And <span class="varspell"
title="do">doe</span> not shame to reject the ordinance of him that is eternal for the <span
class="varspell" title="perverse">pervers</span> iniquity of sixteen <span class="varspell"
title="hundred">hunderd</span> <span class="varspell" title="years">yeers</span>; choosing rather to

title="enough">anough</span>, instead of <span class="varspell" title="showing">shewing</span> the

pre-eminence from humane consent and <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>. But

Now for their demeanor within the Church, how have they <span class="varspell"

ignominy upon the perfection of <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> <span

poor remedy of our shame? Believe it, wondrous Doctors, all <a href="" id="inward" class="annotBtn">corporeal resemblances of inward <span

Do not, <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> <a href="" id="mask" class="annotBtn">Church-maskers</a>, while Christ is <a href="" id="bareness" class="annotBtn"><span

not, as <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> do, cover and hide his righteous verity with
the polluted <span class="varspell" title="clothing">cloathing</span> of your ceremonies to make it
seem more decent in your own eyes. <span class="mi">How <span class="varspell"

title="beautiful">beautifull</span>, and is the very bringing of these tidings so decent of <span

class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> think so, because <span class="varspell"
title="you">ye</span> forsake the heavenly teaching of S. <span class="mi">Paul</span> for the
hellish Sophistry of Papism. If the multitude be rude, the lips of the Preacher must give knowledge,
and not ceremonies. And although some Christians be new born babes comparatively to some that are
stronger, yet in respect of ceremony which is but a rudiment of the Law, the weakest Christian <span
class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> thrown off the robes of his minority, and is a perfect man
as to legal rites. What <span class="varspell" title="children's">childrens</span> food there is in
the Gospel we know to be no other <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the <span class="mi"><a href="" id="theword" class="annotBtn">sincerity of the word</a> that they may grow
thereby.</span> But is <span class="varspell" title="here">heer</span> the utmost of your outbraving
the service of God? No. <span class="varspell" title="You">Ye</span> have <span class="varspell"
title="been">bin</span> bold, not to set your threshold by his threshold, or your <a href="" id="posts" class="annotBtn">posts by his

will, by his Sacrament, baptizing the Christian infant with a <span class="varspell"
title="solemn">solemne</span> sprinkle, and unbaptizing for your own part with a profane and <a href="" id="finger" class="annotBtn">impious
forefinger</a>:  as if when <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> had <span class="varspell"
title="laid">layd</span> the purifying element upon his forehead, <span class="varspell"
title="you">ye</span> meant to cancel and <span class="varspell" title="cross">crosse</span> it out
again with a <span class="varspell" title="character">caracter</span> not of <span class="varspell"
title="God's">Gods</span> bidding. O but the innocence of these ceremonies! O rather the sottish
absurdity of this excuse! what could be more innocent <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the washing of a cup, a <span
class="varspell" title="glass">glasse</span>, or hands before meat, and that under the Law when so
many washings were commanded, and by long tradition, yet our <span class="varspell"
title="Savior">Saviour</span> <a href="" id="customs" class="annotBtn">detested their <span class="varspell" title="customs">customes</span></a>,
though never so seeming <span class="varspell" title="harmless">harmlesse</span>, and charges them
severely that they had <span class="varspell" title="transgressed">transgrest</span> the

title="worshipped">worshipt</span> him in vain. How much more then must these, and much grosser
ceremonies now in force delude the end of <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span>
<span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> in the flesh against the flesh, and stifle the
sincerity of our new <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> which <span
class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> bound us to forsake all <span class="varspell"
title="carnal">carnall</span> pride and wisdom especially in matters of  religion. Thus we see again
how Prelaty <span class="varspell" title="saying">sayling</span> in opposition to the main end and
power of the Gospel <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> not <span class="varspell"
title="join">joyn</span> in that <span class="varspell" title="mysterious">misterious</span> work of

title="here">heer</span> again I find my thoughts almost in suspense <span class="varspell"
title="between">betwixt</span> <span class="varspell" title="yes">yea</span> and no, and am nigh
turning mine eye which way I may best retire, and not proceed in this subject, blaming the ardency
of my mind that <span class="varspell" title="fixed">fixt</span> me too attentively to come thus
<span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span>. For Truth, I know not how, <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> this <span class="varspell" title="unhappiness">unhappinesse</span> <span
class="varspell" title="fatal">fatall</span> to her, ere she can come to the <span class="varspell"
title="trial">triall</span> and inspection of the Understanding, being to <span class="varspell"
title="pass">passe</span> through many little wards and limits of the <span class="varspell"
title="several">severall</span> Affections and Desires, she cannot shift it, but must put on such
<span class="varspell" title="colors">colours</span> and attire, as <a href="" id="handmaids" class="annotBtn">those <span class="varspell"
title="Pathetic">Pathetick</span> handmaids of the soul</a> please to lead her in to their Queen. And if
she find so much <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span> with them, they let her <span
class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> in her own <span class="varspell"
title="likeness">likenesse</span>; if not, they bring her into the presence habited and <span
class="varspell" title="colored">colour'd</span> like a notorious <span class="varspell"
title="Falsehood">Falshood</span>. And contrary when any <span class="varspell"
title="Falsehood">Falshood</span> comes that way, if they like the errand she brings, they are so
<span class="varspell" title="artful">artfull</span> to counterfeit the very shape and visage of
Truth, that the Understanding not being able to discern the <a href="" id="fucus" class="annotBtn">fucus</a> which these <span class="varspell"
title="enchantresses">inchantresses</span> with such cunning have laid upon the feature sometimes of
Truth, sometimes of <span class="varspell" title="Falsehood">Falshood</span> interchangeably,
<a href="" id="sentences" class="annotBtn">sentences</a> for the most part one for the other at the first blush, according to the span
class="varspell" title="subtle">suttle</span> imposture of these sensual mistresses that keep the
ports and passages between her and the object. So that were it not for leaving imperfect that which
is already said, I should <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> <span class="varspell"
title="near">neer</span> to relinquish that which is to follow. And because I see that most men, as
it happens in this world, either weakly, or <span class="varspell" title="falsely">falsly</span>
<span class="varspell" title="principled">principl'd</span>, what through ignorance, and what
through custom of <span class="varspell" title="license">licence</span>, both in <span
class="varspell" title="discourse">discours</span> and writing, by what <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> of late written in vulgar,
have not <span class="varspell" title="seemed">seem'd</span> to attain the decision of this point, I
shall likewise assay those wily Arbitresses who in most men have, as was heard, the sole ushering of
Truth and <span class="varspell" title="Falsehood">Falshood</span> between the sense, and the soul,
with what loyalty they will use me in <span class="varspell" title="conveying">convoying</span> this
Truth to my understanding; the rather for that by as much acquaintance as I can obtain with them, I
<span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not find them <span class="varspell"
title="engaged">engag'd</span> either one way or other. Concerning <span class="varspell"
title="therefore">therfore</span> ecclesial jurisdiction, I find still more <span class="varspell"
title="controversy">controversie</span>, who should administer it, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> diligent <span
class="varspell" title="inquiry">enquiry</span> made to learn what it is, for had the pains <span
class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> taken to search out that, it had <span class="varspell"
title="been">bin</span> long <span class="varspell" title="ago">agoe</span> <span class="varspell" title="enrolled">enroul'd</span> to be nothing
<span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> but a pure tyrannical forgery of the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>; and
that jurisdictive power in the Church there ought to be none at all. It cannot be <span class="varspell" title="conceived">conceiv'd</span> that
what men now call jurisdiction in the Church, should be other thing <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a Christian censorship; 
and therefore is it most commonly and truly ecclesiastical censure. Now if the <a href="" id="censor" class="annotBtn">Roman censor</a> a
civil function, to that severe <a href="" id="assise" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="assize">assise</span></a> of <span class="varspell" title="surveying">survaying</span> and <span class="varspell" title="controlling">controuling</span> the privatest, and sliest manners
of all men and all degrees had no jurisdiction, no courts of plea, or <span class="varspell" title="indictment">inditement</span>, no punitive force
<span class="varspell" title="annexed">annext</span>, whether it were that to this manner of correction the <span class="varspell" title="entanglement">intanglement</span> of suits was improper, or
that the notice of those upright Inquisitors extended to such the most covert and <span class="varspell" title="spirituous">spiritous</span> vices as
would slip easily between the wider and more material grasp of Law; Or that it stood more with the
Majesty of that office to have no other <span class="varspell" title="Sergeants">Serjeants</span> or maces about them but those invisible ones of
Terror and shame: Or lastly, were it their <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span>, lest the <span class="varspell" title="greatness">greatnes</span> of this <span class="varspell"
title="authority">autority</span> and <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span> <span class="varspell" title="armed">arm'd</span> with
jurisdiction might step with ease into a tyranny. In all these respects with much more reason
undoubtedly ought the censure of the Church be quite devested and <span class="varspell" title="disentailed">disintal'd</span> of all jurisdiction
whatsoever. For if the <span class="varspell" title="course">cours</span> of judicature to a
political censorship seem either too tedious, or too contentious, much more may it to the discipline
of Church whose definitive decrees are to be speedy, but the execution of <span class="varspell" title="rigor">rigour</span> slow, contrary to
what in legal proceedings is most usual, and by how much the <span class="varspell"
title="less">lesse</span> contentious it is, by so much will it be the more Christian. And if the
censor in his <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> <a href="" id="episcopy" class="annotBtn">episcopy</a> being to judge most in matters not answerable by writ or action could
not use an instrument so <span class="varspell" title="gross">grosse</span> and bodily as jurisdiction is, how can the minister of Gospel manage
the corpulent and secular trial of bill and <span class="varspell" title="process">processe</span> in things <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> spiritual. Or could that Roman
office without this juridical sword or <a href="" id="saw" class="annotBtn">saw</a> strike such a reverence of <span class="varspell"
title="itself">it self</span> into the most undaunted hearts, as with one single dash of ignominy to
put all the Senate and Knighthood of <span class="mi">Rome</span> into a tremble, surely much rather
might the heavenly <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministery</span> of the Evangel bind <span class="varspell" title="herself">her
self</span> about with <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> more <span class="varspell"
title="piercing ">pearcing</span> beams of Majesty and <span class="varspell" title="awe">aw</span> by wanting the beggarly help of <a href="" id="halings" class="annotBtn">halings
and amercements</a> in the use of her <a href="" id="keys" class="annotBtn">powerful <span class="varspell" title="Keys">Keies</span></a>. For when the Church without temporal support is
able to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> her great works upon the <span class="varspell" title="unforced">unforc't</span> obedience of
men, it argues a divinity about her. But when she thinks to credit and better her <span
class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span> efficacy, and to win <span class="varspell" title="herself">her
self</span> respect and dread
by strutting in the <span class="varspell" title="false">fals</span> <span class="varspell" title="vizard">visard</span> of worldly <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>,
tis evident that God is not there; but that her <span class="varspell" title="apostolic">apostolick</span> <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertu</span> is departed from her, and <span
class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> left her <a href="" id="cold" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Key-cold</span></a>. Which she <span
class="varspell" title="perceiving">perceaving</span> as in a <span class="varspell" title="decayed">decay'd</span> nature seeks to the outward
fomentations  and chafings of worldly help, and external flourishes, to fetch, if it be possible,
some motion into her <span class="varspell" title="extreme">extream</span> parts, or to hatch a counterfeit life with the crafty and <span class="varspell" title="artificial">arteficial</span>
heat of jurisdiction. But it is observable that so long as the Church in true imitation of Christ
can be content to <a href="" id="ass" class="annotBtn">ride upon an <span class="varspell" title="Ass">Asse</span></a> carrying <span class="varspell" title="herself">her
self</span> and her government along in a mean and simple
guise, she may be as he is, a <a href="" id="lion" class="annotBtn">Lion of the tribe of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Judah">Juda</span></span></a>, and in her humility
all men with loud <span class="varspell" title="Hosannahs">Hosanna's</span> will <span class="varspell" title="confess">confesse</span> her
<span class="varspell" title="greatness">greatnes</span>. But when despising the mighty operation of the spirit by the weak things of this world she
thinks to make <span class="varspell" title="herself">her
self</span> bigger and more considerable by using the way of civil force and
jurisdiction, as she sits upon this Lion she changes into an <span class="varspell" title="Ass">Asse</span>, and instead of <span class="varspell" title="Hosannahs">Hosanna's</span> every
man pelts her with stones and dirt. Lastly, if the wisdom of the Romans <span class="varspell"
title="feared">fear'd</span> to commit jurisdiction to an office of so high esteem and <span class="varspell" title="dread">dred</span> as was
the censors, we may see what a <a href="" id="solecism" class="annotBtn">solecism</a> in the art of policy it <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> all this while through
Christendom to give jurisdiction to ecclesiastical Censure. For that strength <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> with religion
<span class="varspell" title="abused">abus'd</span> and pretended to ambitious ends must of necessity breed the heaviest and most quelling
tyranny not only upon the necks, but even to the souls of men, which if Christian <span
class="mi">Rome</span> had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> so <a href="" id="cautelous" class="annotBtn">cautelous</a> to prevent
in her Church, as Pagan <span class="mi">Rome</span> was in her state, we had not had such a
lamentable experience thereof as now we have from thence upon all Christendom. For although I said
before that the Church coveting to ride upon the Lionly form of jurisdiction makes a transformation
of <span class="varspell" title="herself">her
self</span> into an <span class="varspell" title="Ass">Asse</span>, and becomes despicable, that is to those whom God <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="enlightened">enlight'nd</span> with true knowledge; but where they remain yet in the <span class="varspell" title="relics">reliques</span> of
superstition, this is the extremity of their bondage, and <span class="varspell" title="blindness">blindnes</span>, that while they think they <span
class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> <span class="varspell" title="obedience">obeisance</span> to the Lordly visage of a Lion, they <span
class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> it to an <span class="varspell" title="ass">asse</span>, that through the just <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> of God is
permitted to play the dragon among them because of their <span class="varspell" title="willful">wilfull</span> stupidity. And let England here
well rub her eyes, lest by leaving jurisdiction and Church censure to the same persons, now that God
<span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> so
long <span class="varspell" title="medicining">medcining</span> her eyesight, she <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not with her
<span class="varspell" title="overpolitic">overpolitick</span> fetches <span class="varspell" title="mar">marre</span> all, and bring <span class="varspell" title="herself">her
self</span> back again to worship this <span class="varspell" title="Ass">Asse</span> bestriding a
Lion. Having hitherto <span class="varspell" title="explained">explain'd</span>, that to <span class="varspell" title="ecclesiastical">ecclesiasticall</span> censure no jurisdictive power can be added
without a childish and dangerous oversight in polity, and a pernicious contradiction in <span
class="varspell" title="evangelic">evangelick</span> discipline, as anon more fully;  it will be
next to declare <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> the true reason and force of
Church censure consists, which by then it shall be laid open to the root, so little is it that I
fear lest any <span class="varspell" title="crookedness">crookednes</span>, any <span class="varspell" title="wrinkle">wrincle</span> or spot should be found in presbyterial government, that if
<a href="" id="bodin" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Bodin</span></a> the famous French writer though a papist, yet affirms that the
<span class="varspell" title="Commonwealth">Commonwelth</span> which maintains this discipline will certainly flourish in <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertu</span> and piety, I dare
assure <span class="varspell" title="myself">my self</span> that every true protestant will admire the integrity, the <span class="varspell" title="uprightness">uprightnes</span>, the divine and
gracious purposes <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span>, and even for the reason of it so coherent with the doctrine of the Gospel,
besides the evidence of command in Scripture, will <span class="varspell"
title="confess">confesse</span> it to be the only true Church-government, and that contrary to the
whole end and <span class="varspell" title="mystery">mistery</span> of <span class="varspell"
title="Christ's">Christs</span> <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> in the flesh a
false appearance of the same is <span class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> by Prelaty. But because some count it rigorous, and that
hereby men shall be liable to a double punishment, I will begin <span class="varspell" title="somewhat">somwhat</span> higher and speak of
punishment. Which, as it is an evil, I esteem to be of two sorts, or rather two degrees only, a
<span class="varspell" title="reprobate">reprobat</span> conscience in this life, and hell in the other world. Whatever else men call punishment,
or censure is not properly an evil, so it be not an <span class="varspell" title="illegal">illegall</span> violence, but a saving <span class="varspell" title="medicine">med'cin</span>
<span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordaine'd</span> of God both for the <span class="varspell" title="public">publik</span> and <span class="varspell" title="private">privat</span> good of man, who consisting of two parts the inward
and the outward, was by the <span class="varspell" title="eternal">eternall</span> providence left under two sorts of cure, the Church and the
<span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span>. The <span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span> <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> only to <span class="varspell" title="deal">deale</span> with the
outward part, I mean not of the body alone, but of the mind in all her outward acts, which in
Scripture is <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> the outward man. So that it would be <span class="varspell" title="helpful">helpfull</span> to us if we might borrow such
<span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> as the Rhetoricians by patent may give us,
with a kind of Promethean skill to shape and fashion this outward man into the similitude of a
body, and set him visible before us; imagining the inner man only as the soul. Thus then the <span class="varspell" title="civil">civill</span>
<span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span> looking only upon the outward man (I say as a <span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span>, for what he <span
class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> further, he <span class="varspell"
title="does">doth</span> it as a member of the Church) if he find in his complexion, skin, or
outward temperature the <span class="varspell" title="signs">signes</span> and marks, or in his doings the effects of injustice, rapine, lust,
cruelty, or the like, sometimes he shuts up as in <span class="varspell" title="frenetic">frenetick</span>, or infectious diseases; or confines
within <span class="varspell" title="doors">dores</span>, as in every sickly estate. Sometimes he
shaves by penalty, or <a href="" id="mulct" class="annotBtn">mulct</a>, or <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> to cool and take down those luxuriant humors which wealth and
<span class="varspell" title="excess">excesse</span> have <span class="varspell" title="caused">caus'd</span> to abound. <span class="varspell" title="Otherwise">Otherwhiles</span> he <span class="varspell" title="sears">seres</span>, he cauterizes, he scarifies, lets blood, and
finally for utmost remedy cuts off. The patients which <a href="" id="mostanend" class="annotBtn">mostanend</a> are brought into his hospital are
such as are <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> <span class="varspell" title="gone">gon</span>, and beside themselves (<span
class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span>e they be <span class="varspell" title="falsely">falsly</span> <span class="varspell" title="accused">accus'd</span>) so that force is necessary
to tame and quiet them in their unruly fits, before they can be made capable of a more <span class="varspell" title="humane">human</span> cure.
His general end is the outward peace and <span class="varspell" title="welfare">wel-fare</span> of the Commonwealth and civil <span
class="varspell" title="happiness">happines</span> in this life. His particular end in every man is,
by the infliction of pain, <span class="varspell" title="damage">dammage</span>, and disgrace, that the senses and common perceivance might carry
this message to the soul within, that it is neither <span class="varspell" title="easeful">easefull</span>, profitable, nor <span class="varspell" title="praiseworthy">praisworthy</span> in this
life to <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>. Which must needs tend to the good of
man, whether he be to live or die; and be undoubtedly the first means to a natural man, especially
an offender, which might open his eyes to a higher consideration of good and <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, as it is taught
in religion. This is seen in the often penitence of those that suffer, who, had they <span class="varspell" title="escaped">scapt</span>, had <span class="varspell" title="gone">gon</span>
on sinning to an immeasurable heap, which is one of the <span class="varspell" title="extremest">extreamest </span>punishments. And this is all that
the <a href="" id="magistrat" class="annotBtn">civil <span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span></a>, as so being, confers to the healing of <span class="varspell"
title="man's">mans</span> mind, working only by terrifying <span class="varspell" title="plasters">plaisters</span> upon the rind &amp; orifice of
the sore, and by all outward appliances, as the Logicians say, a posteriori, at the effect, and not
from the cause: not once touching the inward bed of corruption, and that <span class="varspell" title="hectic">hectick</span> disposition to
<span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span>, the <span class="varspell" title="source">sourse</span> of all vice, and obliquity against the rule of Law. Which how insufficient it is
to cure the soul of man, we cannot better <span class="varspell" title="guess">guesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by the art of bodily <span class="varspell" title="physic">phisick</span>. Therefore God to
the intent of further healing <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> <span class="varspell" title="depraved">deprav'd</span> mind, to
this power of the <span class="varspell" title="Magistrate">Magistrat</span> which contents <span class="varspell" title="itself">it self</span> with
the restraint of evil doing in the external man, added that which we call censure, to purge it and
remove it clean out of the inmost soul. In the beginning this <span class="varspell"
title="authority">autority</span> seems to have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span>
<span class="varspell" title="placed">plac't</span>, as all both civil and religious rites once were, only in each father of family. Afterwards
among the heathen, in the wise men and Philosophers of the age; but so as it was a thing voluntary,
and no set government. More distinctly among the Jews as being <span class="varspell"
title="God's">Gods</span> peculiar, where the Priests, Levites, <span class="varspell" title="Prophets">Profets</span>, and at last the Scribes and
<span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> took charge of instructing, and overseeing the lives of the people. But in the Gospel,
which is the straitest and the dearest <span class="varspell" title="covenant">cov'nant</span> can be made between God and man, <span title="we">wee</span> being now his
<a href="" id="sons" class="annotBtn">adopted sons</a>, and nothing fitter for us to think on, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to be <a href="" id="likehim" class="annotBtn">like him</a>, united to him, and <a href="" id="expresse" class="annotBtn">as he
pleases to <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> it</a>, to have fellowship with him, it is all necessity that we should expect this
<span class="varspell" title="blessed">blest</span> efficacy of healing our inward man to be <span class="varspell"
title="ministered">minister'd</span> to us in a more familiar and effectual method <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ever before.
God being now no more a judge after the sentence of the Law, nor as it were a <span class="varspell" title="schoolmaster">schoolmaister</span> of
perishable rites, but a most indulgent father governing his Church as a family of sons in their
discreet age; and <span class="varspell" title="therefore">therfore</span> in the sweetest and
mildest manner of paternal discipline he <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> committed
this other office of preserving in healthful constitution the innerman, which may be <span class="varspell" title="termed">term'd</span> the
spirit of the soul, to his spiritual deputy the minister of each Congregation; who being best
acquainted with his own flock, <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> best reason to know
all the secretest diseases likely to be there. And look by how much the internal man is more
excellent and noble <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the external, by so much is his cure more exactly, more <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span>, and more
particularly to be <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</span>. For which cause the holy Ghost by the Apostles <span class="varspell" title="joined">joyn'd</span> to the minister,
as assistant in this great office sometimes a certain number of <a href="" id="brethren" class="annotBtn">grave and faithful brethren</a>, (for
neither <span class="varspell" title="does">doth</span> the <span class="varspell" title="physician">phisitian</span> <span class="varspell"
title="do">doe</span> all in restoring his patient, he prescribes, another prepares the <span class="varspell" title="medicine">med'cin</span>,
some tend, some watch, some visit) much more may a minister partly not see all, partly <span class="varspell" title="err">erre</span> as a
man: besides that nothing can be more for the <span class="varspell" title="mutual">mutuall</span> <span class="varspell"
title="honor">honour</span> and love of the people to their <a href="" id="pastor" class="annotBtn">Pastor</a>, and his to them, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> when in
select numbers and courses they are seen partaking, and doing reverence to the holy duties of
discipline by their serviceable, and solemn presence, and receiving <span class="varspell"
title="honor">honour</span> again from their <span class="varspell" title="employment">imployment</span>, not now any more to be separated in the
Church by <span class="varspell" title="veils">vails</span> and partitions as <span class="varspell" title="laics">laicks</span> and unclean, but admitted to wait upon the <a href="" id="tabernacle" class="annotBtn">tabernacle</a> as
the <span class="varspell" title="rightful">rightfull</span> Clergy of Christ, a chosen generation, a <a href="" id="royal" class="annotBtn">royal Priesthood</a> to offer up spiritual
sacrifice in that meet place to which God and the Congregation shall call and <span class="varspell" title="assign">assigne</span> them. And
this all Christians ought to know, that the <a href="" id="title" class="annotBtn">title of Clergy</a> S. <span class="mi">Peter</span> gave to
all <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> people, till <a href="" id="higinus" class="annotBtn">Pope <span
class="mi">Higinus</span></a> and the succeeding Prelates took it from them, appropriating that name to
themselves and their Priests only; and condemning the rest of <span class="varspell"
title="God's">Gods</span> inheritance to an injurious and <span class="varspell" title="alienated">alienat</span> condition of Laity, they separated
from them by local partitions in Churches, through their <span class="varspell" title="gross">grosse</span> ignorance and pride imitating the
<a href="" id="temple" class="annotBtn">old temple</a>: and excluded the members of Christ from the property of being members, the bearing of
orderly and fit offices in the ecclesiastical body, as if they had meant to sow up that Jewish <span class="varspell" title="veil">vail</span>
which Christ by his death on the <span class="varspell" title="Cross">Crosse</span> <a href="" id="sunder" class="annotBtn">rent in sunder</a>. Although these usurpers could not so
presently <span class="varspell" title="overmaster">over-maister</span> the liberties and <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> titles
of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> freeborn Church, but that <a href="" id="origen" class="annotBtn"><span
class="mi">Origen</span></a> being yet a lay man expounded the Scriptures <span class="varspell" title="publicly">publickly</span>, and was therein
defended by <a href="" id="alexander" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Alexander</span> of Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="" id="theoctistus" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Theoctistus</span>
of C&aelig;sarea</a> producing in his behalf <span class="varspell" title="diverse">divers</span> examples that the privilege of teaching was
anciently permitted to many worthy Laymen; And <a href="" id="cyprian" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Cyprian</span></a> in his Epistles
professes he will <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> nothing without the advice and assent
of his assistant <span class="varspell" title="laics">Laicks</span>. Neither did the <a href="" id="councel" class="annotBtn">first Nicene <span class="varspell" title="council">councel</span></a>, as great and learned as it was, think
it any robbery to receive in, and require the help and presence of many learned lay brethren, as
they were then <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span>. Many other <span class="varspell" title="authorities">autorities</span> to confirm this assertion both out of Scripture and the
writings of next antiquity <a href="" id="golartius" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Golartius</span></a> <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> collected in his notes upon <span class="mi">Cyprian;</span> whereby it will
be evident that the Laity not only by <span class="varspell" title="Apostolic">Apostolick</span>
permission, but by consent of many the ancientest
Prelates did <span class="varspell" title="participate">participat</span> in Church offices as much as is <span class="varspell" title="desired">desir'd</span> any lay Elder should now do.
Sometimes also not the Elders alone, but the whole body of the Church is interested in the work of
discipline, as oft as <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> satisfaction is given by those that have given <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> scandal. Not
to speak now of her right in elections. But another reason there is in it, which though religion did
not commend to us, yet <span class="varspell" title="moral">morall</span> and civil prudence could not but extol. It was thought of old in
Philosophy, that shame or to call it better, the reverence of our elders, our brethren, and friends
was the greatest incitement to <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> deeds and the greatest dissuasion from unworthy attempts
that might be. Hence we may read in the Iliad where <span class="mi">Hector</span> being <span class="varspell" title="wished">wisht</span> to
retire from the <span class="varspell" title="battle">battel</span>, many of his forces being routed, makes answer that he durst not <a href="" id="shame" class="annotBtn">for shame</a>,
lest the Trojan Knights and Dames should think he did ignobly. And certain it is that <span class="varspell" title="whereas">wheras</span> Terror
is thought such a great stickler in a Commonwealth, <span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> shame is a <span class="varspell"
title="far">farre</span> greater, and has more reason. For where shame is there is fear, but where
fear is there is <a href="" id="fear" class="annotBtn">not presently shame</a>. And if any thing may be done to inbreed in us this generous
and Christianly reverence one of another, the very <span class="varspell" title="Nurse">Nurs</span> and Guardian of piety and <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>, it can not
sooner be <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by such a discipline in the Church, as may use us to have in <span class="varspell" title="awe">aw</span> the assemblies of the
faithful, &amp; to count it a thing most grievous, next to the grieving of <span class="varspell"
title="God's">Gods</span> Spirit, to offend those whom he <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> put in <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>, as a
healing superintendence over our lives and <span class="varspell" title="behaviors">behaviours</span>, both to our own <span class="varspell"
title="happiness">happines</span> and that we may not give <span class="varspell" title="offense">offence</span> to good men, who without amends
by us made, dare not against <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> command hold communion
with us in holy things. And this will be accompanied with a religious <span class="varspell" title="dread">dred</span> of being outcast from the
company of Saints, and from the fatherly protection of God in his Church, to consort with the devil
and his angels. <a name="selfesteem">But</a> there is yet a more ingenuous and noble degree of
honest shame, or call it if you will <a href="" id="esteem" class="annotBtn">an esteem</a>, whereby men bear an inward reverence toward their
own persons. And if the love of God as a <a href="" id="fire" class="annotBtn">fire sent from heaven</a> to be ever kept alive upon the altar
of our hearts, be the first principle of all godly and <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span> actions in men, this pious and just
<span class="varspell" title="honoring">honouring</span> of <span class="varspell" title="ourselves">our selves</span> is the second, and may be thought as the <a href="" id="radical" class="annotBtn">radical moisture</a> and fountain
head, whence every laudable and worthy <span class="varspell" title="enterprise">enterprize</span> issues forth. And although I have <span class="varspell" title="given">giv'n</span> it the
name of a liquid thing, yet is it not incontinent to bound <span class="varspell" title="itself">it
self</span>, as humid things are, but <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> in it a most
restraining and <span class="varspell" title="powerful">powerfull</span> abstinence to start back, and glob <span class="varspell" title="itself">it self</span> upward from the mixture of
any ungenerous and unbeseeming motion, or any <span class="varspell" title="soil">soile</span> wherewith it may peril to stain <span
class="varspell" title="itself">it self</span>. Something I <span class="varspell"
title="confess">confesse</span> it is to be <span class="varspell" title="ashamed">asham'd</span> of
evil doing in the presence of any, and to reverence the opinion and the countenance of a good man
rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a bad, fearing most in his sight to offend, goes so <span class="varspell"
title="far">farre</span> as almost to be <span class="varspell" title="virtuous">vertuous</span>; yet this is but still the <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> of infamy, and
many such, when they find themselves alone, saving their reputation will compound with other
scruples, and come to a close treaty with their dearer vices in secret. But he that holds himself in
reverence and due esteem, both for the dignity of <a href="" id="image" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span>
image upon him</a>, and for the price of his redemption, which he thinks is visibly <a href="" id="markt" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="marked">markt</span> upon his
forehead</a>, accounts <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> both a fit person to do the noblest and godliest deeds, and much better
worth <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to deject and defile, with such a debasement and such a pollution as sin is, <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> so
highly <a href="" id="ransom" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="ransomed">ransom'd</span></a> and <span class="varspell" title="ennobled">enobl'd</span> to a new friendship and <span class="varspell" title="filial">filiall</span> relation with God. Nor can he fear so
much the <span class="varspell" title="offense">offence</span> and reproach of others, as he dreads and would blush at the reflection of his own
severe and modest eye upon <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, if it should see him doing or imagining that which is <span class="varspell" title="sinful">sinfull</span>
though in the deepest secrecy. How shall a man know to do <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> this right, how to <span class="varspell" title="perform">performe</span> this
<span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> duty of estimation and respect towards his own soul and body? which way will <span class="varspell" title="lead">leade</span> him
best to this hill top of sanctity and <span class="varspell" title="goodness">goodnesse</span> above which there is no higher ascent but to the
love of God which from this self-pious regard cannot be <span class="varspell" title="asunder">assunder</span>? no better way <span class="varspell" title="doubtless">doubtlesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to
let him duly understand that as he is <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> by the high calling of God to be holy and pure, so is
he by the same appointment <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordain'd</span>, and by the <span class="varspell" title="Church's">Churches</span> call admitted to such offices of discipline
in the Church to which his <span class="varspell" title="own">owne</span> <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span> gifts by
the example of <span class="varspell" title="Apostolic">Apostolick</span>
institution have <span class="varspell" title="authorized">autoriz'd</span> him. For we have <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnt</span> that the <span class="varspell" title="scornful">scornfull</span>
<span class="varspell" title="term">terme</span> of <span class="varspell" title="Laic">Laick</span>, the consecrating of Temples, carpets, and <span class="varspell" title="tablecloths">tableclothes</span>, the railing in of a
repugnant and contradictive Mount <a href="" id="sinai" class="annotBtn">Sinai in the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span></a>, as if the touch of a lay Christian who is
<span class="varspell" title="nevertheless">never the lesse</span> <span class="varspell"
title="here">Gods</span> <a href="" id="living" class="annotBtn">living temple</a>, could profane <a href="" id="dead" class="annotBtn">dead judaisms</a>, the exclusion of <span
class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> people from the offices of holy <span class="varspell" title="discipline">discipine</span> through
the pride of a usurping Clergy, causes the rest to have an unworthy and abject opinion of themselves;
to approach to holy duties with a slavish fear, and to unholy doings with a familiar <span class="varspell" title="boldness">boldnesse</span>. For
seeing such a wide and terrible distance between religious things and themselves, and that in
respect of a <span class="varspell" title="wooden">woodden</span> table  &amp; the perimeter of holy ground about it, a flagon pot, and a <a href="" id="corporal" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="linen">linnen</span>
corporal</a>, the Priest esteems their lay-ships <span class="varspell" title="unhallowed">unhallow'd</span> and unclean, they fear religion with such a
fear as loves not, and think the purity of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> too pure for them, and that any <span class="varspell" title="uncleanliness">uncleannesse</span>
is more <span class="varspell" title="suitable">sutable</span> to their unconsecrated estate. But when every good Christian <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span> acquainted
with all those glorious privileges of <a href="" id="adoption" class="annotBtn">sanctification and adoption</a> which render him more sacred <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
any dedicated altar or element, shall be <span class="varspell" title="restored">restor'd</span> to his right in the Church, and not excluded from
such place of <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span> government as his Christian
abilities and his approved good life in the eye and testimony of the Church shall <span
class="varspell" title="prefer">preferre</span> him to, this and nothing sooner will open his eyes
to a wise and true valuation of <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, which is so requisite and high a point of Christianity,
and will <span class="varspell" title="stir">stirre</span> him up to walk worthy the <span class="varspell" title="honorable">honourable</span> and
grave <span class="varspell" title="employment">imployment</span> wherewith God and the Church <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span>
<span class="varspell" title="dignified">dignifi'd</span> him: not fearing lest he should meet with some outward holy thing in religion which his
lay touch or presence might profane, but lest something unholy from within his own heart should
<span class="varspell" title="dishonor">dishonour</span> and profane in <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span> that Priestly unction and Clergy-right whereto Christ <span
class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="entitled">entitl'd</span> him. Then would the congregation of the Lord <span class="varspell" title="soon">soone</span>
recover the true <span class="varspell" title="likeness">likenesse</span> and visage of what she is
indeed, a holy generation, a <a href="" id="royall" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="royal">royall</span> Priesthood</a>, a Saintly communion, the <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span> and City of God.
And this I hold to be another considerable reason why the functions of Church-government ought to be
free and open to any Christian man though never so <span class="varspell" title="laic">laick</span>, if his capacity, his faith, and prudent
<span class="varspell" title="demeanor">demeanour</span> commend him. And this the <a href="" id="warrant" class="annotBtn">Apostles warrant us</a> to do. But the <span class="varspell"
title="Prelates">Prelats</span> object that this will bring <span class="varspell" title="profaneness">profanenesse</span> into the Church, to whom
may be <span class="varspell" title="replied">reply'd</span>, that none have brought that in more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> their own irreligious courses; nor more
driven <span class="varspell" title="holiness">holinesse</span> out of living into <span class="varspell" title="lifeless">livelesse</span> things.
For whereas God who <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="cleansed">cleans'd</span> every beast and creeping
<span class="varspell" title="worm">worme</span>, <a href="" id="suffer" class="annotBtn">would not suffer S. <span class="mi">Peter</span></a> to call them common or unclean, the <span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span>
Bishops in their printed orders hung up in Churches have <span class="varspell" title="proclaimed">proclaim'd</span> the best of creatures, mankind,
so <span class="varspell" title="unpurified">unpurifi'd</span> and contagious, that for him to lay his hat, or his garment upon the <span class="varspell" title="Chancel">Chancell</span> table 
they have <span class="varspell" title="defined">defin'd</span> it no <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="heinous">hainous</span> in <span class="varspell" title="express">expresse</span> words
<span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to profane the Table of the Lord. And thus have they by their <a href="" id="canaan" class="annotBtn">Canaanitish</a> doctrine (for that
which was to the Jew but jewish is to the Christian no better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> Canaanitish) thus have they made
common and unclean, thus have they made profane that nature which God <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> not only <span class="varspell" title="cleansed">cleans'd</span>, but Christ also <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="assumed">assum'd</span>. And now that the equity and just reason is so perspicuous, why in
<span class="varspell" title="Ecclesiastic">Ecclesiastick</span> censure the assistance should be added of such, as whom not the vile <span class="varspell" title="odor">odour</span> of <a href="" id="fees" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="gain">gaine</span>
and fees</a> (forbid it God and blow it with a <span class="varspell" title="whirlwind">whirlewinde</span> out of our land) but charity, <span class="varspell" title="neighborhood">neighbourhood</span>,
and duty to Church-government <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="called">call'd</span> together, where
could a wiseman wish a more <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span>, gratuitous, and meek examination of any <span class="varspell" title="offense">offence</span> that he might
happen to commit against Christianity <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> here? would he <span class="varspell"
title="prefer">preferre</span> those proud <a href="" id="simoniacall" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="simoniacal">simoniacall</span></a> Courts? Thus therefore the Minister assisted
attends his heavenly and <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span>, cure. Where we
shall see him both in the course of his proceeding, and first in the excellence of his end from the
magistrate <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span> different, and not more different <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span>
excelling. His end is to recover all that is of man both soul and body to an ever lasting health:
and yet as for worldly <span class="varspell" title="happiness">happinesse</span>, which is the proper sphere wherein the magistrate cannot but
confine his motion without a hideous <span class="varspell" title="exhorbitantcy">exorbitancy</span> from law, so little aims the Minister, as his
intended scope, to procure the much prosperity of this life, that oft-times he may have cause to
wish much of it away, as a diet puffing up the soul with a slimy <span class="varspell" title="fleshiness">fleshinesse</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="weakening">weakning</span> her <span
class="varspell" title="principal">principall</span> <span class="varspell" title="organic">organick</span> parts. Two heads of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> he has to

doctrine, not at those set <span class="varspell" title="meals">meales</span> only in <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span>, but as oft as he shall know that each infirmity,
or constitution requires. Against the latter with all the branches thereof, not <span class="varspell" title="meddling">medling</span> with that
restraining and <span class="varspell" title="styptic">styptick</span> surgery which the law uses, not indeed against the malady but against the
eruptions, and outermost effects thereof. He on the contrary beginning at the prime causes and roots
of the disease sends in those two divine ingredients of most cleansing power to the soul, Admonition
&amp; Reproof, besides which two there is no drug or antidote that can reach to purge the mind, and
without which all other experiments are but vain, <span class="varspell"
title="unless">unlesse</span> by accident. And he that will not let these <span class="varspell"
title="pass">passe</span> into him, though he be the greatest King, as <a href="" id="affirms" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Plato</span>
affirms</a>, must be thought to <span class="varspell" title="remain">remaine</span> impure within, and unknowing of those things wherein his
<span class="varspell" title="pureness">purenesse</span> and his knowledge should most appear. As soon therefore as it may be <span
class="varspell" title="discerned">discern'd</span> that the Christian patient by feeding otherwhere
on meats not allowable, but of <span class="varspell" title="evil">evill</span> juice, <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span>
<span class="varspell" title="disordered">disorder'd</span> his diet, and spread an ill <span class="varspell" title="humor">humour</span> through his <span class="varspell" title="veins">vains</span> <span class="varspell" title="immediately">immediatly</span> disposing to a <span class="varspell" title="sickness">sicknesse</span>,
the minister as being much <span class="varspell" title="nearer">neerer</span> both in eye and duty, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the magistrate, speeds him betimes to
overtake that <span class="varspell" title="diffused">diffus'd</span> malignance with some gentle potion of admonishment; or if ought be
obstructed, puts in his opening and discussive confections. This not succeeding after once or twice
or <span class="varspell" title="oftener">oftner</span>, in the presence of two or three his <span class="varspell" title="faithful">faithfull</span> brethren appointed thereto he advises him
to be more <span class="varspell" title="careful">carefull</span> of his dearest health, and what it is that he so rashly <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> let down in to the divine vessel of his soul <span class="varspell"
title="God's">Gods</span> temple. If this <span class="varspell" title="obtain">obtaine</span> not, he then with the <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> of more assistants
who are <span class="varspell" title="informed">inform'd</span> of what diligence <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> been already <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span>,
with more speedy remedies <span class="varspell" title="lays">layes</span> <span class="varspell" title="nearer">neerer</span> siege to the entrenched causes of his distemper, not sparing
such fervent and well <span class="varspell" title="aimed">aim'd</span> reproofs as may best give him to see the dangerous estate wherein he is.
To this also his brethren and friends <span class="varspell" title="entreat">intreat</span>, exhort, adjure, and all these <span class="varspell" title="endeavors">endeavours</span>, as there is
hope left, are more or <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> repeated. But if, neither
the regard of <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>, nor the reverence of his Elders and friends <span class="varspell" title="prevail">prevaile</span> with him, to leave his
<span class="varspell" title="vicious">vitious</span> appetite, then as the time urges, such engines of terror God <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> given into the hand of his minister as to search the tenderest angles of the
heart: one while he shakes his <span class="varspell" title="stubbornness">stubbornnesse</span> with racking convulsions nigh <span class="varspell" title="despair">dispaire</span>, other whiles
with deadly corrosives he gripes the very roots of his faulty liver to bring him to life through the
entry of death. Hereto the whole Church beseech him, beg of him, deplore him, pray for him. After
all this <span class="varspell" title="performed">perform'd</span> with what patience and attendance is possible, and no relenting on his part,
having done the utmost of their cure, in the name of God and of the Church they dissolve their
fellowship with him, and holding forth the <span class="varspell" title="dreadful">dreadfull</span> sponge of excommunion pronounce him <span class="varspell" title="wiped">wip't</span> out
of the list of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> inheritance, and in the custody of
Satan till he repent. Which horrid sentence though it touch neither life, nor <span class="varspell" title="limb">limme</span>, nor any worldly
possession, yet has it such a penetrating force, that swifter <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any <span class="varspell" title="chemical">chimicall</span> <span class="varspell" title="sulfur">sulphur</span>, or that
lightning which harms not the skin, and rifles the <span class="varspell" title="entrails">entrals</span>, it scorches the inmost soul. Yet even
this terrible denouncement is left to the Church for no other cause but to be as a rough and
vehement cleansing <span class="varspell" title="medicine">medcin</span>, where the malady is <span class="varspell" title="obdurate">obdurat</span>; a mortifying to life, a kind of saving by
undoing. And it may be truly said, that as the <a href="" id="mercies" class="annotBtn">mercies of wicked men are cruelties</a>, so the cruelties
of the Church are mercies. For if repentance sent from heaven meet this lost wanderer, and draw him
out of that steep journey wherein he was hasting towards destruction, to come and reconcile to the
Church, if he bring with him his bill of health, and that he is now <span class="varspell" title="clear">cleare</span> of infection and of no
danger to the other sheep, then with incredible expressions of joy all his brethren receive him, and
set before him those perfumed <span class="varspell" title="banquets">bankets</span> of Christian consolation; with <span class="varspell" title="precious">pretious</span> ointments bathing and
fomenting the old and now to be forgotten stripes which terror and shame had inflicted; and thus
with heavenly solaces they <span class="varspell" title="cheer">cheere</span> up his humble remorse, till he regain his first health and
felicity. This is the approved way which the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> prescribes, these are the <span
class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span> weapons of holy
censure,</span> and <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="ministerial">ministeriall</span> warfare, not <span class="varspell"
title="carnal">carnall</span>, but <a href="" id="mighty" class="annotBtn">mighty through God</a> to the pulling <span class="varspell" title="down">downe</span> of strong holds, casting down
imaginations, and every high thing that <span class="varspell" title="exalts">exalteth</span> <span class="varspell" title="itself">it
selfe</span> against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ.</span>  What could be done more for the healing and <span class="varspell" title="reclaiming">reclaming</span> that divine
particle of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> breathing, the soul, and what could be
done <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span>? he that would hide his faults from such a
<span class="varspell" title="wholesome">wholsome</span> curing as this, and count it a two-fold punishment, as some do, is like a man that having
foul diseases about him, perishes for shame, and the fear he has of a rigorous incision to come upon
his flesh. We shall be able by this time to discern whether <span class="varspell"
title="Prelatical">Prelaticall</span> jurisdiction be contrary to the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> or no. First therefore
the government of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> being <a href="" id="economicall" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="economical">economicall</span></a> and <span class="varspell" title="paternal">paternall</span>, that is, of such a family where there
be no servants, but all sons in obedience, not in servility, as cannot be <span class="varspell" title="denied">deny'd</span> by him that lives
but within the sound of Scripture, how can the Prelates <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> to have <span class="varspell"
title="turned">turn'd</span> the fatherly orders of <span class="varspell"
title="Christ's">Christs</span> <span class="varspell" title="household">houshold</span>, the blessed <span class="varspell" title="meekness">meeknesse</span> of his lowly roof, those ever open
and inviting <span class="varspell" title="doors">dores</span> of his dwelling house which delight
to be frequented with only <span class="varspell" title="filial">filiall</span> accesses, how can they <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> to have <span class="varspell"
title="turned">turn'd</span> these <span class="varspell" title="domestic">domestick</span> privileges into the <span class="varspell" title="bar">barre</span> of a proud <span class="varspell" title="judicial">judiciall</span> court
where fees and <span class="varspell" title="clamors">clamours</span> keep shop and drive a trade, where bribery and corruption solicits, <span class="varspell" title="paltering">paltring</span>
the free and <span class="varspell" title="moneyless">monilesse</span> power of discipline with a <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span>
satisfaction by the purse. Contrition, humiliation, confession, the very sighs of a repentant spirit
are there sold by the penny. That <span class="varspell" title="undeflowered">undeflour'd</span> and unblemishable simplicity of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span>, not she
<span class="varspell" title="herself">her selfe</span>, for that could never be, but a <a href="" id="whited" class="annotBtn">false-whited</a>, a <a href="" id="lawnie" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="lawny">lawnie</span></a> resemblance of her, like that
<span class="varspell" title="airborn">aire-born</span> <a href="" id="helen" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Helena</span></a> in the fables, made by the sorcery of <span
class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>, instead of calling her Disciples from the <a href="" id="receipt" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="receipt">receit</span>
of <span class="varspell" title="custom">custome</span></a>, is now <span class="varspell" title="turned">turn'd</span> Publican <span class="varspell" title="herself">her

up her body to a mercenary <span class="varspell" title="whoredome">whordome</span> under those fornicated arches which she <span class="varspell" title="calls">cals</span> <span
class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> house, and in the sight of those her altars which she
<span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> set up to be <span class="varspell" title="adored">ador'd</span> makes <span class="varspell" title="merchandise">merchandize</span> of the bodies
and souls of men. <a href="" id="purgatory" class="annotBtn">Rejecting purgatory</a> for no other reason, as it seems, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> because her <span class="varspell" title="greediness">greedines</span>
cannot <span class="varspell" title="defer">deferre</span> but had rather use the utmost extortion of redeemed penances in this life. But
because these matters could not be thus <span class="varspell" title="carried">carri'd</span> without a <span class="varspell" title="begged">begg'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="borrowed">borrow'd</span> force from worldly
<span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span>, therefore prelaty slighting the <span class="varspell" title="deliberate">deliberat</span>
and chosen <span class="varspell" title="counsel">counsell</span> of Christ in his <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span>
government, whose glory is in the <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknesse</span> of fleshly things to tread upon the crest of the <span class="varspell" title="world's">worlds</span>
pride and violence by the power of <span class="varspell" title="spiritual">spirituall</span>
ordinances, <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> on the contrary made these her <span class="varspell" title="friends">freinds</span>
and champions which are <span class="varspell" title="Christ's">Christs</span> enemies in this his
high <span class="varspell" title="design">designe</span>, smothering and extinguishing the <span class="varspell"
title="spiritual">spirituall</span> force of his bodily <span class="varspell" title="weakness">weaknesse</span> in the discipline of his Church
with the <span class="varspell" title="boisterous">boistrous</span> and <span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> tyranny of an undue,
<span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span> and ungospellike jurisdiction. And thus Prelaty both in her fleshly supportments, in her
<span class="varspell" title="carnal">carnall</span> doctrine of <span class="varspell" title="ceremony">ceremonie</span> and tradition, in her violent
and secular power going quite counter to the prime end of <span class="varspell"
title="Christ's">Christs</span> <span class="varspell" title="coming">comming</span> in the flesh,
that is to <span class="varspell" title="reveal">revele</span> his truth, his glory and his might in a clean contrary manner <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> Prelaty seeks
to do, thwarting and defeating the great <span class="varspell" title="mystery">mistery</span> of
God, I do not conclude that Prelaty is Antichristian, for what need I? the things themselves
conclude it. Yet if such like <span class="varspell" title="practices">practises</span>, and not many worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> these of our <span class="varspell"
title="Prelates">Prelats</span>, in that great <span class="varspell">darknesse</span> of the Roman Church, have not exempted both
her and her present members from being <span class="varspell" title="judged">judg'd</span> to be Antichristian in all <span class="varspell" title="orthodoxal">orthodoxall</span> <span class="varspell" title="esteem">esteeme</span>, I
cannot think but that it is the absolute voice of truth and all her children to pronounce this
Prelaty, and these her dark deeds in the midst of this great light wherein we live, to be more
Antichristian <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> Antichrist <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>.</p>

forth on the <a href="" id="white" class="annotBtn">white Horse</a> with his bow and his crown conquering, and to conquer. If we let the <span class="varspell" title="Angel">Angell</span>
of the <span class="varspell" title="Gospel">Gospell</span> ride on his own way, he does his proper <span class="varspell" title="business">businesse</span> conquering the high thoughts and

which <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> put into his hands to subdue your spirits by a

advancement that they must do; be the Prince never so just and <span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> to his subjects; yet such are
their malicious and depraved eyes, that they so look on him, &amp; so understand him, as if he
<span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> no other gratitude, or piece of service from them <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> this. And indeed they stand so
<span class="varspell" title="opportunely">opportunly</span> for the disturbing or the destroying of a state, being a knot of creatures whose
dignities, means, and preferments have no foundation in the Gospel, as they themselves acknowledge,
but only in the <span class="varspell" title="Prince's">Princes</span> <span class="varspell" title="favor">favour</span>, &amp; to continue so
long to them, as by pleasing him they shall deserve, whence it must needs be they should bend all
their intentions, and services to no other ends but to his, that if it should happen that a tyrant
(God turn such a scourge from us to our enemies) should come to grasp the Scepter, here were his
<span class="varspell" title="spear">speare</span> men and his lances, here were his firelocks ready, he should need no other <a href="" id="pretorian" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="praetorian">pretorian</span> band</a> nor
<a href="" id="pensionry" class="annotBtn">pensionry</a> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> these, if they could once with their perfidious preachments <span class="varspell" title="awe">aw</span> the people. For
although the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> in time of popery were sometimes
friendly <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to <a href="" id="magnacharta" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="Magna Carta">magnacharta</span></a>, it was because they
stood upon their own bottom, without their main <span class="varspell" title="dependence">dependance</span> on the royal nod: but now being well
acquainted that the protestant religion, if she will reform <span class="varspell" title="herself">her
self</span> rightly by the Scriptures, must
<span class="varspell" title="undress">undresse</span> them of all their <span class="varspell" title="gilded">guilded</span> vanities, and reduce them as they were at first, to the lowly and
<span class="varspell" title="equal">equall</span> order of Presbyters, they know it concerns them <span class="varspell" title="nearly">neerly</span> to study the times more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the text,
and to lift up their eyes to the <span class="varspell" title="hills">hils</span> of the Court, <a href="" id="whence" class="annotBtn">from whence only comes their help</a>; but if their
pride grow weary of this crouching and observance, as ere long it would, and that yet their minds
<span class="varspell" title="climb">clime</span> still to a higher ascent of worldly <span class="varspell" title="honor">honour</span>, this
only refuge can remain to them, that they must of necessity contrive to bring themselves and us back
again to the <span class="varspell" title="Pope's">Popes</span> supremacy, and this we see they had by fair degrees of late been doing. These be
the two fair supporters between which the strength of Prelaty is born up, either of inducing
tyranny, or of <a href="" id="reducing" class="annotBtn">reducing popery</a>. Hence also we may judge that Prelaty is <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> <span class="varspell"
title="falsehood">falshood</span>. For the property of Truth is, where she is <span class="varspell" title="publicly">publickly</span> taught, to
unyoke &amp; set free the minds and spirits of a Nation first from the <span class="varspell" title="thralldom">thraldom</span> of sin and
superstition, after which all honest and legal freedom of civil life cannot be long absent; but
Prelaty whom the <a href="" id="custom" class="annotBtn">tyrant custom</a> begot a natural tyrant in religion, &amp; in state the agent &amp;
minister of tyranny, seems to have had this fatal <span class="varspell" title="gift">guift</span> in her nativity like another <a href="" id="midas" class="annotBtn"><span
class="mi">Midas</span></a> that whatsoever she should touch or come <span class="varspell"
title="near">neer</span> either in ecclesial or political government, it should turn, not to gold,
though she for her part could wish it, but to the <span class="varspell" title="dross">drosse</span> and scum of slavery breeding and <span class="varspell" title="settling">setling</span>
both in the bodies and the souls of all such as <span class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> not in
time with the <span class="varspell" title="sovereign">sovran</span> <a href="" id="treacle" class="annotBtn">treacle</a> of sound doctrine provide to <span class="varspell" title="fortify">fortifie</span> their hearts against her
Hierarchy. The service of God who is Truth, her Liturgy confesses to be <a href="" id="perfect" class="annotBtn">perfect freedom</a>, but her
works and her opinions declare that the service of Prelaty is perfect slavery, and by consequence
perfect <span class="varspell" title="falsehood">falshood</span>. Which makes me wonder much that
many of the Gentry, studious men, as I <span class="varspell" title="hear">heare</span> should engage themselves to write, and speak <span class="varspell" title="publicly">publickly</span>
in her <span class="varspell" title="defense">defence</span>, but that I <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> their honest and ingenuous natures <span class="varspell"
title="coming">comming</span> to the Universities to store themselves with good and solid learning,
and there unfortunately fed with nothing else, but the <a name="scragged">scragged</a> and thorny
lectures of monkish and miserable sophistry, were sent home again with such a scholastical <span class="varspell" title="burr">burre</span> in
their throats, as <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="stopped">stopt</span> and <span class="varspell" title="hindered">hinderd</span> all true and

<span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> made them admire a sort of formal outside men
prelatically addicted, whose <span class="varspell" title="unchastened">unchast'nd</span> and unwrought minds never yet initiated or <span class="varspell" title="subdued">subdu'd</span> under the
true lore of religion or moral <span class="varspell" title="virtue">vertue</span>e, which two are the best and greatest points <span class="varspell" title="of">ot</span> learning, but

title="wherein">wherin</span> they might exercise the greatest <span class="varspell" title="virtues">vertu's</span>, and the greatest deeds of
Christian <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> in mean fortunes and little
furniture of this world, which even the sage heathen writers and those old <a href="" id="curii" class="annotBtn"><span
class="mi">Fabritii,</span> and <span class="mi">Curii</span></a> well knew to be a manner of working,
<span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> which nothing could <span class="varspell" title="liken">lik'n</span> a mortal man more to God, who delights most to <span class="varspell" title="work">worke</span> from within
himself, and not by the heavy luggage of corporeal instrument, they understand it not, &amp; think
no such matter, but admire &amp; dote upon worldly riches, &amp; <span class="varspell"
title="honors">honours</span>, with an <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> &amp; <span class="varspell" title="intemperate">intemperat</span> life, to the bane of Christianity:
yea they and their Seminaries shame not to <span class="varspell" title="profess">professe</span>,
to petition and never <a href="" id="lin" class="annotBtn">lin</a> pealing our <span class="varspell" title="ears">eares</span> that <span class="varspell"
title="unless">unlesse</span> we fat them like <span class="varspell" title="boars">boores</span>, and <span class="varspell" title="cram">cramme</span> them as they list with wealth,
with Deaneries, and <a href="" id="pluralities" class="annotBtn">pluralities</a>, with Baronies and stately preferments, all learning and religion
will <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> underfoot. Which is such a <span class="varspell" title="shameless">shamelesse</span>, such a
bestial plea, and of that odious impudence in Church-men, who should be to us a pattern of
temperance and frugal <a href="" id="mediocrity" class="annotBtn">mediocrity</a>, who should teach us to <span class="varspell" title="condemn">contemn</span> this world, and the gaudy things
thereof, according to the promise which they themselves require from us <a href="" id="baptism" class="annotBtn">in <span class="varspell" title="baptism">baptisme</span></a>, that should the
Scripture stand by and be mute, there is not that sect of Philosophers among the heathen so
dissolute, no <a href="" id="epicurus" class="annotBtn">not <span class="mi">Epicurus,</span> nor <span class="mi">Aristippus</span></a> with all
his Cyrenaick rout, but would shut his school <span class="varspell" title="doors">dores</span>
against such greasy sophisters:  not any College of Mountebanks, but would think scorn to discover
in themselves with such a brazen forehead the outrageous desire of filthy lucre. Which the <span
class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> make so little conscience of, that they are ready
to fight, and if it lay in their power, to massacre all good Christians under the names of horrible
<span class="varspell" title="schismatics">schismaticks</span> for only finding fault with their temporal dignities, their unconscionable wealth and
revenues, their <span class="varspell" title="cruel">cruell</span> <span class="varspell" title="authority">autority</span> over their brethren
that <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> in the <span class="varspell" title="world">word</span>, while they snore in their luxurious <span class="varspell" title="excess">excesse</span>. Openly <span class="varspell" title="proclaiming">proclaming</span> <span class="varspell" title="themselves">themselvs</span>
now in the sight of all men to be those which for a while they sought to cover under <span class="varspell" title="sheep's">sheeps</span> <span
class="varspell" title="clothing">cloathing</span>, ravenous and <a href="" id="wolves" class="annotBtn">savage wolves</a> <span class="varspell" title="threatening">threatning</span> <span class="varspell" title="inroads">inrodes</span>
and bloody incursions upon the flock of Christ, which they took upon them to feed, but now <span class="varspell" title="claim">clame</span> to
devour as their prey. More like that huge dragon of Egypt breathing out <span class="varspell" title="waste">wast</span>, and desolation to the
land, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> he were daily <span class="varspell" title="fattened">fatn'd</span> with <span class="varspell" title="virgin's">virgins</span> blood. Him our <a href="" id="patron" class="annotBtn">old patron Saint <span
class="mi">George</span></a> by his <span class="varspell" title="matchless">matchlesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="valor">valour</span> slew, as the <span class="varspell" title="Prelate">Prelat</span> of the Garter that reads <a href="" id="collect" class="annotBtn">his
Collect</a> can tell. And if our Princes and Knights will imitate the fame of that old champion, as by
their order of Knighthood solemnly taken, they vow, <span class="varspell" title="far">farre</span>
be it that they should uphold and side with this English Dragon; but rather to <span
class="varspell" title="do">doe</span> as indeed their oath binds them, they should make it their
Knightly adventure to pursue &amp; vanquish this mighty <span class="varspell" title="sail-winged">sailewing'd</span> monster that menaces to swallow
up the Land, <span class="varspell" title="unless">unlesse</span> her <span class="varspell" title="bottomless">bottomlesse</span> gorge may be
<span class="varspell" title="satisfied">satisfi'd</span> with the blood of the <span class="varspell" title="King's">Kings</span> daughter the Church; and may, as she was wont, fill her dark
and infamous den with the bones of the Saints. Nor will <span class="varspell" title="anyone">any one</span> have reason to think this as too
incredible or too tragical to be <span class="varspell" title="spoken">spok'n</span> of Prelaty, if he consider well from what a <span class="varspell" title="mass">masse</span> of slime
and mud, the <span class="varspell" title="slothful">sloathful</span>, the covetous and ambitious hopes of Church-promotions and fat <span class="varspell" title="Bishoprics">Bishopricks</span>
she is bred up and <span id="varspell" title="nuzzled">nuzzl'd</span> in, like a great Python from her youth, to prove the general <span class="varspell" title="poison">poyson</span> both
of doctrine and good discipline in the Land. For certainly such hopes and such principles of earth
as these wherein she welters from a <span class="varspell" title="young">yong</span> one, are the <span class="varspell"
title="immediate">immediat</span> generation both of a slavish and tyrannous life to follow, and a
pestiferous contagion to the whole Kingdom, till like that <span class="varspell" title="fen born">fenborn</span> serpent she be shot to death with
the darts of the sun, the pure and powerful beams of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span>
word. And this may serve to describe to us in part, what Prelaty <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> and what, if she stand, she
is like to be toward the whole body of people in <span class="mi">England.</span> Now that it may
<span class="varspell" title="appear">appeare</span> how she is not such a kind of evil, as <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> any
good, or use in it, which many evils have, but a <span class="varspell" title="distilled">distill'd</span> quintessence, a pure <span class="varspell" title="elixir">elixar</span> of mischief,
pestilent alike to all, I <span class="varspell" title="shall">shal</span> <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> briefly, ere I
conclude, that the <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>, as they are to the
subjects a calamity, so are they the greatest underminers and betrayers of the Monarch, to whom they
seem to be most <span class="varspell" title="favorable">favourable</span>. I cannot better liken the state and person of a King <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to that <a href="" id="samson" class="annotBtn">mighty
Nazarite <span class="mi">Samson</span></a>; who being <span class="varspell" title="disciplined">disciplin'd</span> from his birth in the precepts and
the practice of Temperance and Sobriety, without the strong drink of injurious and excessive
desires, grows up to a noble strength and perfection with those his illustrious and sunny locks the
laws waving and curling about his god like shoulders. And while he keeps them about him <span class="varspell" title="undiminished">undiminisht</span>
and unshorn, he may with the jaw-bone of an <span class="varspell" title="Ass">Asse</span>, that is, with the word of his meanest officer
<span class="varspell" title="suppress">suppresse</span> and put to confusion thousands of those that rise against his just power. But laying down
his head among the strumpet flatteries of <span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>,
while he sleeps and thinks no <span class="varspell" title="harm">harme</span>, they wickedly shaving off an those bright and <span class="varspell" title="weighty">waighty</span> tresses
of his laws, and just prerogatives which were his ornament and strength, deliver him over to
indirect and violent <span class="varspell" title="councils">councels</span>, which as those <span class="varspell" title="Philistines">Philistims</span> put out the fair, and <span
class="varspell" title="far">farre</span>-sighted eyes of his natural discerning, and make him
<span class="varspell" title="grind">grinde</span> in the prison house of their sinister ends and practices upon him. Till he knowing this
prelatical <span class="varspell" title="razor">rasor</span> to have bereft him of his wonted might, nourish again his puissant <span class="varspell" title="hair">halr</span>, the golden
<span class="varspell" title="beams">beames</span> of Law and Right; and they sternly shook, thunder with ruin upon the heads of those his evil
<span class="varspell" title="counselors">counsellors</span>, but not without great affliction to <span class="varspell" title="himself">himselfe</span>. This is the sum of their loyal service to
Kings; yet these are the men that <span class="varspell" title="still">stil</span> cry the King, the
King, the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> Anointed. We grant it, and wonder how they came to light upon any thing so true; and
wonder more, if Kings be the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> Anointed, how they dare thus <span class="varspell" title="oil">oyle</span> over and <span class="varspell" title="besmear">besmeare</span> so holy an
unction with the corrupt and putrid <span class="varspell" title="ointment">oyntment</span> of their base flatteries; which while they smooth the
skin, strike inward and envenom the life blood. What fidelity Kings can expect from <span
class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span> both examples past, and our present experience of
their doings at this day, whereon is grounded all that <span class="varspell"
title="has">hath</span> <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> said, may <span class="varspell" title="suffice">sufffice</span> to inform
us. And if they be such clippers of regal power and shavers of the Laws, how they stand affected to
the law giving <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, <span class="varspell" title="yourselves">your selves</span>, worthy <span class="varspell" title="Peers">Peeres</span> and Commons, can best <span class="varspell" title="testify">testifie</span>; the current of
whose glorious and immortal actions <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> <span
class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> only <span class="varspell" title="opposed">oppos'd</span> by the obscure and pernicious <span class="varspell" title="designs">designes</span> of the
<span class="varspell" title="Prelates">Prelats</span>: until their insolence broke out to such a
bold affront, as <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span> justly <span class="varspell" title="immured">immur'd</span> their haughty looks
within strong <span class="varspell" title="walls">wals</span>. Nor have they done <span class="varspell" title="anything">any thing</span> of late with more diligence, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to hinder or
break the happy assembling of <span class="varspell" title="Parliaments">Parlaments</span>, however
<span class="varspell" title="needful">needfull</span> to <span class="varspell" title="repair">repaire</span> the <span class="varspell" title="shattered">shatter'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="disjointed">disjoynted</span> frame of the <span class="varspell" title="Commonwealth">Common-wealth</span>, or if they cannot do
this, to <span class="varspell" title="cross">crosse</span>, to <span class="varspell" title="disenable">disinable</span>, and traduce all
<span class="varspell" title="Parliamentary">Parlamentary</span> proceedings. And this, if nothing else, plainly accuses them to be no lawful members of
the house, if they thus perpetually <span class="varspell" title="mutiny">mutine</span> against their own body. And though they pretend like
<a href="" id="harlot" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Salomon's">Salomons</span></span> harlot</a>, that they have right thereto, by the same <span class="varspell" title="judgment">judgement</span> that
<span class="mi">Salomon</span> gave, it cannot belong to them, whenas it is not <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> their assent,
but their <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> continually to divide <span class="varspell"
title="Parliaments">Parlaments</span> in twain; and not only by dividing, but by all other means to
abolish and destroy the free use of them to all posterity. For the which and for all their former
misdeeds, <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> this book and many volumes more cannot contain the <span class="varspell" title="moiety">moytie</span>, I <span class="varspell"
title="shall">shal</span> move <span class="varspell" title="you">yee</span> Lords in the behalf I dare say of many thousand good Christians,
to let your justice and speedy sentence <span class="varspell" title="pass">passe</span> against
this great malefactor Prelaty. And yet in the midst of rigor I would beseech <span class="varspell"
title="you">ye</span> to think of mercy; and such a mercy, I <span class="varspell" title="fear">feare</span> I <span class="varspell"
title="shall">shal</span> overshoot with a desire to save this falling Prelaty, such a mercy (if I
may venture to say it) as may exceed that which for only <a href="" id="righteous" class="annotBtn">ten righteous persons</a> would have <span id="v" class="varspell" title="saved">sav'd</span>
<span class="mi">Sodom.</span> Not that I dare advise <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span>
to contend with God whether he or you <span class="varspell" title="shall">shal</span> be more
merciful, but in your wise esteems to <span class="varspell" title="balance">ballance</span> the <span class="varspell" title="offenses">offences</span> of those peccant <span class="varspell" title="Cities">Citties</span> with these
enormous riots of ungodly mis-rule that Prelaty <span class="varspell" title="has">hath</span>
wrought both in the Church of Christ, and in the state of this <span class="varspell" title="Kingdom">Kingdome</span>. And if <span
class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> think <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span> may with a
pious presumption strive to <span class="varspell" title="go">goe</span> beyond God in mercy, I
shall not be one now that would dissuade <span class="varspell" title="you">ye</span>. Though God
for <span class="varspell" title="less">lesse</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> ten just persons would <a href="" id="spare" class="annotBtn">not spare <span
class="mi">Sodom,</span></a> yet if you can <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> after due search but only one good thing in prelaty
either to religion, or civil <span class="varspell" title="government">goverment</span>, to King or <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span>, to Prince or people, to law, liberty,
wealth or learning, spare her, let her live, let her spread among <span class="varspell"
title="you">ye</span>, till with her shadow, all your dignities and <span class="varspell"
title="honors">honours</span>, and all the glory of the land be <span class="varspell" title="darkened">darken'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="obscured">obscurd</span>. But on the
contrary if she be found to be malignant, hostile, destructive to all these, as nothing can be
surer, then let your severe and impartial doom imitate the divine vengeance; rain down your
punishing force upon this <span class="varspell" title="godless">godlesse</span> and oppressing
government: and bring such a dead Sea of subversion upon her, that she may never in this Land rise
more to afflict the holy reformed Church, and the elect people of God. </p>
