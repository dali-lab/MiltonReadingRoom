Milton certainly performed such exercises (see his <a href=\"../../paraphrase_114/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">paraphrase on Psalm 114</a>), but many of the translations published in the <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/60223/76\" target=\"main\">1673 edition of <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span></a> appear to have been done as much for devotional as for linguistic exercise.  Certainly Milton also took pride in the breadth of metrical virtuosity displayed in these verse translations.</p><p>It is instructive to  compare Milton\'s translation with those of the <a href=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=Psalms+80\" target=\"main\">King James Version</a> and the <a href=\"http://ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Psalms/80.html\" target=\"main\">Geneva</a>.

"date":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>April, 1648.</i>  In April of 1648 the Westminster Assembly formed a committee to find a new Psalter for the Church of Scotland.  This may support the theory of W. Hunter and other critics which holds that Milton translated these nine Psalms for the committee\'s review.</span>",
"versions":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>King James and Geneva versions.</i>  Milton\'s translation should be compared with those of the <a href=\"http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=English&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=Psalms+80\" target=\"main\">King James Version</a> and the <a href=\"http://ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Psalms/80.html\" target=\"main\">Geneva</a> Bibles.</span>",
"metre":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>metre.</i>  The meter is common meter, appearing nowhere else in Milton\'s poetry except in his translations of the Psalms.  It was the standard metrical form used in prayer books and Psalters of public and community worship.  This has led the critic William Hunter to suggest that Milton\'s translation of these nine Psalms was part of a larger effort to produce a Psalter for common worship, possibly by the Church of Scotland.</span>",

"verse1":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Psalm 80; lines 1-4.</i>  Compare with the 1647 Sternhold and Hopkins version:</p><blockquote>Thou shepherd that Israel dost keep,<br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give eare and take good heed:<br />Which leadest Joseph like a sheep,<br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dost him watch and feed,</blockquote><p></span>",

"psalm80_12":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Psalm 80; lines 11-12.</i>  Milton frequently likened England to Israel, and the call for the strong saving presence of God is especially poignant in 1648 England, caught in the turbulence of the English Civil War.</span>",
"verse3":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Psalm 80; lines 13-16.</i>  Milton\'s translation is closest to the Rous Westminster revision.  Other versions use \"deliverance\" or \"saved,\" which is closer to the original Hebrew.  Milton and Westminster Rous have instead \"safe.\"  Compare to the Westminster Rous version:</p><blockquote>Turn us again, O Lord, our God,<br />and upon us vouchsafe<br />To make thy countenance to shine,<br />and so we shall be safe.</blockquote><p></span>",
