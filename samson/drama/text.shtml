cessation from <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span>, comes forth into the open Air, to a place nigh,
somewhat <span class="varspell" title="retired">retir'd</span> there to sit a while and bemoan his condition.
Where he happens at length to be visited by certain friends and equals
of his <a href="" id="tribe" class="annotBtn">tribe,</a> which make the Chorus, who seek to comfort him what they
can; then by his old Father <span class="reversem">Manoa,</span> who <span class="varspell" title="endeavors">endeavours</span> the like, and withal
tells him his purpose to procure his liberty by ransom; lastly, that
this Feast was <span class="varspell" title="proclaimed">proclaim'd</span> by the <span class="reversem"><span class="varspell" title="Philistines">Philistins</span></span> as a day of Thanksgiving
for <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> deliverance from the hands of <span class="reversem">Samson</span>, which yet more troubles
him. <span class="reversem">Manoa</span> then departs to prosecute his <span class="varspell" title="endeavor">endeavour</span> with the <span class="reversem">Philistian</span>
Lords for <span class="reversem">Samson's</span> redemption; who in the mean while is visited by
other persons; and lastly by a <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> Officer to require his coming
to the Feast before the Lords and People, to play or shew his strength
in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> presence; he at first refuses, dismissing the <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span>
Officer with absolute <span class="varspell" title="denial">denyal</span> to come; at length <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> inwardly
that this was from God, he yields to go along with him, who came now
the second time with great <span class="varspell" title="threatenings">threatnings</span> to fetch him; the Chorus yet
remaining on the place, <span class="reversem">Manoa</span> returns full of joyful hope, to
procure <span class="varspell" title="ere">e're</span> long his <span class="varspell" title="Son's">Sons</span> deliverance: in the midst of which
discourse an <span class="varspell" title="Hebrew">Ebrew</span> comes in haste confusedly at first; and afterward
more distinctly relating the <a href="" id="cata" class="annotBtn">Catastrophe,</a> what <span class="reversem">Samson</span> had done to
the <span class="reversem"><span class="varspell" title="Philistines">Philistins</span></span>, and <a href="" id="accident" class="annotBtn">by accident</a> to himself; wherewith the Tragedy

To these <a href="" id="steps" class="annotBtn">dark steps,</a> a little further on;<br />

There I am wont to sit, when any chance<br />

Relieves me from my task of servile <span class="varspell" title="toil">toyl</span>,<span class="line" id="line5"> [ 5 ]</span><br />

Retiring from the <a href="" id="popular" class="annotBtn">popular noise,</a> I seek<br />
This unfrequented place to find some ease,<br />
Ease to the body some, none to the mind<br />
From restless <a name="swarm">thoughts,</a> that <a href="" id="swarm" class="annotBtn">like a deadly swarm</a><br />

Of Hornets <span class="varspell" title="armed">arm'd</span>, no sooner found alone,<span class="line" id="line20"> [ 20 ]</span><br />
But rush upon me thronging, and present<br />
Times past, <a href="" id="whatonceiwas" class="annotBtn">what once I was,</a> and what am now.<br />
O wherefore was my birth <a href="" id="foretold" class="annotBtn">from Heaven foretold</a><br />
Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight<br />

Of both my Parents all in flames ascended<span class="line" id="line25"> [ 25 ]</span><br />
From off the Altar, where an <span class="varspell" title="Offering">Off'ring</span> <span class="varspell" title="burned">burn'd</span>,<br />
As in a <a href="" id="fierycolumncharioting" class="annotBtn">fiery column charioting</a><br />
His Godlike presence, and from some great act<br />
Or benefit <span class="varspell" title="revealed">reveal'd</span> to <span class="mi">Abraham's</span> race?<br />

Why was my breeding <span class="varspell" title="ordered">order'd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="prescribed">prescrib'd</span><span class="line" id="line30"> [ 30 ]</span><br />
As of <a href="" id="nazarite" class="annotBtn">a person separate to God,</a><br />

<span class="varspell" title="Betrayed">Betray'd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="Captived">Captiv'd</span>, and both my Eyes put out,<br />
Made of my Enemies the scorn and gaze;<br />

To grind in Brazen Fetters under task<span class="line" id="line35"> [ 35 ]</span><br />
With this <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span>-gifted strength? O glorious strength<br />
Put to the <span class="varspell" title="labor">labour</span> of a Beast, <span class="varspell" title="debased">debas't</span><br />
Lower <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <a href="" id="bondslave" class="annotBtn">bondslave!</a> Promise was that I<br />

Eyeless in <span class="mi">Gaza</span> at the Mill with slaves,<br />
Himself in bonds under <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Philistine">Philistian</span></span> yoke;<br />
Yet stay, let me not rashly call in doubt<br />
Divine Prediction; what if all foretold<br />

Had been <span class="varspell" title="fulfilled">fulfill'd</span> but through mine own default,<span class="line" id="line45"> [ 45 ]</span><br />
Whom have I to complain of but my self?<br />
Who this high gift of strength committed to me,<br />
In <a href="" id="hair" class="annotBtn">what part <span class="varspell" title="lodged">lodg'd</span>,</a> how easily bereft me,<br />
Under the <a href="" id="sealofsilence" class="annotBtn">Seal of silence</a> could not keep,<br />

But weakly to a woman must reveal it,<span class="line" id="line50"> [ 50 ]</span><br />
<span class="varspell" title="Overcome">O'recome</span> with importunity and tears.<br />
O impotence of mind, in body strong!<br />
But what is strength without a double share<br />
Of wisdom, vast, unwieldy, <span class="varspell" title="burdensome">burdensom</span>,<br />

<a href="" id="fall" class="annotBtn">Proudly secure, yet liable to fall</a><span class="line" id="line55"> [ 55 ]</span><br />
By weakest subtleties, not made to rule,<br />
But to subserve where wisdom bears command.<br />
God, when he gave me strength, to shew withal<br />
How slight the gift was, hung it in my Hair.<br />

But peace, I must not quarrel with the will<span class="line" id="line60"> [ 60 ]</span><br />
Of highest dispensation, which herein<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Happily">Happ'ly</span> had ends above my reach to know:<br />
Suffices that to me strength is my bane,<br />
And proves the <span class="varspell" title="source">sourse</span> of all my miseries;<br />

So many, and so huge, that each apart<span class="line" id="line65"> [ 65 ]</span><br />
Would ask a life to wail, but chief of all,<br />
<a href="" id="blind" class="annotBtn">O loss of sight,</a> of thee I most complain!<br />
Blind among enemies, O worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> chains,<br />
Dungeon, or <span class="varspell" title="beggary">beggery</span>, or decrepit age!<br />

<a href="" id="light" class="annotBtn">Light the prime work of God</a> to me is <a href="" id="extinct" class="annotBtn">extinct,</a><span class="line" id="line70"> [ 70 ]</span><br />
And all her various objects of delight<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Anulled">Annull'd</span>, which might in part my grief have <span class="varspell" title="eased">eas'd</span>,<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Inferior">Inferiour</span> to the vilest now become<br />
Of man or worm; the vilest here <span class="varspell" title="excell">excel</span> me,<br />

They creep, yet see, I dark in light <span class="varspell" title="exposed">expos'd</span><span class="line" id="line75"> [ 75 ]</span><br />
To <a href="" id="daily" class="annotBtn">daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong,</a><br />
Within doors, or without, <a href="" id="still" class="annotBtn">still</a> as a fool,<br />
In power of others, never in my own;<br />
Scarce half I seem to live, <a href="" id="half" class="annotBtn">dead more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> half.</a><br />

O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,<span class="line" id="line80"> [ 80 ]</span><br />
Irrecoverably dark, total Eclipse<br />
Without all hope of day!<br />
O <a href="" id="light" class="annotBtn">first created Beam,</a> and thou great Word,<br />
Let there be light, and light was over all;<br />

Why am I thus <span class="varspell" title="bereaved">bereav'd</span> thy prime decree?<span class="line" id="line85"> [ 85 ]</span><br />
The Sun to me is dark<br />
And <a href="" id="silentmoon" class="annotBtn">silent as the Moon,</a><br />
When she deserts the night<br />
Hid in her vacant <a href="" id="moons" class="annotBtn">interlunar cave</a>.<br />

Since light so necessary is to life,<span class="line" id="line90"> [ 90 ]</span><br />
And almost life itself, if it be true<br />
That light is in the Soul,<br />
<a href="" id="soul" class="annotBtn">She all in every part</a>; why was the sight<br />
To such a <a href="" id="ball" class="annotBtn">tender ball</a> as <span class="varspell" title="the">th'</span> eye <span class="varspell" title="confined">confin'd</span>?<br />

So obvious and so <span class="varspell" title="easy">easie</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="quenched">quench't</span>,<span class="line" id="line95"> [ 95 ]</span><br />
And <a href="" id="sense" class="annotBtn">not as feeling</a> through all parts <span class="varspell" title="diffused">diffus'd</span>,<br />
That she might look at will through every pore?<br />
Then had I not been thus <span class="varspell" title="exiled">exil'd</span> from light;<br />
As in the land of darkness yet in light,<br />

To live a life <a name="line100">half</a> dead, a living death,<span class="line" id="line100"> [ 100 ]</span><br />
And buried; but O yet more miserable!<br />
<a href="" id="self" class="annotBtn">My self, my Sepulcher,</a> a moving Grave,<br />
Buried, yet not exempt<br />
By <span class="varspell" title="privilege">priviledge</span> of death and burial<br />

From worst of other evils, pains and wrongs,<span class="line" id="line105"> [ 105 ]</span><br />
But made hereby <a href="" id="obnoxious" class="annotBtn">obnoxious</a> more<br />
To all the miseries of life,<br />
Life in captivity<br />
Among <a href="" id="inhuman" class="annotBtn">inhuman foes</a>.<br />

But who are these? for with joint pace I hear<span class="line" id="line110"> [ 110 ]</span><br />
The tread of many feet <span class="varspell" title="steering">stearing</span> this way;<br />
Perhaps my enemies who come to stare<br />
At my affliction, and perhaps to insult,<br />
<span class="varspell" title="Their">Thir</span> daily practice to afflict me more.</p>

<p>
<a href="" id="chorus" class="annotBtn"><span class="sp" title="Chorus">Chor.</span></a>  This, this is he; softly a while,<span class="line" id="line115"> [ 115 ]</span><br />
Let us not break in upon him;<br />
O change beyond report, thought, or belief!<br />
See how he lies at random, carelessly <span class="varspell" title="diffused">diffus'd</span>,<br />
With <a href="" id="lanquish" class="annotBtn"><span class="varspell" title="languished">languish't</span> head</a> <span class="varspell" title="unpropped">unpropt</span>,<br />

As one past hope, <span class="varspell" title="abandoned">abandon'd</span>,<span class="line" id="line120"> [ 120 ]</span><br />
And by himself given over;<br />
In slavish habit, ill-fitted <a href="" id="weeds" class="annotBtn">weeds</a><br />

Irresistible <span class="mi">Samson</span>? whom <span class="varspell" title="unarmed">unarm'd</span><br />
No strength of man, or fiercest wild beast could withstand;<br />
Who <a href="" id="tore" class="annotBtn">tore the Lion,</a> as the Lion tears the Kid,<br />
Ran on <span class="varspell" title="embattled">embattelld</span> Armies clad in Iron,<br />

And weaponless himself,<span class="line" id="line130"> [ 130 ]</span><br />
<a href="" id="arms" class="annotBtn">Made Arms ridiculous,</a> useless the forgery<br />

But safest he who stood aloof,<span class="line" id="line135"> [ 135 ]</span><br />
When insupportably his foot <span class="varspell" title="advanced">advanc't</span>,<br />
In scorn of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> proud arms and warlike <a href="" id="tools" class="annotBtn">tools,</a><br />
<span class="varspell" title="Spurned">Spurn'd</span> them to death by Troops. The bold <a href="" id="ascalon" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ascalonite</span></a><br />

In <a href="" id="ramath" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Ramath-lechi</span></a> famous to this day:<span class="line" id="line145"> [ 145 ]</span><br />
Then by main force <span class="varspell" title="pulled">pull'd</span> up, and on his shoulders bore<br />
The Gates of <a href="" id="azza" class="annotBtn"><span class="mi">Azza,</span></a> Post, and <span class="varspell" title="massy">massie</span> Bar<br />
Up to the Hill by <span class="mi">Hebron,</span> seat of Giants old,<br />
No journey of a <a href="" id="sabbathjourney" class="annotBtn">Sabbath day</a>, and loaded so;<br />

Like <a href="" id="atlas" class="annotBtn">whom</a> the Gentiles feign to bear up <span class="varspell" title="Heaven">Heav'n</span>.<span class="line" id="line150"> [ 150 ]</span><br />

To incorporate with gloomy night;<br />
For <a href="" id="light2" class="annotBtn">inward light</a> alas<br />

O mirror of our fickle state,<br />

Since man on earth <span class="varspell" title="unparalleled">unparallel'd</span>!<span class="line" id="line165"> [ 165 ]</span><br />

For him I reckon not in <a href="" id="high" class="annotBtn">high estate</a><span class="line" id="line170"> [ 170 ]</span><br />

When all abroad was <span class="varspell" title="rumored">rumour'd</span> that this day<span class="line" id="line1600"> [ 1600 ]</span><br />

All with incredible, <span class="varspell" title="stupendous">stupendious</span> force,<br />
None daring to appear Antagonist.<br />
At length for intermission sake they led him<br />

Between the pillars; he his guide requested<span class="line" id="line1630"> [ 1630 ]</span><br />
(For so from such as nearer stood we heard)<br />
As over-<span class="varspell" title="tired">tir'd</span> to let him lean a while<br />

A life Heroic, on his Enemies<br />

Visit his Tomb with flowers, only bewailing<br />

From whence captivity and loss of eyes.
