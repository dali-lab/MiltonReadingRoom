They had been withheld in 1673, probably because of thenotoriety of the men whom they praised – leading figures of the Civil War andCommonwealth – and because in them Milton affirmed his commitment to theCommonwealth and the pursuit of liberty. (<a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#stella_revard\" target=\"main\">Revard</a> 354)</blockquote><p>These four sonnets were first published in Edward Phillips\'s \"Life of Milton,\" prefixed to <a href=\"http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&res_id=xri:eebo&rft_id=xri:eebo:image:60630:26\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Letters of State</span></a> in 1694 on pages xlv-xlviii. They also appear in the Trinity Manuscript, the copytext for this edition.</p>  <p class=\"next\">Milton addressed Sonnet 17 to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Vane_the_Younger\" target=\"main\">Sir Henry Vane</a> (1613-1662) in celebration of Vane\'s  courageous positions on religious toleration and the separation of church and state. Vane the Younger, as he was called out of respect for his father of the same name, often opposed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_cromwell\" target=\"main\">Oliver Cromwell\'s</a> more moderate policies (<a href=\"../../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#Flannagan\" target=\"main\">Flannagan</a> 291).  Milton wrote this sonnet in 1652 as Cromwell and the Council of State were considering proposals, put forward by the Committee for the Propagation of the Gospel, for the settlement of the English church and the suppression of \"heresies\" and \"blasphemies.\"  The poem praises Vane\'s efforts to bring about peace with the Netherlands and to negotiate the re-unification of England and Scotland, but also, like Sonnet 16, implies approval for a course of disestablishment and relatively broad religious freedom.  During the restoration of Charles II, Vane was executed for \"crimes against England.\"  Following his death Vane\'s first biographer, George Sikes, included this sonnet in <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/54309\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The Life and Death of Sir Henry Vane</span></a> (1662).
