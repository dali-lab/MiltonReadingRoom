The sonnet first appeared as the introduction for <span class=\"booktitle\">Choice Psalms</span> by William and Henry Lawes (1648), a volume dedicated by lawes to the imprisoned King Charles I and in memory of his recently deceased father.  In 1630, <a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon47.html\" target=\"main\">Charles I</a> selected Lawes to join his \"Private Musicke.\"  During the 1630s, Lawes and Milton cultivated their relationship, both professionally and personally. They collaborated on <span class=\"booktitle\">A Mask at Ludlow</span>  with Lawes composing the music.  In addition to his work with Milton, Lawes prided himself on his ability to compose music that captured the essence of lyric poems.  This reputation encouraged Jonson, Donne, Herrick, Phillips, Cartwright, Carew and others to seek out his talents.   In contrast to the final title, \"To Mr. H. Lawes, on his Aires,\" the Trinity MS has Sonnet 13 twice on the same leaf and again two leaves following, each with a different title.  The first instance carries the following title:</p><blockquote class=\"mcenter\">13<br />To my freind M<span class=\"msuper\">r</span> Hen. Laws  Feb. 9. 1645</blockquote><p>The second has the following title:</p><blockquote class=\"mcenter\">13<br />To M<span lang=\"msuper\">r</span>: Hen: Laws on the publishing of his Aires</blockquote><p>The third has the following title:</p><blockquote class=\"mcenter\">13<br /><br />To M<span class=\"msuper\">r</span>: H<span class=\"mstrike\">en.</span> Law<span class=\"msuper\">e</span>s on <span class=\"mstrike\">the publishing of</span> his Aires</blockquote><p><span class=\"author\">Collin O\'Mara and Amar Dhand</span></span>",
