How long he expected the \"full circle\" of his studies to take is not known, but in 1638, he started a tour of Europe, principally Italy, and interrupted that trip early in 1639, returning to London where he started a school. Now, in 1641, he claims his studies are still incomplete, though he feels certainly up to the task in hand.

A speaking Picture, with this end to teach and delight. Of this have bene three generall kindes, the chiefe both in antiquitie and excellencie, were they that did imitate the unconceivable excellencies of God.

Milton already had taken much the same oath when he commenced B.A. and M.A. (1632) at Cambridge. He may since have decided that he could no longer subscribe to such an oath, or he may be thinking of the <a href=\"http://history.hanover.edu/texts/ENGref/er96.html\" target=\"main\">\"Et Cetera Oath\" of 1640</a> which includes the promise \"nor will I ever give my consent to alter the government of this Church by arcbbishops, bishops, deans, and archdeacons, &amp;c., as it stands now established, and as by right it ought to stand.\" Though the context suggests that this clause was meant to proscribe \"popish\" doctrines and innovations, a strict interpretation would certainly have proscribed the very action Milton took in writing this tract.
