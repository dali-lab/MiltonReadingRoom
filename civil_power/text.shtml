Yet not for this cause only do I require or trust to <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> acceptance, but in a two-fold respect besides: first, as bringing <span class="varspell" title="clear">cleer</span> evidence of scripture and protestant maxims to the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> of </span>England<span class="mi">, who in all <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> late acts, upon occasion, have <span class="varspell" title="professed">professd</span> to assert only the true protestant Christian religion, as it is <span class="" title="contained">containd</span> in the holy scriptures: next, in regard that your power being but for a time, and having in yourselves a Christian <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span> of your own, which at one time or other may be <span class="varspell" title="oppressed">oppressd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> truly sensible, it will concern you while you are in power, so to regard other <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span> consciences, as you would your own should be regarded in the power of others; and to consider that any law against conscience is alike in force against any conscience, and so may one way or other justly redound upon your selves. One advantage I make no doubt of, that I shall write to many eminent persons of your number, <span class="varspell" title="already">alreadie</span> <span class="varspell" title="perfect">perfet</span> and <span class="varspell" title="resolved">resolvd</span> in this important article of <span class="varspell" title="Christianity">Christianitie</span>. Some of whom I remember to have heard often for several years, at a <span class="varspell" title="council">councel</span> next in <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> to your own, so well joining religion with civil prudence, and yet so well distinguishing the different power of either, and this not only voting, but frequently reasoning why it should be so, that if any there present had <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> before of an opinion contrary, he might doubtless have departed thence a convert in that point, and have <span class="varspell" title="confessed">confessd</span> that then both commonwealth and religion will at length, if ever, flourish in Christendom, when either they who govern discern between civil and religious, or they only who so discern shall be admitted to govern. Till then, nothing but troubles, persecutions, commotions can be expected; the inward decay of true religion among our selves, and the utter overthrow at last by a common enemy. Of civil <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span> I have written heretofore by the appointment, and not without the approbation of civil power: of Christian liberty I write now; which others long since having <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> with all freedom under heathen emperors, I should do wrong to suspect that I now shall with less under Christian governors, and such especially as profess openly <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="defense">defence</span> of Christian <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>; although I write this not otherwise appointed or <span class="varspell" title="induced">induc'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by an inward <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> of the Christian <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> which I may usefully discharge <span class="varspell" title="herein">herin</span> to the common Lord and Master of us all, and the certain hope of his approbation, first and chiefest to be sought: in the hand of whose providence I remain, praying all success and good event on your <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> <span class="varspell" title="councils">councels</span>, to the <span class="varspell" title="defense">defence</span> of true religion and our civil rights.</span></p><br />

<p class="first">
<span class="minitial">T</span>Wo things there be which have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> ever found working much mischief to the church of God, and the advancement of truth; force on the one side restraining, and hire on the other side corrupting the teachers thereof. Few ages have <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> since the ascension of our <span class="Savior">Saviour</span>, <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> the one of these two, or both together have not <span class="varspell" title="prevailed">prevaild</span>. It can be at no time <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> unseasonable to speak of these things; since by them the church is either in continual detriment and oppression, or in continual danger. The former shall be at this time my argument; the latter as I shall finde God disposing me, and opportunity inviting. What I argue, shall be drawn from the scripture only; and <span class="varspell" title="therein">therin</span> from true fundamental principles of the gospel; to all knowing Christians undeniable. And if the governors of this commonwealth since the rooting out of prelats, have made least use of force in religion, and most have <span class="varspell" title="favored">favord</span> Christian liberty of any in this <span class="varspell" title="Island">Iland</span> before them since the first preaching of the gospel, for which we are not to forget our thanks to God, and their due praise; they may, I doubt not, in this treatise <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> that which not only will confirm them to defend still the Christian liberty which we enjoy, but will incite them also to enlarge it, if in aught they yet straiten it. To them who perhaps <span class="varspell" title="hereafter">herafter</span>, less <span class="varspell" title="experienced">experienc'd</span> in religion, may come to govern or give us laws, this or other such, if they please, may be a timely instruction: however, to the truth it will be at all times no unneedfull <span class="varspell" title="testimony">testimonie</span>; at least some discharge of that general <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> which no Christian but according to what he hath <span class="varspell" title="received">receivd</span> knows is <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> of him if he have aught more conducing to the advancement of religion <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> what is usually <span class="varspell" title="endeavored">endeavourd</span>, freely to impart it.
</p>


<p>
It will require no great labor of exposition to unfold what is here meant by matters of religion; being as soon apprehended as <span class="varspell" title="defined">defin'd</span>, such things as belong chiefly to the knowledge and service of God: and are either above the reach and light of nature without revelation from above, and <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> liable to be variously understood by <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> reason, or such things as are <span class="varspell" title="enjoined">enjoind</span> or forbidden by divine precept, which <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> by the light of reason would seem indifferent to be <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> or not <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>; and so likewise must needs <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeer</span> to <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> man as the precept is understood. Whence I here mean by conscience or religion, that full <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> whereby we are <span class="varspell" title="assured">assur'd</span> that our <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> and <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span>, as far as we are able to apprehend and probably make <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeer</span>, is according to the will of God &amp; his Holy Spirit within us, which we ought to follow much rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any law of man, as not only his word every where bids us, but the very dictate of reason tells us: <span class="mi"><abbr title="Acts">Act.</abbr></span> 4. 19. <span class="mi">whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken to you more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to God, judge ye.</span> That for <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> or <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span> in religion according to this conscientious <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span>, no man ought be <span class="varspell" title="punished">punishd</span> or molested by any outward force on earth whatsoever, I distrust not, through <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span>  <span class="varspell" title="implored">implor'd</span> assistance, to make <span class="varspell" title="plain">plane</span> by these following arguments.
</p>


<p>
First, it cannot be <span class="varspell" title="denied">deni'd</span>, being the main foundation of our protestant religion, that we of these ages, having no other divine rule or <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> from without us warrantable to <span class="varspell" title="one another">oneanother</span> as a common ground, but the holy scripture, and no other within us but the illumination of the Holy Spirit so interpreting that scripture as warrantable only to our selves and to such whose consciences we can so <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span>, can have no other ground in matters of religion but only from the scriptures. And these being not possible to be understood without this divine illumination, which no man can know at all times to be in himself, much less to be at any time for certain in any other, it follows <span class="varspell" title="clearly">cleerly</span> that no man or body of men in these times can be the infallible judges or determiners in matters of religion to any other <span class="varspell" title="men's">mens</span> consciences but their own. And <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> those Beroeans are commended, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Acts">Act.</abbr></span> 17.11, who after the preaching even of S. <span class="mi">Paul, <span class="varspell" title="searched">searchd</span> the scriptures daily, whether those things were so</span>. Nor did they more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> what God himself in many places commands us by the same apostle, to search, to try, to judge of these things ourselves: and gives us reason also, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 6. 4, 5. <span class="mi">Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another: for every man shall bear his own burden</span>. If then we count it so ignorant and irreligious in the papist to think himself <span class="varspell" title="discharged">dischargd</span> in <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> account, <span class="varspell" title="believing">beleeving</span> only as the church <span title="believes">beleevs</span>, how much greater condemnation will it be to the protestant his condemner, to think himself justified, <span class="varspell" title="believing">beleeving</span> only as the state <span title="believes">beleevs</span>? With good cause, <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span>, it is the general consent of all sound protestant writers that neither traditions, <span class="varspell" title="councils">councels</span> nor canons of any visible church, much less edicts of any magistrate or civil session, but the scripture only can be the final judge or rule in matters of religion, and that only in the conscience of every Christian to himself. Which protestation made by the first <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> reformers of our religion against the imperial edicts of <span class="varspell" title="Charles"><span class="mi">Charls</span></span> the fifth, imposing church-traditions without scripture, gave first beginning to the name of <span class="mi">Protestant</span>; and with that name hath ever <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="received">receivd</span> this doctrine, which <span class="varspell" title="prefers">preferrs</span> the scripture before the church, and acknowledges none but the Scripture sole interpreter of it self to the conscience. For if the church be not sufficient to be implicitly <span class="varspell" title="believed">beleevd</span>, as we hold it is not, what can there <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> be <span class="varspell" title="named">nam'd</span> of more <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the church but the conscience; <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> which God only is greater, I <span class="mi"><abbr>Joh.</abbr></span> 3.20? But if any man shall pretend, that the scripture judges to his conscience for other men, he makes himself greater not only <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the church, but also <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the scripture, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the consciences of other men; a presumption too high for any mortal; since every true Christian able to give a reason of his faith, hath the word of God before him, the <span class="varspell" title="promised">promisd</span> Holy Spirit, and the <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> of Christ within him, I <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 2.16; a much better and safer guide of conscience, which as far as concerns himself he may far more certainly know <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any outward rule <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> upon him by others whom he inwardly neither knows nor can know; at least knows nothing of them more sure <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> this one thing, that they cannot be his judges in religion, I <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 2. 15. <span class="mi">the spiritual man judgeth all things, but he himself is <span class="varspell" title="judged">judgd</span> of no man</span>. Chiefly for this cause do all true protestants account the pope antichrist, for that he assumes to himself this <span class="varspell" title="infallibility">infallibilitie</span> over both the conscience and the scripture; <span class="mi">sitting in the temple of God</span>, as it were opposite to God, <span class="mi">and exalting himself above all that is called God, or is <span class="varspell" title="worshiped">worshipd</span>,</span> 2 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 2.4. That is to say not only above all judges and magistrates, who though they be <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> gods are far beneath infallible, but also above God himself, by giving law both to the scripture, to the conscience, and to the spirit itself of God within us. Whenas we finde, <span class="mi">James</span> 4. 12, <span class="mi">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</span> That Christ is the only lawgiver of his church and that it is here meant in religious matters, no well grounded Christian will deny. Thus also <span class="mi"><abbr>S.</abbr> Paul</span>, <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 14. 4, <span class="mi">Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own Lord he standeth or falleth: but he shall stand; for God is able to make him stand.</span>
As <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> of one beyond expression bold and presumptuous, both these apostles demand, <span class="mi">who art thou</span> that <span class="varspell" title="presumest">presum'st</span> to impose other law or judgment in religion <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the only lawgiver and judge Christ, who only can save and can destroy, gives to the conscience? And the forecited place to the <span class="mi">Thessalonians</span> by <span class="varspell" title="compared">compar'd</span> effects <span class="varspell" title="resolves">resolvs</span> us, that be he or they who or wherever they be or can be, they are of far less <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the church, whom in these things as protestants they receive not, and yet no less antichrist in this main point of antichristianism, no less a pope or popedom <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he at <span class="mi">Rome</span>, if not much more; by setting up <span class="varspell" title="supreme">supream</span> interpreters of scripture either those doctors whom they follow, or, which is far worse, themselves as a civil <span class="varspell" title="papacy">papacie</span> assuming unaccountable <span class="varspell" title="supremacy">supremacie</span> to themselves not in civil only but  ecclesiastical causes. Seeing then that in matters of religion, as hath been <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span>, none can judge or <span class="varspell" title="determine">determin</span> here on earth, no not church-governors themselves against the consciences of other <span class="varspell" title="believers">beleevers</span>, my inference is, or rather not mine but our <span class="Saviors">Saviours</span> own, that in those matters they neither can command nor use constraint; lest they run rashly on a pernicious consequence, <span class="varspell" title="forwarned">forewarnd</span> in that parable <span class="mi"><abbr title="Matthew">Mat.</abbr></span> 13. from the 26 to the 31 verse: <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="lest">least</span> while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares &amp;c.</span> whereby he declares that this work neither his own ministers nor any <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> can discerningly <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> or judgingly perform without his own <span class="varspell" title="immediate">immediat</span> direction, in his own fit season; and that they ought till then not to attempt it. Which is further <span class="varspell" title="confirmed">confirmd</span> 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 1.24, <span class="mi">not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy.</span> If apostles had no dominion or constraining power over faith or conscience, much less have ordinary ministers: I <span class="mi"><abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr></span> 5.2,3. <span class="mi">feed the flock of God not by constraint &amp;c. neither as being lords over <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> heritage.</span> But some will object, that this overthrows all church-discipline, all censure of errors, if no man can <span class="varspell" title="determine">determin</span>. My answer is, that what they hear is <span class="varspell" title="plain">plane</span> scripture; which forbids not church-sentence or determining, but as it
ends in violence upon the conscience <span class="varspell" title="unconvinced">unconvinc'd</span>. Let who so will interpret or <span class="varspell" title="determine">determin</span>, so it be according to true church-discipline; which is <span class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> on them only who have willingly <span class="varspell" title="joined">joind</span> themselves in that <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span> of union, and proceeds only to a separation from the rest, proceeds never to any corporal <span class="varspell" title="enforcement">inforcement</span> or <span class="varspell" title="forfeiture">forfeture</span> of <span class="varspell" title="money">monie</span>, which in <a href="" id="spiritual" class="annotBtn">spiritual</a> things are the two arms of Antichrist, not of the true church; the one being an inquisition, the other no better <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a temporal indulgence of sin for <span class="varspell" title="money">monie</span>, whether by the church exacted or by the magistrate; both the one and the other a temporal satisfaction for what Christ hath satisfied eternally; a popish commuting of <span class="varspell" title="penalty">penaltie</span>, corporal for spiritual; a satisfaction to man especially to the magistrate, for what and to whom we owe none: these and more are the injustices of force and fining in religion, besides what I most insist on, the violation of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> express commandment in the gospel, as hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> <span class="varspell" title="shown">shewn</span>. Thus then if church-governors cannot use force in religion, though but for this reason, because they cannot infallibly <span class="varspell" title="determine">determin</span> to the conscience without convincement, much less have civil magistrates <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> to use force where they can much less judge; unless they mean only to be the civil executioners of them who have no civil power to give them such commission, no nor yet ecclesiastical to any force or violence in religion. To <span class="varspell" title="sum">summe</span> up all in brief, if we must <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> as the magistrate appoints, why not rather as the church? if not as either without convincement, how can force be <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span>? But some are ready to cry out, what shall then be <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> to <span class="varspell" title="blasphemy">blasphemie</span>? Them I would first exhort not thus to <span class="varspell" title="terrify">terrifie</span> and pose the people with a Greek word: but to teach them better what it is; being a most usual and common word in that language to <span class="varspell" title="signify">signifie</span> any slander, any <span class="varspell" title="malicious">malitious</span> or evil speaking, whether against God or man or anything to good belonging: <span class="varspell" title="blasphemy">blasphemie</span> or evil speaking against God <span class="varspell" title="maliciously">malitiously</span>, is far from conscience in religion; according to that of <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Mark">Marc</span> 9. 39, there is none who doth a <span class="varspell" title="powerful">powerfull</span> work in my name, and can likely speak evil of me.</span> If this suffice not, I <span class="varspell" title="refer">referre</span> them to that prudent and well deliberated act, <span class="mi">August 9</span>. 1650; where the <span class="varspell" title="Parliament">Parlament</span> defines <span class="varspell" title="blasphemy">blasphemie</span> against God, as far as it is a crime belonging to civil judicature, <span class="mi">pleni&ugrave;s ac meli&ugrave;s Chrysippo et Crantore</span>; in <span class="varspell" title="plain">plane</span> English, more warily more judiciously, more orthodoxally <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> twice <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> number of divines have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span> in many a prolix volume: although in all likelihood they whose whole <span class="varspell" title="study">studie</span> and profession these things are should be most intelligent and authentic <span class="varspell" title="therein">therin</span>, as they are for the most part, yet neither they nor these unerring always, or infallible. But we shall not <span class="varspell" title="carry">carrie</span> it thus; another Greek apparition stands in our way, <span class="mi">heresie</span> and <span class="mi">heretic</span>; in like manner also <span class="varspell" title="railed">rail'd</span> at to the people as in a tongue unknown. They should first interpret to them that <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> by what it signifies in that language, is no word of evil note; meaning only the <span class="varspell" title="choice">choise</span> or following of any opinion good or bad in religion, or any other learning: and thus not only in heathen authors but in the New testament it self, without censure or blame. <span class="mi">Acts</span> 15. 5. <span class="mi">certain of the <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> of the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span> which <span class="varspell" title="believed">beleevd</span></span>. and 26. 5 <span class="mi">after the exactest <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> of our religion I <span class="varspell" title="lived">livd</span> a <span class="varspell" title="Pharisee">Pharise</span>.</span> In which sense Presbyterian or Independent may without reproach be <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> a <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span>. Where it is mentiond with blame, it seems to differ little from schism 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 11. 18, 19 <span class="mi">I hear that there be schisms among you</span> &amp;c. <span class="mi">for there must also heresies be among you</span> &amp;c; though some, who write of <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> after their own heads, would make it far worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> schism; whenas on the <span class="varspell" title="contrary">contrarie</span>, schism signifies division, and in the worst sense; <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span>, <span class="varspell" title="choice">choise</span> only of one opinion before another, which may bee without discord. In apostolic times <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> ere the scripture was written, <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> was a <span class="varspell" title="doctrine">doctrin</span> <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintaind</span> against the <span class="varspell" title="doctrine">doctrin</span> by them <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span>: which in these times can be no otherwise <span class="varspell" title="defined">defin'd</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a <span class="varspell" title="doctrine">doctrin</span> <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintaind</span> against the light, which we now only have, of the scripture. Seeing <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> that no man, no synod, no session of men, though <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> the church, can judge definitively the sense of scripture to another <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> conscience, which is well known to be a general maxim of the Protestant religion, it follows <span class="varspell" title="plainly">planely</span> that he who holds in religion that <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> or those opinions which to his conscience and utmost understanding <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeer</span> with most evidence or <span class="varspell" title="probability">probabilitie</span> in the scripture, though to others he seem erroneous, can no more be justly <span class="varspell" title="censured">censur'd</span> for a heretic <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> his censurers; who do but the same thing themselves while they censure him for so doing. For ask them, or any Protestant, which hath most <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span>, the church or the scripture? they will answer, doubtless, that the scripture: and what hath most <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span>, that no doubt but they will confess is to be <span class="varspell" title="followed">followd</span>. He then who to his best apprehension follows the scripture, though against any point of doctrine by the whole church <span class="varspell" title="received">receivd</span>, is not the heretic; but he who follows the church against his conscience and <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> grounded on the scripture. To make this yet more undeniable, I shall only borrow a <span class="varspell" title="plain">plane</span> <span class="varspell" title="simile">similie</span>, the same which our own writers, when they would demonstrate <span class="varspell" title="plainest">planest</span> that we rightly <span class="varspell" title="prefer">preferre</span> the scripture before the church, use frequently against the Papist in this manner. As the Samaritans <span class="varspell" title="believed">beleevd</span> Christ, first for the <span class="varspell" title="woman's">womans</span> word, but next and much rather for his own, so we the scripture; first on the <span class="varspell" title="church's">churches</span> word, but afterwards and much more for its own, as the word of God; yea, the church itself we <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> for the scripture. The inference of itself follows: if by the Protestant doctrine we <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> the scripture not for the <span class="varspell" title="church's">churches</span> saying but for its own as the word of God, then ought we to <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> what in our conscience we apprehend the scripture to say, though the visible church with all her doctors gainsay; and being taught to <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> them only for the scripture, they who so do are not heretics, but the best protestants: and by their opinions, whatever they be, can hurt no protestant, whose rule is not to receive them but from the scripture: which to interpret convincingly to his own conscience none is able but himself guided by the Holy Spirit; and not so guided, none <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he to himself can be a worse deceiver. To protestants, <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span>, whose common rule and touchstone is the scripture, nothing can with more conscience, more <span class="varspell" title="equity">equitie</span>, nothing more protestantly can be permitted <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a free and lawful debate at all times by writing, conference or disputation of what opinion soever, disputable by scripture: concluding, that no man in religion is properly a heretic at this day, but he who maintains traditions or opinions not probable by scripture; who, for aught I know, is the papist only; he the only heretic, who counts all heretics but himself. Such as these, indeed, were capitally <span class="varspell" title="punished">punishd</span> by the law of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, as the only true heretics, idolaters, <span class="varspell" title="plain">plane</span> and open deserters of God and his known law: but in the gospel such are punished by excommunion only. <span class="mi"><abbr title="Titus">Tit.</abbr></span> 3.10. <span class="mi">an heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject.</span>  But they who think not this <span class="varspell" title="heavy">heavie</span> <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, and understand not that <span class="varspell" title="dreadful">dreadfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="awe">aw</span> and spiritual <span class="varspell" title="efficacy">efficacie</span> which the apostle hath <span class="varspell" title="expressed">expressd</span> so highly to be in church-discipline, 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 10. of which anon, and think weakly that the church of God cannot long subsist but in a <span class="varspell" title="bodily">bodilie</span> fear, for want of other <span class="varspell" title="proof">prooff</span> will needs wrest that place of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr></span> 13. to set up civil inquisition, and give power to the magistrate both of civil judgment and punishment in causes ecclesiastical. But let us see with what strength of argument. <span class="mi">Let every soul be subject to the higher powers.</span> First, how prove they that the apostle means other powers <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> such as they to whom he writes were then under; who <span class="varspell" title="meddled">medld</span> not at all in ecclesiastical causes, unless as tyrants and persecutors; and from them, I hope, they will not derive either the right of magistrates to judge in spiritual things or the <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> of such our obedience.  How prove they next that he <span class="varspell" title="entitles">intitles</span> them here to spiritual causes, from whom he witheld, as much as in him lay, the judging of civil; 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 6.1, &amp;c. If he himself <span class="varspell" title="appealed">appeald</span> to <span class="mi"><span class="varsepll" title="Caesar">Cesar</span></span>, it was to judge his innocence, not his religion. <span class="mi">For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil</span>. then are they not a terror to conscience, which is the rule or judge of good works grounded on the scripture. But <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span>, they say, is <span class="varspell" title="reckoned">reck'nd</span> among evil works <span class="mi"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 5. 20: as if all evil works were to be <span class="varspell" title="punished">punishd</span> by the magistrate; <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> this place, <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own citation, <span class="varspell" title="reckons">reck'ns</span> up besides <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> a sufficient number to confute them; <span class="mi">uncleanness, wantonness, <span class="varspell" title="enmity">enmitie</span>, strife, emulations, animosities, contentions, envyings</span>; all which are far more <span class="mi">manifest</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="judged">judgd</span> by him <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span>, as they define it; and yet I suppose they will not subject these evil works nor many more such like to his cognisance and punishment. <span class="mi">Wilt thou then not be <span class="varspell" title="afraid">affraid</span> of the power? do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same.</span> This <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> that religious matters are not here meant; <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> from the power here spoken of they could have no praise. <span class="mi">For he is the minister of God to thee for good.</span> true; but in that office and to that end and by those means which in this place must be <span class="varspell" title="clearly">cleerly</span> found, if from this place they intend to argue.  And how for thy good by forcing, oppressing, and <span class="varspell" title="ensnaring">insnaring</span> thy conscience? Many are the ministers of God and <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> offices no less different <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> many; none more different <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> state and church-government. Who seeks to govern both must needs be worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> any lord <span class="varspell" title="prelate">prelat</span> or church pluralist: for he in his own <span class="varspell" title="faculty">facultie</span> and profession, the other not in his own and for the most part not <span class="varspell" title="thoroughly">throughly</span> understood makes himself <span class="varspell" title="supreme">supream</span> lord or pope of the church as far as his civil jurisdiction stretches, and all the ministers of God <span class="varspell" title="therein">therin</span>, his ministers, or his curates rather in the function <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>, not in the government: while he himself assumes to rule by
civil power things to be <span class="varspell" title="ruled">rul'd</span> only by spiritual: when as this very chapter <abbr title="verse">v.</abbr> 6 appointing him his peculiar office, which requires utmost attendance, forbids him this worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> church-plurality from that full and <span class="varspell" title="weighty">waightie</span> charge, <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> alone he is <span class="mi">the minister of God, attending continually on this very thing.</span> To little purpose will they here instance <span class="mi">Moses</span>, who did all by immediate divine direction, no nor yet <span class="mi">Asa, Jehosaphat, or <span class="varspell" title="Josiah">Josia</span></span>, who both might when they <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleasd</span> receive answer from God, and had a commonwealth by him <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span> them, incorporated with a national church <span class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> more in bodily <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> in spiritual worship, so as that the church might be <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> a commonwealth and the whole commonwealth a church: nothing of which can be said of <span class="varspell" title="Christianity">Christianitie</span>, <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span> without the help of magistrates, yea in the midst of their opposition; how little then with any reference to them or mention of them, save <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> of our obedience to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> civil laws, as they <span class="varspell" title="countenance">countnance</span> good and <span class="varspell" title="deter">deterr</span> evil: which is the proper work of the magistrate, following in the same verse, and <span class="varspell" title="shows">shews</span> distinctly <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> he is the minister of God, <span class="mi">a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evil.</span> But we must first know who it is that doth evil: the heretic they say among the first. Let it be known then certainly who is a heretic: and that he who holds opinions in religion <span class="varspell" title="professedly">professdly</span> from tradition or his own inventions and not from Scripture but rather against it, is the only heretic; and yet though such, not <span class="varspell" title="always">alwaies</span> punishable by the magistrate, unless he do evil against a civil Law, properly so <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span>, hath been already <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> without need of repetition. <span class="mi">But if thou do that which is evil, be <span class="varspell" title="afraid">affraid</span>.</span> To do by scripture and the gospel according to conscience is not to do evil; if we <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> ought not to be <span class="varspell" title="afraid">affraid</span>, he ought not by his judging to give cause. causes <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> of Religion are not here meant. <span class="mi">For he beareth not the sword in vain.</span> Yes altogether in vain, if it smite he knows not what; if that for <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> which not the church it self, much less he, can determine absolutely to be so; if truth for error, being himself so often fallible, he bears the sword not in vain only, but unjustly and to evil. <span class="mi">Be subject not only for wrath, but for conscience sake</span>: how for conscience sake against conscience? By all these reasons it <span class="varspell" title="appears">appeers</span> <span class="varspell" title="plainly">planely</span> that the apostle in this place gives no judgment or coercive power to magistrates, neither to those then nor these now in matters of religion; and exhorts us no otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he exhorted those <span class="mi">Romans</span>. It hath now twice <span class="varspell" title="befallen">befaln</span> me to assert, through <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> assistance, this most wrested and <span class="varspell" title="vexed">vexd</span> place of scripture; heretofore against <span class="mi">Salmasius</span> and regal <span class="tyranny">tyranie</span> over the state; now against <span class="mi">Erastus</span> and state-<span class="tyranny">tyranie</span> over the church. If from such uncertain or rather such improbable grounds as these they endue <span class="varspell
" title="magistracy">magistracie</span> with spiritual judgment, they may as well invest him in the same spiritual <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> with power of utmost punishment, excommunication; and then turn spiritual into corporal, as no worse authors did then <span class="mi">Chrysostom, <span class="varpell" title="Jerome">Jerom</span></span>, and <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Augustine">Austin</span></span>, whom <span class="mi">Erasmus</span> and others in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> notes on the New Testament have cited to interpret that <span class="mi">cutting off</span> which <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span> <span class="varspell" title="wished">wishd</span> to them who had brought back the Galatians to circumcision, no less <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the amercement of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> whole <span class="varspell" title="virility">virilitie</span>; and <span class="mi">Grotius</span> <span class="varspell" title="adds">addes</span> that this concising punishment of circumcisers became a penal law <span class="varspell" title="thereupon">therupon</span> among the <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Visigoths">Visigothes</span>:</span> a dangerous example of beginning in the spirit to end so in the flesh: <span class="varspell" title="whereas">wheras</span> that cutting off much likelier seems meant a cutting off from the church, not unusually so <span class="varspell" title="termed">termd</span> in scripture, and a zealous imprecation, not a command. But I have <span class="varspell" title="termed">mentiond</span> this passage to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> how absurd they often prove who have not <span class="varspell" title="learned">learnd</span> to distinguish rightly between civil power and ecclesiastical. How many persecutions then, imprisonments, banishments penalties, and stripes; how much bloodshed have the forcers of conscience to answer for, and protestants rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> papists! For the papist, judging by his principles, punishes them who <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> not as the church <span title="believes">beleevs</span> though against the scripture; but the protestant, teaching every one to <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> the scripture though against the church, counts heretical and persecutes, against his own principles, them who in any particular so <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> as he in general teaches them; them who most honor and <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> divine scripture, but not against it any <span class="varspell" title="human">humane</span> interpretation though universal; them who interpret scripture only to themselves, which by his own position none but they to themselves can interpret; them who use the scripture no otherwise by his own doctrine to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> edification, then he himself uses it to <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> punishing: and so whom his doctrine acknowledges a true <span class="varspell" title="believer">beleever</span>, his discipline persecutes as a heretic. The papist exacts our <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> as to the church due above scripture; and by the church, which is the whole people of God, understands the pope, the general <span class="varspell" title="councils">councels</span> prelatical only and the <span class="varspell" title="surneamed">surnam'd</span> fathers: but the forcing protestant though he deny such <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> to any church whatsoever, yet takes it to himself and his teachers, of far less <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to be <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> the church and above scripture <span class="varspell" title="believed">beleevd</span>: which renders his <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span> both <span class="varspell" title="contrary">contrarie</span> to his <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span>, and far worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> which he condemns in the papist. By all which well <span class="varspell" title="considered">considerd</span>, the more he professes to be a true protestant, the more he hath to answer for his persecuting <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a papist. No protestant <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> of what sect soever following scripture only, which is the common sect <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> they all agree and the granted rule of <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> conscience to himself, ought, by the common doctrine of protestants, to be <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span> or molested for religion. But as for <span class="varspell" title="popery">poperie</span> and <span class="varspell" title="idolatry">idolatrie</span>, why they also may not hence plead to be tolerated, I have much less to say. Their religion the more <span class="" title="considered">considerd</span>, the less can be acknowledged a religion, but a Roman <span class="varspell" title="principality">principalitie</span> rather, <span class="varspell" title="endeavoring">endevouring</span> to keep up her old universal dominion under a new name and <span class="varspell" title="mere">meer</span> <span class="varspell" title="shadow">shaddow</span> of a catholic religion; being indeed more rightly <span class="varspell" title="named">nam'd</span> a catholic <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span> against the scripture; supported mainly by a civil, and, except in <span class="mi">Rome</span>, by a <span class="varspell" title="foreign">forein</span> power: justly <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> to be suspected, not tolerated by the magistrate of another <span class="varspell" title="country">countrey</span>. Besides, of an implicit faith, which they profess, the conscience also <span class="varspell" title="becomes">becoms</span> implicit; and so by <span class="varspell" title="vountary">voluntarie</span> servitude to <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> law, <span class="varspell" title="forfeits">forfets</span> her Christian <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>. Who then can plead for such a conscience, as being implicitly <span class="varspell" title="enthralled">enthrald</span> to man instead of God, almost <span class="varspell" title="becomes">becoms</span> no conscience, as the will not free, <span class="varspell" title="becomes">becoms</span> no will. Nevertheless, if they ought not to be tolerated, it is for just reason of state more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> of religion; which they who force, though professing to be protestants, deserve as little to be tolerated themselves, being no less <span class="varspell" title="guilty">guiltie</span> of <span class="varspell" title="popery">poperie</span> in the most popish point. Lastly, for <span class="varspell" title="idolatry">idolatrie</span>, who knows it not to be evidently against all scripture both of the Old and New Testament, and <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> a true <span class="varspell" title="heresy">heresie</span>, or rather an <span class="varspell" title="impiety">impietie</span>; <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> a right conscience can have naught to do; and the works <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> so manifest, that a magistrate can hardly err in prohibiting and quite removing at least the <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> and scandalous use <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span>.

<p>
From the riddance of these objections, I proceed yet to another reason why it is <span class="varspell" title="unlawful">unlawfull</span> for the civil magistrate to use force in matters of religion; which is, because to judge in those things, though we should grant him able, which is <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> he is not, yet as a civil magistrate he hath no right. Christ hath a government of his own sufficient of it self to all his ends and purposes in governing his church; but much different from that of the civil magistrate; and the difference in this <span class="varspell" title="very">verie</span> thing principally consists, that it governs not by outward force, and that for two reasons. First, because it deals only with the inward man and his actions, which are all spiritual and to outward force not <span class="varspell" title="liable">lyable</span>: secondly, to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us the divine excellence of his spiritual kingdom, able without worldly force to subdue all the powers and kingdoms of this world, which are upheld by outward force only. That the inward man is nothing <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> but the inward part of man, his understanding and his will, and that his actions thence proceeding, yet not simply thence but from the work of divine grace upon them, are the whole matter of religion under the gospel, will <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeer</span> <span class="varspell" title="plainly">planely</span> by considering what that religion is; whence we shall perceive yet more <span class="varspell" title="plainly">planely</span> that it cannot be <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span>. What evangelic religion is, is told in two words, faith and <span class="varspell" title="charity">charitie</span>, or <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> and <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span>. That both these flow, either the one from the understanding, the other from the will, or both jointly from both, once indeed naturally free, but now only as they are <span class="varspell" title="regenerate">regenerat</span> and wrought on by divine grace, is in part evident to common sense and principles <span class="varspell" title="unquestioned">unquestiond</span>, the rest by scripture: concerning our <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span>, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Matthew">Mat.</abbr></span> 16. 17. <span class="mi">flesh and blood hath not <span class="varspell" title="revealed">reveald</span> it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven:</span> concerning our <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span>, as it is religious and not <span class="varspell" title="merely">meerly</span> civil, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 5. 22, 23 and other places, declare it to be the fruit of the spirit only. Nay, our whole practical <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> in religion is <span class="varspell" title="contained">containd</span> in <span class="varspell" title="charity">charitie</span>, or the love of God and our <span class="varspell" title="neighbor">neighbour</span>, no way to be <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span>, yet the fulfilling of the whole law; that is to say, our whole <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span> in religion. If then both our <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> and <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span>, which comprehend our whole religion, flow from faculties of the inward man, free and unconstrainable of themselves by nature, and our <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span> not only from faculties <span class="varspell" title="endued">endu'd</span> with freedom, but from love and <span class="varspell" title="charity">charitie</span> besides, incapable of force, and all these things by transgression lost, but <span class="varspell" title="renewed">renewd</span> and regenerated in us by the power and gift of God alone, how can such religion as this admit of force from man, or force be any way <span class="varspell" title="applied">appli'd</span> to such religion, especially under the free offer of grace in the gospel but it must forthwith frustrate and make of no effect both the religion and the gospel? And that to <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> outward profession, which they will say perhaps ought to be <span class="varspell" title="compelled">compelld</span> though inward religion cannot, is to <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> <span class="varspell" title="hypocrisy">hypocrisie</span> not to advance religion, shall yet, though of itself <span class="varspell" title="clear">cleer</span> <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span>, be ere the conclusion further manifest. The other reason why Christ rejects outward force in the goverment of his church, is, as I said before, to <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> us the divine excellence of his spiritual kingdom, able without worldly force to subdue all the powers and kingdoms of this world, which are upheld by outward force only: by which to uphold religion otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to defend the religious from outward violence, is no service to Christ or his kingdom but rather a disparagement, and degrades it from a divine and spiritual kingdom to a kingdom of this world: which he denies it to be, because it needs not force to confirm it: <span class="mi"><abbr title="John">Joh.</abbr></span> 18. 36: <span class="mi">if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jewes.</span> This proves the kingdom of Christ not governd by outward force, as being none of this world, whose kingdoms are maintain'd all by force <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span>: and yet disproves not that a Christian commonwealth may defend itself against outward force in the cause of religion as well as in any other; though Christ himself, coming purposely to dye for us, would not be so defended. 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 1.27. <span class="mi">God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.</span> Then surely he hath not chosen the force of this world to subdue conscience and conscientious men, who in this world are counted weakest; but rather conscience, as being weakest, to subdue and regulate force, his adversarie, not his aide or instrument in governing the church: 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span>10. 3, 4, 5, 6. <span class="mi">for though we walk in the flesh, we do not <span class="varspell" title="war">warre</span> after the flesh: for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal; but <span class="varspell" title="mighty">mightie</span> through God to the pulling down of strong holds; casting down imaginations and <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> high thing that exalts it self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into <span class="varspell" title="captivity">captivitie</span> <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> thought to the obedience of Christ: and having in a readiness to <span class="varspell" title="avenge">aveng</span> all disobedience.</span>  It is evident by the first and second verses of this chapter, that the apostle here speaks of that spiritual power by which Christ governs his church, how allsufficient it is, how powerful to reach the conscience and the inward man with whom it chiefly deals, and whom no power <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> can deal with. In comparison of which as it is here thus magnificently <span class="varspell" title="described">describ'd</span>, how uneffectual and weak is outward force with all her boistrous <span class="varspell" title="tools">tooles</span>, to the shame of those Christians and especially those churchmen, who to the exercising of church discipline never cease calling on the civil magistrate to interpose his <span class="varspell" title="fleshly">fleshlie</span> force; an argument that all true ministerial and spiritual power is dead within them: who think the gospel, which both began and spread over the whole world for above three hundred years under heathen and persecuting emperors, cannot stand or continue, supported by the same divine presence and protection to the <span class="varspell" title="world's">worlds</span> end, much easier under the defensive favor <span class="varspell" title="only">onely</span> of a Christian magistrate, unless it be enacted and settled, as they call it, by the state, a statute or a state-religion: and understand not that the church itself cannot, much less the state, settle or impose one tittle of religion upon our obedience implicit, but can only recommend or propound it to our free and conscientious examination: unless they mean to set the state higher <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the church in religion, and with a <span class="varspell" title="gross">grosse</span> contradiction give to the state in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> settling petition that command of our implicit <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> which they deny in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="settled">setled</span> confession both to the state and to the church. Let them cease then to importune and interrupt the magistrate from attending to his own charge in civil and moral things, the settling of things just, things honest, the <span class="varspell" title="defense">defence</span> of things religious settled by the churches within themselves; and the repressing of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir </span>contraries determinable by the common light of nature, which is not to constrain or to repress religion, probable by scripture, but the violaters and persecuters <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span>: of all which things he hath <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> and more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to do, left yet <span class="varspell" title="undone">undon</span>, for which the land groans and justice goes to wrack the while: let him also forbear force where he hath no right to judge; for the conscience is not his province: <span class="varspell" title="lest">least</span> a worse <span class="mi">woe</span> arrive him, for worse offending, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> was denounced by our <span class="Savior">Saviour</span> <span class="mi"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr></span> 23. 23 against the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>: ye have <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span> the conscience, which was not to be <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span>; but judgment and mercy ye have not executed: this ye should have <span class="varspell" title="done">don</span>, and the other let alone. And since it is the <span class="varspell" title="council">councel</span> and set purpose of God in the gospel by spiritual means, which are counted weak, to <span class="varspell" title="overcome">overcom</span> all power which resists him; let them not go about to do that by worldly strength which he hath decreed to do by those means which the world counts weakness, <span class="varspell" title="lest">least</span> they be again obnoxious to that saying which in another place is also written of the <span class="varspell" title="Pharisees">Pharises</span>, <span class="mi">Luke</span> 7. 30 <span class="mi">that they frustrated the <span class="varspell" title="council">councel</span> of God.</span> The main plea is, and <span class="varspell" title="urged">urgd</span> with much vehemence to their imitation, that the kings of <span class="mi"><abbr title="Judah">Juda</abbr></span>, as I <span class="varspell" title="touched">touchd</span> before, and especially <span class="mi"><abbr title="Josiah">Josia</abbr></span> both <span class="varspell" title="judged">judgd</span> and <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> force in religion: 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr></span> 34. 33 <span class="mi">he made all that were present in Israel to serve the Lord their God:</span> an argument, if it be well weighed, worse <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that used by the false prophet <span class="mi">Shemaia</span> to the high priest, that in imitation of <span class="mi">Jehojada</span> he ought to put <span class="varspell" title="Jeremiah">Jeremie</span> in the stocks, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr></span> 29. 24, 26, &amp;c. for which he <span class="varspell" title="received">receivd</span> his due denouncement from God. But to this besides I return a threefold answer: first, that the state of religion under the gospel is far differing from what it was under the law: then was the state of rigor, childhood, bondage and works, to all which force was not unbefitting; now is the state of grace, manhood, freedom and faith, to all which belongs willingness and reason, not force: the law was then written on tables of stone, and to be <span class="varspell" title="performed">performd</span> according to the letter; willingly or unwillingly; the gospel, our new <span class="varspell" title="covenant">covnant</span>, upon the heart of every <span class="varspell" title="believer">beleever</span>, to be interpreted only by the sense of <span class="varspell" title="charity">charitie</span> and inward <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span>: the law had no distinct government or governors of church and commonwealth, but the Priests and Levites <span class="varspell" title="judged">judg'd</span> in all causes not ecclesiastical only, but civil, <span class="mi">Deut.</span> 17. 8, &amp;c. which under the gospel is forbidden to all church-ministers, as a thing which Christ <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> master in his <span class="varspell" title="ministry">ministerie</span> <span class="varspell" title="disclaimed">disclaim'd</span> <span class="mi">Luke</span> 12. 14; as a thing <span class="varspell" title="beneath">beneathe</span> them 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 6. 4; and by many of our statutes, as to them who have a peculiar and far-differing government of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own. If not, why different the governors? Why not church-ministers in state affairs as well as state-ministers in church affairs? If church and state shall be made one flesh again as under the law, let it be withall <span class="varspell" title="considered">considerd</span>, that God who then <span class="varspell" title="joined">joind</span> them hath now <span class="varspell" title="severed">severd</span> them; that which, he so ordaining, was then a <span class="varspell" title="lawful">lawfull</span> conjunction to such on either side as join again what he hath <span class="varspell" title="severed">severd</span> would be nothing now but <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own presumptuous fornication. Secondly, the kings of <span class="mi"><abbr title="Judah">Juda</abbr></span> and those magistrates under the law might have <span class="varspell" title="recourse">recours</span>, as I said before, to divine inspiration; which our magistrates under the gospel have not, more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to the same spirit, which those whom they force have oft times in greater measure <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> themselves: and so, instead of forcing the Christian, they force the Holy Ghost; and, against that wise forewarning of <span class="mi">Gamaliel</span>, fight against God. Thirdly, those kings and magistrates <span class="varspell" title="used">us'd</span> force in such things only as were undoubtedly known and forbidden in the law of <span class="mi">Moses</span>, <span class="varspell" title="idolatry">idolatrie</span> and direct <span class="varspell" title="apostasy">apostacie</span> from that national and strict <span class="varspell" title="enjoined">enjoind</span> worship of God; whereof the corporal punishment was by himself expressly set down: but magistrates under the gospel, our free, elective and rational worship, are most commonly busiest to force those things which in the gospel are either left free, nay <span class="varspell" title="sometmes">somtimes</span> <span class="varspell" title="abolished">abolishd</span> when by them <span class="varspell" title="compelled">compelld</span>, or <span class="varspell" title="else">els</span> controverted equally by writers on both sides, end <span class="varspell" title="sometmes">somtimes</span> with odds on that side which is against them. By which means they either punish that which they ought to favor and protect, or that with corporal punishment and of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own inventing, which not they but the church had <span class="varspell" title="received">receivd</span> command to chastise with a spiritual rod only. Yet some are so eager in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> zeal of forcing, that they refuse not to descend at length to the utmost shift of that parabolical <span class="varspell" title="proof">prooff</span>, <span class="mi">Luke</span> 14. 16, &amp;c. <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> them to come in</span>. <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> magistrates may <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> in religion. As if a parable were to be <span class="varspell" title="strained">straind</span> through <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> word or phrase, and not expounded by the general scope <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span>: which is no other here <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> the earnest expression of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> displeasure on those recusant <span class="varspell" title="Jews">Jewes</span>, and his purpose to <span class="varspell" title="prefer">preferre</span> the gentiles on any terms before them; <span class="varspell" title="expressed">expressd</span> here by the word <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span></span>. But how <span class="varspell" title="compels">compells</span> he? doubtless no otherwise <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> he draws, without which no man can come to him, <span class="mi"><abbr title="John">Joh.</abbr></span>6. 44: and that is by the inward <span class="varspell" title="persuasive">perswasive</span> motions of his spirit and by his ministers; not by the outward compulsions of a magistrate or his officers. The true people of Christ, as is foretold <span class="mi"><abbr title="Psalm">Psal.</abbr></span> 110. 3, <span class="mi">are a willing people in the day of his power</span>. then much more now when he rules all things by outward weakness, that both his inward power and their <span class="varspell" title="sincerity">sinceritie</span> may the more <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeer</span>. <span class="mi">God loveth a <span class="varspell" title="cheerful">chearfull</span> giver:</span>  then certainly is not <span class="varspell" title="pleased">pleasd</span> with an <span class="varspell" title="uncheerful">unchearfull</span> worshiper; as the <span class="varspell" title="very">verie</span> words declare of his evangelical invitations <span class="mi"><abbr title="Isaiah">Esa.</abbr></span> 55. 1. <span class="mi">ho, <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> one that thirsteth, come.</span> <span class="mi"><abbr title="John">Joh.</abbr></span> 7. 37 <span class="mi">if any man thirst. <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr></span> 3. 18, <span class="mi">I counsel thee.</span> and 22. 17. <span class="mi">whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</span> And in that grand commission of preaching, to invite all nations <span class="mi"><span class="varspell" title="Mark">Marc</span></span> 16. 16, as the reward of them who come, so the <span class="varspell" title="penalty">penaltie</span> of them who come not is only spiritual. But they bring now some reason with <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> force, which must not pass <span class="varspell" title="unanswered">unanswerd</span>; that the church of <span class="mi">Thyatira</span> was <span class="varspell" title="blamed">blam'd</span> <span class="mi"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr></span> 2. 20 for suffering the false <span class="mi">prophetess to teach and to seduce.</span> I answer, that seducement is to be <span class="varspell" title="hindered">hinderd</span> by fit and proper means <span class="varspell" title="ordained">ordaind</span> in church-discipline; by instant and <span class="varspell" title="powerful">powerfull</span> demonstration to the <span class="varspell" title="contrary">contrarie</span>; by opposing truth to error, no unequal match; truth the strong to error the weak though <span class="varspell" title="sly">slie</span> and shifting. Force is no honest confutation; but uneffectual, and for the most part <span class="varspell" title="unsuccessful">unsuccessfull</span>, oft times fatal to them who use it: sound doctrine, diligently and <span class="varspell" title="duly">duely</span> taught, is of herself both sufficient, and of herself (if some secret judgment of God hinder not) <span class="varspell" title="always">alwaies</span> prevalent against seducers. This the <span class="mi">Thyatirians</span> had neglected, suffering, against Church-discipline, that woman to teach and seduce among them: civil force they had not then in their power; being the Christian part only of that <span class="varspell" title="city">citie</span>, and then especially under one of those ten great persecutions wherof this the second was <span class="varspell" title="raised">raisd</span> by <span class="mi">Domitian:</span> force <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> in these matters could not be <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span> of them who were under force themselves.
</p>


<p>
I have <span class="varspell" title="shown">shewn</span> that the civil power hath neither right nor can do right by forcing religious things: I will now <span class="varspell" title="show">shew</span> the wrong it doth; by violating the fundamental privilege of the gospel, the new-birthright of <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> true <span class="varspell" title="believer">beleever</span>, Christian <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>. 2 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 3. 17. <span class="mi">where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>. <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 4. 26, <span class="mi">Jerusalem which is above, is free; which is the mother of us all.</span> and 31. <span class="mi">we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</span>  It will be sufficient in this place to say no more of Christian <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that it sets us free not only from the bondage of those ceremonies, but also from the forcible imposition of those circumstances, place and time in the worship of God: which though by him commanded in the old law, yet in respect of that veritie and freedom which is evangelical, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Paul</span> comprehends both <span class="varspell" title="kinds">kindes</span> alike, that is to say, both <span class="varspell" title="ceremony">ceremonie</span> and circumstance, under one and the same <span class="varspell" title="contemptuous">contemtuous</span> name of <span class="mi">weak and beggarly rudiments, <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 4. 3. 9, 10. <span class="mi">Col.</span> 2. 8. with 16: conformable to what our <span class="Savior">Saviour</span> himself taught <span class="mi">John</span> 4. 21, 23, <span class="mi">neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem.

These and other such places of scripture the best and learnedest reformed writers have thought evident <span class="varspell" title="enough">anough</span> to instruct us in our freedom not only from ceremonies, but from those circumstances also, though <span class="varspell" title="imposed">impos'd</span> with a confident <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span> of <span class="varspell" title="morality">moralitie</span> in them, which they hold impossible to be in place or time. By what warrant then our opinions and <span class="varspell" title="practices">practises</span> <span class="varspell" title="herein">herin</span> are of late <span class="varspell" title="turned">turnd</span> quite against all other Protestants, and that which is to them orthodoxal, to us become scandalous and punishable by statute, I wish were once again better <span class="varspell" title="considered">considerd</span>; if we mean not to <span class="varspell" title="proclaim">proclame</span> a schism in this point from the best and most reformed churches abroad. They who would seem more knowing, confess that these things are indifferent, but for that very cause by the magistrate may be commanded. As if God of his special grace in the gospel had to this end freed us from his own commandments in these things, that our freedom should subject us to a more <span class="varspell" title="grievous">greevous</span> yoke, the commandments of men. As well may the magistrate call that common or unclean which God hath <span class="varspell" title="cleansed">cleansd</span>, forbidden to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> <span class="mi">Peter Acts</span> 10. 15; as well may he <span class="varspell" title="loosen">loos'n</span> that which God hath <span class="varspell" title="straitened">strait'nd</span> or <span class="varspell" title="straiten">strait'n</span> that which God hath <span class="varspell" title="loosened">loos'nd</span>, as he may <span class="varspell" title="enjoin">injoin</span> those things in religion which God hath left free, and lay on that yoke which God hath taken off.

It will <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> not misbecome the meanest Christian to put in  <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> Christian magistrates, and so much the more freely by how much the more they desire to be thought Christian (for they will be thereby, as they ought to be in these things, the more our brethren and the less our lords) that they meddle not rashly with Christian <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>, the birthright and outward testimonie of our adoption: lest while they little think it, nay, think they do God service, they themselves like the sons of that bondwoman be found persecuting them who are <span class="varspell" title="freeborn">freeborne</span> of the spirit; and by a sacrilege of not the least aggravation bereaving them of that sacred <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span> which our <span class="Savior">Saviour</span> with his own blood <span class="varspell" title="purchased">purchas'd</span> for them.
</p>


<p>
A fourth reason why the magistrate ought not to use force in religion I bring from the consideration of all those ends which he can likely pretend to the interposing of his force <span class="varspell" title="therein">therin</span>: and those hardly can be other <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> first the <span class="varspell" title="glory">glorie</span> of God; next, either the spiritual good of them whom he forces, or the temporal punishment of their scandal to others. As for the promoting of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> glory, none, I think, will say that his <span class="varspell" title="glory">glorie</span> ought to be promoted in religious things by unwarrantable means, much less by means <span class="varspell" title="contrary">contrarie</span> to what he hath commanded. That outward force is such, and that <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> glory in the whole administration of the gospel according to his own will and <span class="varspell" title="council">councel</span> ought to be fulfilld by weakness, at least so refuted, not by force; or if by force, inward and spiritual, not outward and corporeal, is already <span class="varspell" title="proved">prov'd</span> at large. That outward force cannot tend to the good of him who is <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span> in religion, is unquestionable. For in religion whatever we do under the gospel, we ought to be <span class="varspell" title="thereof">therof</span> <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> without scruple; and are justified by the faith we have, not by the work we do. <span class="mi"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr></span> 14. 5. <span class="mi">Let every man be fully <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span> in his own mind.</span> The other reason which follows necessarily, is obvious <span class="mi"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 2. 16, and in many other places of St. <span class="mi">Paul</span>, as the groundwork and foundation of the whole gospel, that we are <span class="mi">justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law.</span> if not by the works of <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> law, how then by the injunctions of <span class="varspell" title="man's">mans</span> law? Surely force cannot work <span class="varspell" title="persuasion">perswasion</span>, which is faith; cannot <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> <span class="varspell" title="justify">justifie</span> nor <span class="varspell" title="pacify">pacifie</span> the conscience: and that which justifies not in the gospel, condemns, is not only not good, but <span class="varspell" title="sinful">sinfull</span> to do. <span class="mi"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr></span> 14. 23. <span class="mi">Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.</span>  It concerns the magistrate then to take heed how he forces in religion conscientious men: <span class="varspell" title="lest">least</span> by compelling them to do that <span class="varspell" title="whereof">wherof</span> they cannot be <span class="varspell" title="persuaded">perswaded</span>, that <span class="varspell" title="wherein">wherin</span> they cannot <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> themselves justified, but by <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own consciences <span class="varspell" title="condemned">condemnd</span>, instead of aiming at <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> spiritual good, he force them to do evil; and while he thinks himself <span class="mi">Asa, Josia, Nehemia</span>, he be found <span class="mi">Jeroboam</span>, who <span class="varspell" title="caused">causd</span> Israel to sin; and thereby draw upon his own head all those sins and shipwracks of implicit faith and <span class="varspell" title="conformity">conformitie</span>, which he hath <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span>, and all the wounds given to those <span class="mi">little ones,</span> whom to offend he will <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> worse one day <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that violent drowning mentioned <span class="mi"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr></span> 18. 6. Lastly as a preface to force, it is the usual pretense, That although tender consciences shall be tolerated, yet scandals thereby given shall not be un<span class="varspell" title="punished">punishd</span>, <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> and licentious men shall not be <span class="varspell" title="encouraged">encourag'd</span> to neglect the performance of religious and holy duties by color of any law giving <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span> to tender consciences. By which contrivance the way lies ready open to them <span class="varspell" title="hereafter">heerafter</span> who may be so minded, to take away by little and little that liberty which Christ and his gospel, not any magistrate, hath right to give: though this <span class="varspell" title="kind">kinde</span> of his giving be but to give with one hand and take away with the other, which is a deluding not a giving. As for scandals, if any man be offended at the conscientious liberty of another, it is a taken scandal not a given. To heal one conscience we must not wound another: and men must be exhorted to beware of scandals in Christian <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>, not <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span> by the magistrate; <span class="varspell" title="lest">least</span> while he goes about to take away the scandal, which is uncertain whether given or taken, he take away our liberty, which is the certain and the sacred gift of God, neither to be <span class="varspell" title="touched">touchd</span> by him nor to be parted with by us. None more cautious of giving scandal <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> St. <span class="mi">Paul</span>. Yet while he made himself <span class="mi">servant to all,</span> that he <span class="mi">might gain the more</span>, he made himself so of his own accord, was not made so by outward force, testifying at the same time that he <span class="mi">was free from all men</span>,
1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 9. 19; and <span class="varspell" title="thereafter">therafter</span> exhorts us also <span class="mi"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 5. 13. ye were <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> to <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span> &amp;c. <span class="mi">but by love serve one another:</span> then not by force.  As for that fear <span class="varspell" title="lest">least</span> <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> and licentious men should be <span class="varspell" title="encouraged">encourag'd</span> to omit the performance of religious and holy duties, how can that care belong to the civil magistrate, especially to his force? For if <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> and licentious persons must not neglect the performance of religious and holy duties, it implies, that such duties they can perform; which no Protestant will affirm. They who mean the outward performance, may so <span class="varspell" title="explain">explane</span> it; and it will then <span class="varspell" title="appear">appeer</span> yet more <span class="varspell" title="plainly">planely</span>, that such performance of religious and holy duties especialy by <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> and licentious persons, is a dishonoring rather <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> a worshiping of God; and not only by him not <span class="varspell" title="required">requir'd</span>, but detested: <span class="mi">Prov.</span> 21. 27. <span class="mi">the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked  <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span>?</span> To <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> the <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> to things holy in his <span class="varspell" title="profaneness">prophaneness</span>, is all one under the gospel, as to have <span class="varspell" title="compelled">compelld</span> the unclean to sacrifice in his uncleanness under the law. And I <span class="varspell" title="add">adde</span> withall, that to <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> the licentious in his licentiousness, and the conscientious against his conscience, <span class="varspell" title="comes">coms</span> all to one; tends not to the honor of God, but to the multiplying and the aggravating of sin to them both.  We read not that Christ ever <span class="varspell" title="exercised">exercis'd</span> force but once; and that was to drive <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> ones out of his temple, not to force them in: and if <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> <span class="varspell" title="being">beeing</span> there was an offense, we <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> by many other scriptures that <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> praying there was an abomination: and yet to the Jewish law that nation, as a servant, was <span class="varspell" title="obliged">oblig'd</span>; but to the gospel each person is left <span class="varspell" title="vountary">voluntarie</span>, <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> only, as a son, by the preaching of the word; not to be driven in by edicts and force of arms. For if by the apostle, <span class="mi"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr></span> 12.1, we are <span class="mi">beseechd</span> as <span class="mi">brethren by the mercies of God</span> to <span class="mi">present</span> our <span class="mi">bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is</span> our <span class="mi">reasonable service</span> or worship, then is no man to be <span class="varspell" title="forced">forc'd</span> by the compulsive laws of men to present his body a dead sacrifice, and so under the gospel most unholy and unacceptable, because it is his unreasonable service, that is to say, not only unwilling but unconscionable. But if <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> and licentious persons may not omit the performance of holy duties, why may they not partake of holy things? Why are they prohibited the <span class="varspell" title="Lord's">Lords</span> supper; since both the one and the other action may be outward; and outward performance of <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> may attain at least an outward participation of benefit? The church denying them that communion of grace and thanksgiving, as it justly doth, why doth the magistrate <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> them to the union of performing that which they neither truly can, being themselves unholy, and to do seemingly is both <span class="varspell" title="hateful">hatefull</span> to God, and perhaps no less dangerous to perform <span class="varspell" title="holy">holie</span> duties irreligiously <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> to receive holy signs or sacraments unworthily?  All <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> and licentious men, so known, can be <span class="varspell" title="considered">considerd</span> but either so without the church as never yet within it, or departed thence of <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own accord, or excommunicate: if never yet within the church, whom the apostle, and so consequently the church have naught to do to judge, as he professes 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 5. 12, <a href="" id="then" class="annotBtn">then</a> by what <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> doth the magistrate judge, or, which is worse <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> in relation to the church? if departed of his own accord, like that lost sheep <span class="mi">Luke</span> 15. 4, &amp;c. the true church either with her own or any <span class="varspell" title="borrowed">borrowd</span> force worries him not in again, but rather in all charitable manner sends after him; and if she <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> him, layes him gently on her shoulders; bears him, yea bears his burdens; his errors, his infirmities any way tolerable, <span class="mi">so fulfilling the law of Christ, <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span> 6. 2: if excommunicate, whom the church hath bid go out, in whose name doth the magistrate <span class="varspell" title="compel">compell</span> to go in? The church indeed hinders none from hearing in her <span class="varspell" title="public">publick</span> congregation, for the doors are open to all: nor excommunicates to destruction, but, as much as in her lies, to a final saving. Her meaning <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> must needs <span class="varspell" title="be">bee</span>, that as her driving out brings on no outward <span class="varspell" title="penalty">penaltie</span>, so no outward force or <span class="varspell" title="penalty">penaltie</span> of an improper and only a destructive power should drive in again her infectious sheep; <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span> sent out because infectious, and not driven in but with the danger not only of the whole and sound, but also of his own utter perishing. Since force neither instructs in religion nor begets repentance or amendment of life, but, on the <span class="varspell" title="contrary">contrarie</span>, hardness of heart, <span class="varspell" title="formality">formalitie</span>, <span class="varspell" title="hypocrisy">hypocrisie</span>, and, as I said before, <span class="varspell" title="every">everie</span> way increase of sin; more and more alienates the  <span class="varspell" title="mind">minde</span> from a violent religion expelling out and compelling in, and reduces it to a condition like that which the <span class="mi">Britains</span> complain of in our <span class="varspell" title="story">storie</span>, driven to and fro between the <span class="mi">Picts</span> and the sea. If after excommunion he be found intractable, incurable, and will not hear the church, he <span class="varspell" title="becomes">becoms</span> as one never yet within her pale, <span class="mi">a heathen or a publican, <abbr title="Matthew">Mat.</abbr></span> 18. 17; not further to be <span class="varspell" title="judged">judgd</span>, no not by the magistrate, unless for civil causes; but left to the final sentence of that judge, whose coming shall be in flames of fire; that <span class="mi">Maran atha</span>, 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 16. 22; <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> which to him so left nothing can be more dreadful and ofttimes to him particularly nothing more <span class="varspell" title="speedy">speedie</span>, that is to say, the Lord cometh: In the mean while <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span> up to Satan, 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr></span> 5. 5. 1 <span class="mi"><abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr></span> 1. 20. that is, from the fould of Christ and kingdom of grace to the world again which is the kingdom of Satan; and as he was <span class="varspell" title="received">receivd</span> <span class="mi">from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God</span> <span class="mi">Acts</span> 26. 18, so now <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span> up again from light to darkness, and from God to the power of Satan; yet so as is in both places manifested, to the intent of saving him, brought sooner to contrition by spiritual <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> by any corporal <span class="varspell" title="severity">severitie</span>. But grant it belonging any way to the magistrate, that <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span> and licentious persons omit not the performance of holy duties, which in them were odious to God even under the law, much more now under the gospel, yet ought his care both as a magistrate and a Christian to be much more that conscience be not inwardly violated, <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> that license in these things be made outwardly conformable: since his part is undoubtedly as a Christian, which puts him upon this office much more <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> as a magistrate, in all respects to have more care of the conscientious <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> of the <span class="varspell" title="profane">prophane</span>; and not for their sakes to take away (while they <a href="" id="pretend" class="annotBtn">pretend</a> to give) or to diminish the <span class="varspell" title="rightful">rightfull</span> <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span> of religious consciences.
</p>

<p>
On these four scriptural reasons as on a firm square this truth, the right of Christian and evangelic liberty, will stand immoveable against all those pretended consequences of license and confusion, which for the most part men most licentious and <span class="varspell" title="confused">confus'd</span> themselves, or such as whose <span class="varspell" title="severity">severitie</span> would be wiser <span class="varspell" title="than">then</span> divine wisdom, are ever aptest to object against the <span class="varspell" title="ways">waies</span> of God: as if God without them when he gave us this <span class="varspell" title="liberty">libertie</span>, knew not of the worst which these men in <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> arrogance pretend will follow: yet knowing all their worst, he gave us this liberty as by him <span class="varspell" title="judged">judgd</span> best. As to those magistrates who think it their work to settle religion, and those ministers or others, who so oft call upon them to do so, I trust, that having well <span class="varspell" title="considered">considerd</span> what hath <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> here <span class="varspell" title="argued">argu'd</span>, neither they will continue in that intention, nor these in that expectation from them: when they shall <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> that the settlement of religion belongs only to each particular church by <span class="varspell" title="persuasive">perswasive</span> and spiritual means within it self, and that the <span class="varspell" title="defense">defence</span> only of the church belongs to the magistrate. Had he once learnt not further to concern himself with church affairs, half his labor might be <span class="varspell" title="spared">spar'd</span>, and the commonwealth better tended. To which end, that which I <span class="varspell" title="premised">premis'd</span> in the beginning, and in due place treated of more at large, I desire now concluding, that they would consider seriously what religion is: and they  will find it to be, in <span class="varspell" title="sum">summe</span>, both our <span class="varspell" title="belief">beleef</span> and our <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span> depending upon God only. That there can be no place then left for the magistrate or his force in the settlement of religion, by appointing either what we shall <span class="varspell" title="believe">beleeve</span> in divine things or <span class="varspell" title="practice">practise</span> in religious (neither of which things are in the power of man either to perform himself or to enable others), I <span class="varspell" title="persuade">perswade</span> me in the Christian <span class="varspell" title="ingenuity">ingenuitie</span> of all religious men, the more they <span class="varspell" title="examine">examin</span> seriously, the more they will <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> <span class="varspell" title="clearly">cleerly</span> to be true: and <span class="varspell" title="find">finde</span> how false and deceivable that common saying is, which is so much <span class="varspell" title="relied">reli'd</span> upon, that the Christian Magistrate is <span class="mi">custos utriusque tabul&aelig;</span>, keeper of both tables; unless is meant by keeper the defender only: neither can that maxim be <span class="varspell" title="maintained">maintaind</span> by any <span class="varspell" title="proof">prooff</span> or argument which hath not in this discourse first or last <span class="varspell" title="been">bin</span> refuted. For the two tables, or ten <span class="varspell" title="commandments">commandements</span>, teach our <span class="varspell" title="duty">dutie</span> to God and our <span class="varspell" title="neighbor">neighbour</span> from the love of both; give magistrates no <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> to force either: they seek that from the judicial law; though on false grounds, especially in the first table, as I have <span class="varspell" title="shown">shewn</span>; and both in first and second execute that <span class="varspell" title="authority">autoritie</span> for the most part not according to <span class="varspell" title="God's">Gods</span> judicial laws but <span class="varspell" title="their">thir</span> own. As for civil crimes and of the outward man, which all are not, no not of those against the second table, as that of coveting; in them what power they have, they had from the beginning, long before <span class="mi">Moses</span> or the two tables were in being.  And whether they be not now as little in being to be kept by any Christian as they are two legal tables, <span class="varspell" title="remains">remanes</span> yet as undecided, as it is sure they never were yet <span class="varspell" title="delivered">deliverd</span> to the keeping of any Christian magistrate. But of these things, perhaps, more some other time; what may serve the present hath been above <span class="varspell" title="discoursed">discourst</span> sufficiently out of the scriptures: and to those <span class="varspell" title="produced">produc'd</span> might be added testimonies, examples, experiences of all succeeding ages to these times asserting this doctrine: but having <span class="varspell" title="herein">herin</span> the scripture so copious and so <span class="varspell" title="plain">plane</span>, we have all that can be properly <span class="varspell" title="called">calld</span> true strength and nerve; the rest would be but pomp and incumbrance. Pomp and ostentation of reading is <span class="varspell" title="admired">admir'd</span> among the vulgar: but doubtless in matters of religion, he is learnedest who is <span class="varspell" title="plainest">planest</span>. The <span class="varspell" title="brevity">brevitie</span> I use, not exceeding a small manual, will not <span class="varspell" title="therfore">therfore</span>, I suppose, be thought the less considerable, unless with them perhaps who think that great books only can <span class="varspell" title="determine">determin</span> great matters. I rather chose the common rule, not to make much ado where less may serve, which in controversies and those especially of religion, would make them less tedious, and by consequence read ofter, by many more, and with more benefit.</p>
