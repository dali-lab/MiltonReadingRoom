"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. This poem was occasioned, as the poem clearly states, by John Rouse\'s request that Milton send him another copy of his 1645 collection, <a href=\"../1645_title/text.shtml\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Poems Both English and Latin, Compos\'d at Several Times</span></a>.  Milton had apparently sent all of his published works (up until early 1647) to the <a href=\"http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/\" target=\"main\">Bodleian Library</a> at Oxford, and this volume had been lost, perhaps along the way there.  Milton enclosed an MS of this poem between the English and the Latin poems in the new volume he sent to Rouse.  He then published this poem in the <a href=\"../1673/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">second edition of this collection in 1673</a>.</p><p class=\"next\">John Rouse was elected Bodley\'s Librarian in 1620, at the age of 29.  he died on April 3, 1652.</p><p class=\"next\">The translation follows that of <a href=\"../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mackellar_latin\" target=\"main\">Walter MacKellar</a> with a few changes based on consulting <a href=\"../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#columbia_milton\" target=\"main\">The Columbia Milton</a> and <a href=\"../bibliography/f-h/text.shtml#hughes\" target=\"main\">Merritt Y.

"public":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>public library.</i>  The <a href=\"http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/\" target=\"main\">Bodleian Library</a> is not and never was a public library in the way we understand the phrase today.  It is the chief research library of Oxford University and its statutes forbid lending items to anyone, let alone the public.  Indeed John Rouse made a stir when he refused to lend King Charles I a book from the collection, citing the statutes of the Library (<a href=\"../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#mackellar_latin\" target=\"main\">Walter MacKellar</a> 64).</span>",
"twofold":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Two-fold book rejoicing in a single dress.</i>  Milton\'s first collection of poems, published by Humphrey Moseley in 1645, was indeed a double book bound as a single volume.  A special title page separated the Latin poems from the English (and a few Italian) verses that came before.  See the <a href=\"../1645_title/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">first title page</a> and the <a href=\"../poemata/title.shtml\" target=\"main\">second title page</a>.</span>",
"seasoned":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>seasoned poet.</i>  Milton actually presented his first publication of <span class=\"booktitle\">Poems</span> (1645) as a collection of juvenalia.  The <a href=\"../1645_title/frontispiece.shtml\" target=\"main\">frontispiece</a> to the volume, published when Milton was thirty-seven years old, pretends to present a poet of twenty-one years (<span class=\"mi\">Vigess: Pri:</span>).  Many of the poems\' titles include youthful dates as well, insisting on composition ages of sixteen and seventeen.</span>",
"ausonian":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Ausonian shades.</i>  Milton composed some of the poems in the 1645 collection while in Italy, sometimes called Ausonia.  See <a href=\"../sylvarum/salsillum/index.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"To Salsilli\"</a>, for example.</span>",
"aloof":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>aloof.</i>  Before travelling in Italy between April 1638 and late summer 1639, Milton had spent five years in fairly close retirement at his father\'s homes, studying poetry, philosphy, history and theology.  He did not take part in the political struggles dividing England until after his return from Italy.  In 1641 he joined the Puritan antiprelatical campaign with the publication of <span class=\"booktitle\">Of Reformation</span>.</span>",
"daunian":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Daunian quill.</i>  Italian pen, or Italian style of composition.  Daunia is a part of Apulia in southern Italy.</span>",
"father":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Cerulean father.</i>  Azure-colored father.  Milton refers to Oxford, even though the Thames actually begins some distance upstream from Oxford where the Isis flows into the Thames.</span>",
"strife":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>this accursed strife.</i>  The civil war, between Parliament and the King\'s supporters, broke out in 1642, four years before this poem\'s composition.  Until Charles I surrendered to Lord Fairfax on June 24, 1646, Oxford was the royalist army headquarters.</span>",
"pest":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>pest of Phineus.</i>  Phineus, son of Agenor, exercised his Apollo-given gift of prophecy too boldly for Zeus who, according to <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.9.21\" target=\"main\">Apollodorus\'s <span class=\"booktitle\">Library</span> 1.9</a>, punished him with a plague of harpies.  Milton refers to royalists and prelates as just such harpies.  See also Ovid\'s <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Ov.+Met.+7\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Metamorphoses</span> 7.2-4</a>.</span>",

She is called Actaean for Acte is an ancient name for Attica, or Athens.</span>",
"strophe":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>strophes.</i> In Greek choral and lyric poetry (and imitations of them), a series of lines forming a system, the metrical structure of which is repeated in a following system called the antistrophe.  \"Originally the word &sigma;&tau;&rho;&phi;&eta;, \'turning\', was applied to the movement of the chorus from right to left, and &alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&phi;&eta;, \'counter-turn\', to its returning movement from left to right; hence these terms became the designations of the portions of the choric ode sung during these movements respectively (<a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED</span> 2</a>).</span>",
"epode":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>epode.</i>  The part of a lyric ode sung after the strophe and antistrophe. </span>",
"schesin":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha; &nbsp; &sigma;&chi;&epsilon;&sigma;&iota;&nu;.</i>  The Greek words should have a grave accent over the second &alpha; in &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;, and acute accent over the &epsilon; in &sigma;&chi;&epsilon;&sigma;&iota;&nu;, a breath mark over the first &alpha; in  &alpha;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&epsilon;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;, and an acute accent over the last &epsilon;.   <i>Kata schesin</i>  means according to the system.  That is, some of the verses above follow the strophe/ antistrophe system, but some do not.  They are either monostrophic or <i>apolelumena</i>, or written at random with no prescribed meter.</span>",
"spondee":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Phalaeceans.</i>  Hendecasyllabic verses in which the third foot is a spondee instead of a trochee, or  &mdash; &mdash;| &mdash; &cup; &cup;| &mdash; &cup;| &mdash; &cup;.</p></div></body></html></span>"}
