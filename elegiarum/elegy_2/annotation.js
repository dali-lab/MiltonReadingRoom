"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. This poem eulogizes Senior Esquire Beadle Richard Ridding, M.A. of St. John\'s College who died in October or early November of 1626, during Milton\'s third (but second full) year at Christ\'s College, Cambridge.  He had served the university for thirty years and was probably regarded, somewhat like the <a href=\"../../university_carrier/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">university carrier</a> Milton eulogizes in a sonnet, as a fixture.  </p><p class=\"next\">Milton was almost eighteen at the time of Ridding\'s death, so he did not write this poem in \"his seventeenth year\" as some editors translate \"anno aetatis 17;\"  in his seventeenth year Milton would have been sixteen.

"beadle":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Beadle.</i> The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED</span> </a>offers this as its third definition for beadle: \"An apparitor or precursor who walks officially in front of dignitaries, a mace-bearer; a. spec. in the English universities (at present conventionally spelt bedel, &minus;ell,) the name of certain officials, formerly of two ranks distinguished as esquire bedels and yeomen bedels, having various functions as executive officers of the University. Their duties are now chiefly processional: at Oxford there are four, the junior- or sub-bedel being the official attendant of the Vice-chancellor, before whom he bears a silver staff or mace; at Cambridge there are two, called esquire-bedells, both of whom officially walk in front of the Vice-chancellor with maces.\"  This poem eulogizes Senior Esquire Beadle Richard Ridding, M.A. of St. John\'s College who died in October or early November of 1626, during Milton\'s third (but second full) year at Christ\'s College, Cambridge.
