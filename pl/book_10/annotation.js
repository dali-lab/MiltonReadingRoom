"farr":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>perfection farr excell\'d</i>.   Was Eve made to be \"but equal\" (147) to Adam in matters of guidance, or is this part of a rhetorical question with \"Superior,\" implying that Eve was neither superior or even equal to Adam in such matters?  The Son explicitly states that Adam, in his \"Manhood,\" was placed by God \"above her,\" since she was made of him, and that his \"perfection\" (or completeness) \"farr excelled\" hers in \"dignitie\" at least, if not in substance.  In <a href=\"../../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#wittreich\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Feminist Milton</span></a>, Joseph Wittreich appears to have misunderstood \"feminism\" more than he misunderstood Milton, but he ignores this passage and passages like it in <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#imageofgod\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span></a>.

"say":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Say Woman</i>.   Does the Son\'s use of \"Woman\" echo Adam\'s above (line 137)?  Is it meant as a term of derision, or at least lack of respect?  It certainly is different from the glorious epithets Adam routinely (and Raphael occasionally) applies to Eve earlier in the poem.</span>",
"line167":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Line 167</i>.   \"Since the serpent cannot speak, he cannot accuse Satan; and hence the first instance of God\'s justice after the fall is the condemnation of the only wholly innocent party to the crime.\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#orgel\" target=\"main\">Orgel &amp; Goldberg</a> 908).  The problem of the serpent\'s guilt or innocence occupied many biblical commentators:  see the <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Genesis/3.html\" target=\"main\">Geneva Bible comment</a>, for example; and <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol01/htm/ix.htm\" target=\"main\">Calvin\'s effort</a>.  The Father has already said \"Conviction to the serpent none belongs\" (line 84), but Milton here tries to rationalize the serpent\'s punishment as recorded in the Genesis story &mdash; though innocent, the serpent\'s body has been \"vitiated in nature\" (line 169) and so can never again be as it originally was created.</span>",
"mysterious":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>in mysterious terms</i>.  In Milton\'s usage, this usually means \"allegorically,\" though some Miltonists would prefer the term \"typologically.\"  The implication, however, is that the punishment of the serpent is not really what it appears to be, but something else; it signifies or stands in for the punishment of Satan.  Milton\'s use of the term in other places is interesting to trace:  <a href=\"../../penseroso/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Il Penseroso</span> 147</a>,  <a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">PL</span> 3.516</a>, <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#parts\" target=\"main\">4.312</a>, <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">4.741</a>, <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#mysterious2\" target=\"main\">4.750</a>, <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">8.599</a>, <a href=\"../../reason/book_2/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Reason of Church Government</span> 2</a>, <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span> Genesis</a>, and later in <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#mysterious2\" target=\"main\">the same</a>.

"submit":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Thine shall submit</i>.   Some commentators read this as the first institution of Eve\'s submission to Adam, but Milton has been clear that Eve submitted to Adam as her superior long before the fall (<a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#cling\" target=\"main\">4.440-43</a> and <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#manlygrace\" target=\"main\">4.490</a>).  In the Genesis account, this is the advent of Eve\'s requirement to submit.  Others see the reiteration of submission as an apt accompaniment to the pain-in-childbirth punishment.  Otherwise Eve might respond by saying she will never submit to Adam\'s desire and so avoid the punishment.

This may be a parodic image of the Pope and his symbolic mace; the Pope was often referred to in Latin as <span class=\"booktitle\">Pontifex maximus</span>, or the greatest bridge builder, alluding to his role as uniter of the Church Universal (or Catholic).

"strook":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>planet-strook</i>.   Suffering from unfavorable planetary influence.  A baffling conundrum, Milton seems to be suggesting that the malign effects of planets and constellations originate with Sin and Death (set at liberty by Adam\'s disobedience), so that here planets and stars are the first to be \"planet-strook.\"  Belief in astrology was by no means universal in Milton\'s or even Shakespeare\'s day; see Edmund\'s mocking speech in <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Shakespeare/lear/lear.1.2.html#120\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">King Lear</span> 1.2.129-45</a>.</span>",

The question is whether, in Milton\'s cosmology, darkness and/or Night antedates creation.  Certainly <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/g/geneva/notes/Genesis/1.html\" target=\"main\">Genesis 1.2 (Geneva)</a> suggests that the \"darkness\" on the \"face of the deep\" antedates God\'s creative activity, and Milton refers to Chaos as \"The womb of nature\" and \"perhaps\" full of the \"dark materials\" out of which God might \"create more worlds\" if he so chooses (<a href=\"../book_2/text.shtml#womb\" target=\"main\">2.911-916</a>; see <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol01/htm/vii.htm\" target=\"main\">Calvin\'s Commentary [\"bohu\"]</a>).  \"Darkness profound/ Cover\'d th\'Abyss\" we are told in book 7 as the Son rides in \"Paternal Glorie\" into Chaos to begin creation (<a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#darkness\" target=\"main\">7.233-34</a>).  On his trip across Chaos, Satan meets \"Sable-vested <span class=\"mi\">Night</span>, eldest of things\" and Chaos\'s consort (<a href=\"../book_2/text.shtml#nethermost\" target=\"main\">2.962</a>).  Since book 7 speaks of God as having created light (<a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#line243\" target=\"main\">7.243</a>) and then divided it from \"darkness\" (<a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#tabernacle\" target=\"main\">7.250-51</a>), perhaps this suggests that darkness is \"unoriginal\" in Orgel and Goldberg\'s sense of not created.  And perhaps when God calls the darkness \"Night\" (<a href=\"../book_7/text.shtml#tabernacle\" target=\"main\">7. 251-52</a>; <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+1&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 1</a>: 5), Night came into being, but darkness existed already.</span>",
"fierce":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fiercely opposed</i>.   In fact, Night offered no opposition, and Chaos offered Satan what direction he could: see book<a href=\"../book_2/text.shtml#aided\" target=\"main\">2.999-1009</a>.  But perhaps there is a distinction to be made between the place, Chaos, a place very difficult for Satan to negotiate, and the personification, \"Chaos,\" who offers to help Satan.  See Schwartz, <a href=\"../../bibliography/r-s/text.shtml#schwartz\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Remembering</span></a> on the matter of an ambivalent Chaos.</span>",
"apple":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>an Apple</i>.   Of course Genesis never specifies what sort of fruit grew on the Tree of  Knowledge, but Satan reduces it to a common apple both here and in <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#apples\" target=\"main\">9.585</a>.  The narrator in <a href=\"../../pr/book_2/text.shtml#apple\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Regain\'d</span> 2.349</a> also calls the fruit an apple and Milton refers to it as an apple in <a href=\"../../areopagitica/text.shtml#apple\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Areopagitica</span></a>.</span>",

"bait":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>bait of Eve</i>.   The narrator\'s use of the word \"bait\" is troubling, since it implies entrapment.  Are we to regard Eve as entrapped and deceived, but Adam as undeceived and so more precisely transgressive?  See <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#not_deceived\" target=\"main\">9.997-999</a>.</span>",

"oops":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Ops</i>.   Rhea, Saturn\'s wife.</span>",
"body":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>now in body</i>.

Perhaps the passage also suggests that Adam\'s transgression has now given a body to what was once a personified abstract power; he has embodied Sin.

"inman":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>I in Man residing</i>.   That is, Sin living in human beings and so congenitally infecting them.  The image certainly encourages the idea that what is sinful in Man is feminine as Sin is feminine (daughter of Satan).

"andequal":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>And equal</i>.   The punishment should fit the crime, and because Adam\'s crime is that his will and being are separated, his body should be destroyed.</span>",
"beget":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>beget</i>.   See <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Isaiah+45&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Isaiah 45</a>: 10.  1674 has no end-of-line punctuation; 1667 has a colon.</span>",

"thou":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Thou didst accept them</i>.  Again Adam addresses himself in the second person.</span>",
"allofme":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>All of me then shall die</i>.   Adam reasons his way to mortalism, the (heretical) doctrine that souls die along with bodies.</span>",
"line801":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Line 801</i>.   Although both 1674 and 1667  have a comma after \"he\", almost all modern editors omit it.  Since commas in <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> indicate speech breaks and breaths, and this seems not an likely place for Adam to breath or pause, I have left the comma.</span>",

"mindwill":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Mind and Will deprav\'d</i>.   All humanity, according to this doctrine, bears some moral depravity, a legacy of original sin.</span>",
"absolve":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Forc\'t I absolve</i>.   Adam feels compelled to admit that God is justified in punishing him.  So Adam (as the angels in lines 643-645 above) concludes the theodical argument of the poem.  See <a href=\"../book_1/text.shtml#justify\" target=\"main\">1.26</a>.</span>",
"adamme":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>On mee, mee onely</i>.   See <a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#sacrifice\" target=\"main\">3.236-37</a>, the Son\'s assumption of responsibility, and Eve\'s  statement of blame below at <a href=\"text.shtml#eveme\" target=\"main\">935-6</a>.</span>",

"denounced":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>denounc\'t</i>.   Proclaimed or announced.</span>",
"thou2":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>thou Serpent</i>.   \"It has been noted as early as the ancient rabbinic commentators that the name Eve is related to old Semitic words, that is, in Phoenician and Aramaic, for \'serpent\'\" (<a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#orgel\" target=\"main\">Orgel &amp; Goldberg</a> 913).</span>",
"pretend":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>pretended</i>.   Literally, stretched out.  See <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>.</span>",
"longing":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>longing to be seen</i>.  This accusation, though unfair in the instance Adam specifies, does however indicate the character of Eve\'s desire &mdash; the desire to be desired;  see the \"watry image\" episode in <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#bending\" target=\"main\">4.461-66</a>.</span>",
"overween":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>overweening</i>.   Arrogant.</span>",
"shew":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>but a shew</i>.  See Raphael\'s characterization of Eve\'s beauty as \"shews\" rather than \"reality\" in <a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#realities\" target=\"main\">8.575</a>.</span>",
"lefties":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>part sinister</i>.   Left, or ominous, side.  Adam\'s antifeminist diatribe has a long tradition in popular literature and invites comparison to the Chorus\'s lines in <a href=\"../../samson/drama/text.shtml#line1025\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span> 1025-60</a>.</span>",
"super":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>supernumerarie</i>.   Reference to the traditional belief that Adam was made with an extra, thirteenth, rib for the later creation of Eve.  Milton almost certainly did not hold this opinion.</span>",
"novelty":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>noveltie</i>.   Adam points out that Eve was created second and so was \"novel\" compared to the creation of man.  Contemporary writers, both pro- and antifeminist, argued about the significance of firstness and lastness in creation.  Humans were created last, some said, to signify their superiority to all else, so also women compared to men.  Adam argues that secondariness implies inferiority, even pointless novelty.  See Mary Nyquist,<a href=\"../../bibliography/n-q/text.shtml#nyquist\" target=\"main\"> \"The Genesis of Gendered Subjectivity.\"</a></span>",
"feminine":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>without Feminine</i>.   Adam\'s notion that all angels are \"Spirits Masculine\" (line 890) appears  true to Milton\'s imagined universe, but not quite in the negative way he intends it here.  True we never hear of an angel in <span class=\"booktitle\">Paradise Lost</span> that is referred to as \"she\" or has a feminine name.  It is also true that angels can \"either sex assume, or both\" whenever they wish (<a href=\"../book_1/text.shtml#psellus\" target=\"main\">1.424</a>).  Still, no angel, fallen or unfallen, appears as a female in this poem or any other of Milton\'s poems.  Raphael speaks very highly and honorably of Eve, never suggesting she is superfluous or serpent-like, or a novelty, though he does say she is clearly inferior to Adam  and more given to \"shows\" than to \"realities\" (<a href=\"../book_8/text.shtml#weigh\" target=\"main\">8.570-575</a>).  Eve says as much in <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#yielded\" target=\"main\">4.489-91</a>.  Milton embraces much the same misogynistic lore as Adam, but without the bitter sneering attitude.  See also <a href=\"../../tetrachordon/genesis/text.shtml#himnotthem\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Tetrachordon</span></a>.</span>",
"sex":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>strait conjunction</i>.   Close connection; \"conjunction\" was often taken to mean both marriage and sexual intercourse at the time.</span>",
"mate":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>fit Mate</i>.   A translation of \"help meet\" from <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Genesis 2</a>:18.  See also <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#conversation\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span> 1.2</a> and <a href=\"../../ddd/book_1/text.shtml#mistaken\" target=\"main\">1.3</a>.</span>",
"tresses":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>tresses all disorderd</i>.   Eve seems genuinely repentant, with her gentle words and supplication to Adam.  Compare with Adam\'s unrighteous anger and blame.  The mention of hair and feet recalls the image of Mary Magdalene and Jesus in <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Luke+7&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Luke 7</a>:38.</span>",
"deceived":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>deceav\'d</i>.   See <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=1+Timothy+2&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">1 Timothy 2</a>: 13-14 and book <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#not_deceived\" target=\"main\">9.998-999</a>.</span>",
"eveme":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Mee mee onely</i>.   See <a href=\"text.shtml#adamme\" target=\"main\">832</a> for Adam\'s mirror line, and <a href=\"../book_3/text.shtml#sacrifice\" target=\"main\">3.236-37</a> for the Son\'s.</span>",
"hisaide":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>his aide</i>.   Eve\'s submission helps Adam return to himself;  it is important not to mistake Eve\'s submission, which according to Milton is proper to her creation, for the kind of sacrifice the Son offers.  Critics who refer to Eve\'s offer to take the punishment upon herself as Christ-like make what Milton would probably consider a category mistake.</span>",
"lest":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>lest part</i>.  An unusually clumsy-sounding line:  \"You are not well able to endure the full wrath of him (God) whose anger you only as yet feel the teeniest part.\"</span>",
"adamshead":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>on my head</i>.   Contrast with <a href=\"text.shtml#sharepunish\" target=\"main\">133</a>, where Adam freely laid much of the blame on Eve before God.</span>",
"derived2":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>deriv\'d</i>.   Passed down.</span>",
"livedie":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Living or dying</i>.  These words echo Adam\'s reasons for partaking of the fruit in <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#deathaslife\" target=\"main\">9.954</a>, where he declares he would rather die than lose Eve.</span>",
"evils":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>As in our evils</i>.   In such an evil situation as ours.</span>",
"descent":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>descent</i>.   Descendants.</span>",
"unbegot":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>yet unbegot</i>.   Eve\'s words would imply that Adam and Eve have, as yet, conceived no offspring even though they have certainly had conjugal relations (<a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#mysterious\" target=\"main\">4.741-743</a>).  Aside from Milton, most commentators believed that Adam and Eve did not experience coitus until after the fall.  Augustine believed that sexual intercourse would have been entirely without lust, and so without shame before the fall, and that it is never free of lust or shame after the fall.  See Augustine, <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-20.htm#P2273_1300432\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">City of God</span> 14</a>.21.</span>",
"death":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>So Death</i>.   In 1674 and 1667, these words appear here, but  almost all editors have moved it back to the end of 989 to regularize the meter.  I have preferred to leave it as it is in 1674.</span>",
"conversing":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Conversing</i>.   Cohabiting.</span>",
"present":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>present object</i>.   Eve herself, standing in Adam\'s presence.</span>",
"miserie":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>miserie</i>.   Misprinted \"meserie\" in 1674, but \"miserie\" in <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/55152/145\" target=\"main\">1667 (9.997)</a>.</span>",
"attentive":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>his more attentive minde</i>.   See \"higher intellectual\" in <a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#tempt\" target=\"main\">9.483</a>.</span>",
"contumacy":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>contumacie</i>.   Willful disobedience.</span>",
"reluctance":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Reluctance</i>.   Struggling, resistance.</span>",
"fruit":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Fruit of thy Womb</i>.   The phrase echoes <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Luke+1&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Luke 1</a>: 42.</span>",
"aslope":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>aslope</i>.   Falling aslant, missing the true target.  Adam is attempting to make the best of the situation.</span>",
"sunshine":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>this diurnal star</i>.   The sun.</span>",
"sere":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>with matter sere foment</i>.   That is, kindle a fire by directing the sun\'s beams onto dry kindling (\"matter sere\"). </span>",
"attrite":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>attrite</i>.   Worked by friction.  Milton imagines that Adam knows instinctively how to kindle fire, but it is a skill called forth by the necessities of fallenness.  Fire was considered unneccesary before; see <a href=\"../book_5/text.shtml#dinner\" target=\"main\">5.331-49</a>.</span>",
"tine":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Tine</i>.   Kindle.</span>",
"stop":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>thwart</i>.   Slanting.</span>",
"supplie":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>supplie the Sun</i>.   That is, replace the sun\'s energy.  Before sinning, Adam was \"Guiltless of fire\" (<a href=\"../book_9/text.shtml#no_fire\" target=\"main\">9.392</a>) because it was unnecessary.</span>",
"oftening":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Frequenting</i>.   Filling.</span>",
"romeo":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Lines 1089-92 and 1101-03</i>.   Some readers find the repetition  of lines 1086-1092 in lines 1098-1104 jarring; others find it a soothing coda. Given that there are several echoes of the <a href=\"http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1559/Communion_1559.htm\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Book of Common Prayer</span> (1559)</a> (search \"humbly\") in Adam\'s speech, perhaps the repetition suggests that there is something more of ritual prescription to Adam\'s interactions with God than there was before the fall.  See <a href=\"../book_4/text.shtml#line735\" target=\"main\">4.736-738</a>, for example, where Adam and Eve spontaneously and unritualistically speak an evening prayer.</p></div></body> </html> </span>"}
