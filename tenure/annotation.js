var annotList = {"intro":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Introduction</i>. <span class=\"booktitle\">The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates</span>   (<span class=\"booktitle\">TKM</span>) tries to be several things at once&mdash;a closely argued and authoritatively   supported treatise in political science, a polemical pamphlet, and an essay   in biblical interpretation. In her recent <a href=\"../bibliography/l-m/text.shtml#barbara_lewalski\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">The   Life of John Milton</span></a>, Barbara Lewalski describes its various generic   elements: \"Several elements are intertwined here, somewhat disjointedly: castigation   of backsliding Presbyterians, rhetorical appeals to the fragmenting revolutionary   parties, defenses of tyrannicide, and development of a republican political   theory derived from classical and contemporary sources, and the Bible\"    (230). For all of its claims to be chiefly a work of theory, there\'s much to   be gained from reading it as an occasional piece, prompted by one of England\'s   most important political emergencies.</p> <p class=\"next\"> By December   1648, King Charles I\'s royalist forces had been utterly defeated by the Parliamentary   Army led by Generals <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=34180\" target=\"main\">Thomas   Fairfax</a> and <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=117760\" target=\"main\">Oliver   Cromwell</a>. Attempts to come to some compromise with the King had all failed   and there was very good reason to suspect that the King and his agents were   negotiating (when they agreed to negotiate at all) in bad faith. Still, many   in Parliament, including some Presbyterians who had supported war against the   king for nearly seven years, balked at the idea of trying King Charles I for   treason, and deposing and executing him. Milton argues that these procedures,   however radical they may appear, are nothing more than the logical and necessary   extension of having waged a just war on a tyrant who remains unrepentant and   a danger to the commonwealth. </p>  <p class=\"next\">On the sixth   of December, 1648, <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?tocId=9061356\" target=\"main\">Colonel   Thomas Pride</a> led troops into the House of Commons and forcibly ejected royalist   and Presbyterian supporters of rapprochement with the King. The remaining members,   known as the Rump Parliament empowered a commision to try the king for treason;   it found him guilty and deposed and executed him on January 30, 1649. Milton   wrote <span class=\"booktitle\">TKM</span> at this moment in support of the Rump and the Army. Though   he argues forcefully for the right of a people to re-assume its natural and   God-given right of popular sovereignty, he never addresses the crucial issue   of whether the Rump or the Army that shaped it could justly be said to represent   the sovereignty of a free-born people. By March, Milton had been appointed to   a post&mdash;Secretary for Foreign Tongues&mdash;in the new commonwealth government   shorn of the king (though not entirely of monarchy) and the House of Lords.<br />  </span>",
"introdate":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i></i></p>  <p class=\"next\">The   first edition of <span class=\"booktitle\">TKM</span> is <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/imagelist?id=12296190\" target=\"main\">dated 1649 on its title page</a> and runs to forty-two   quarto pages. The second edition runs to sixty quarto pages, adding a number   of quotations, paraphrases, and citations from Protestant authors, continental,   English, and Scottish. Some second edition copies are <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/59034\" target=\"main\">dated 1649</a> and <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/59372\" target=\"main\">some 1650</a>. The Julian Calendar,   which sets the new year on March 25, and the Gregorian Calendar, promulgated   by a papal bull of 1582, were variously used by English printers well into the   seventeenth century.

"title":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates.</i> The complete   title from the 1650 edition is \"The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates: Proving,   That it is Lawfull, and hath been held so through all Ages, for any, who have   the Power, to call to account a Tyrant,or wicked King, and after due conviction,   to depose, and put him to death; if the ordinary Magistrate have neglected,   or deny\'d to doe it. And that they, who of late so much blame Deposing, are   the Men that did it themselves. <span class=\"booktitle\"> Published now the second time with some   additions, and many Testimonies also added out of the best &amp; learnedest among   Protestant Divines asserting the position of this book</span>.\"</span>",

"custom":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Custom.</i> By capitalizing the word, Milton appears   almost ready to personify Custom as he did in the opening address <a href=\"../ddd/parliament/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"To   Parlament\"</a> in <span class=\"booktitle\">The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span> (1644).</span>",
"offended":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>offended.</i> Attacked.</span>",
"naturally":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>naturally servile.</i> That some beings -- women,   slaves and animals in particular -- are naturally inferior to others and therefore   naturally serve their superiors, Aristotle argues at some length in his <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Pol.+1254b\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Politics</span>   1254b</a>-1255a. </span>",
"negligently":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>That doe the worke of the Lord negligently.</i>   Milton\'s printed marginal note refers readers to \"Jer. 48. 19,\" but that is   probably a missprint for <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=JER+48&amp;language=english&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"main\">Jeremiah   48.10</a>: \"Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed   be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.\" Thus Milton implies that those   Presbyterians who had made war on King Charles I but stopped short of trying   and executing him are like the Moabites Jeremiah curses. See the <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=117760\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Encyclopedia   Britannica</span></a> article on Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton.</span>",

"palterd":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>palter\'d.</i> Equivocated.</span>",
"faction":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Faction.</i> The faction or party Milton refers to   is the Presbyterian leadership in Parliament. They were prepared to come to   terms with King Charles I if only he would agree to establish Presyterianism   in England as it had been established in Scotland. Indeed, in the Engagement   of December 26, 1648, Charles had promised (under pressure) the Scottish Commissioners   that Presbyterianism would be established for three years and that he would   suppress Independency. Milton regarded this as treachery against the republican   cause and against those independents who helped Parliament win the civil war. </span>",
"hewhom":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>he toward whom they boasted thir new fidelitie.</i>   That is, King Charles I, who boasted to others that his promises to establish   Presbyterianism and suppress Independency were but pretenses to buy him time.</span>",
"traytors":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Traytors death.</i> That is to say that given half   a chance King Charles would have hanged the Presbyterian leaders as traitors   along with the Independents who helped them defeat the King\'s forces. </span>",

"gibrish":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>gibrish Lawes.</i> Milton shared the <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=49093\" target=\"main\">Levellers</a>   contempt for the Norman   laws which he regarded as corruptions of the more pure and fundamental laws   of Saint Edward. Law French as used in English courts of the day might well   have sounded like gibberish to many.</span>",
"nero":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>Nero.</i> Often used as an example of the worst sort   of tyrant, <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=56702\" target=\"main\">Nero</a>   was emperor of Rome from 37-68 CE. </span>",

"revelation":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>immediat Revelation.</i> That is to say, unmediated   or direct revelation from God. Perhaps Milton means something like the \"intimate   impulse\" and inward \"rouzing motion\" he describes Samson as experiencing in   <a href=\"../samson/drama/text.shtml#motiond\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Samson Agonistes</span>   221-22</a> and <a href=\"../samson/drama/text.shtml#rousing\" target=\"main\">1382-83</a>.   Apart from such direct revelation, Justice and Victory are the supreme warrants   for the exercise of supreme power. Such notions sort well with classic republicanism,   but hardly with modern notions of democracy.</span>",
"memento":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>memento\'s.</i> Milton refers somewhat sneeringly   to William Prynne\'s <a href=\"http://wwwlib.umi.com/eebo/image/116132\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">A   Briefe Memento</span></a> (1649) which argued against the trial of the king.</span>",
"masculine":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>unmaskuline Rhetorick.</i> John Gauden had argued   in a pamphlet published on January 5 1649 that in showing pity on King Charles   I, the Parliament and the Army would not be acting \"foolish and <span class=\"booktitle\">feminine</span>,\"   but \"<span class=\"booktitle\">masculine</span>, Heroick, truly Christian and Divine\" (Hughes, <a href=\"../bibliography/t-z/text.shtml#Yale\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">Complete   Prose</span></a> 3.191n).

Milton mocks devotion   to this model of church government in his sonnet <a href=\"../conscience/text.shtml\" target=\"main\">\"On   the New Forcers of Conscience\"</a> line 7.</span>",
"pluralities":"<span class=\"annotation\"><i>pluralities.</i> The system or practice of more   than one benefice (church appointment) being held at the same time by one person   (<a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" target=\"main\"><span class=\"booktitle\">OED2</span></a>),   generally regarded by Puritans as a corrupt practice.

Many Independents opposed <a href=\"http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article?eu=74548\" target=\"main\">tithes</a>,   and Milton argued that they had no scriptural basis and impugned Christian and   English liberty. </span>",

This passage was quoted by many political theorists as a biblical   injunction against insurrection or disobedience of any established authority,   but others claimed that the injunction did not hold in cases of authorities   that failed to punish evildoers, or indeed did evil themselves. </span>",
